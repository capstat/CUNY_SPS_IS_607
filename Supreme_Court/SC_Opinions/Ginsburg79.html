				Michigan has a two-tier appellate system.  The State Supreme Court hears appeals by leave only.  The intermediate Court of Appeals adjudicates appeals as of right from criminal convictions, except that a defendant convicted on a guilty or nolo contendere
				 plea who seeks intermediate appellate court review must apply for leave to appeal.  Under Michigan law, most indigent defendants convicted on a plea must proceed 
				<em>
					pro se
				</em>
				 in seeking leave to appeal to the intermediate court.  In 
				<em>
					People 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, the Michigan Supreme Court held that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>&#x92;s Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses do not secure a right to appointed counsel for plea-convicted defendants seeking review in the intermediate appellate court for these reasons: Such review is discretionary; plea proceedings are shorter, simpler, and more routine than trials; and a defendant entering a plea accedes to the State&#x92;s fundamental interest in finality.

				Petitioner Halbert pleaded

				to two counts of criminal sexual conduct.  During Halbert&#x92;s plea colloquy, the trial court advised him of instances in which it &#x93;must&#x94; or &#x93;may&#x94; appoint appellate counsel, but failed to tell him that it could not appoint counsel in any other circumstances, including Halbert&#x92;s own case.  The day after his sentence was imposed, Halbert moved to withdraw his plea.  Denying the motion, the trial court stated that Halbert&#x92;s proper remedy was to appeal to the State Court of Appeals.  Twice thereafter, Halbert asked the trial court to appoint counsel to help him prepare an application for leave to appeal to the intermediate court, stating that his sentence had been misscored, that he needed counsel to preserve the issue before undertaking an appeal, that he had learning disabilities and was mentally impaired, and that he had been obliged to rely on fellow inmates in preparing his

				Two aspects of the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; process following plea-based convictions compel the conclusion that 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, not 
				<em>
					Ross,
				</em>
				 controls here.  First, in ruling on an application for leave to appeal, that court looks to the merits of the appellant&#x92;s claims.  Second, indigent defendants pursuing first-tier review in the Court of Appeals are generally ill equipped to represent themselves.  A defendant who pleads guilty or 
				<em>
					nolo contendere 
				</em>
				in a Michigan court, although he relinquishes access to an appeal as of right, is entitled to apply for leave to appeal, and that entitlement is officially conveyed to him.  Of critical importance, the intermediate appellate court, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court, sits as an error-correction instance.  A court Rule provides that the intermediate court may respond to a leave application in a number of ways: It may grant or deny the application, enter a final decision, grant other relief, request additional material from the record, or require a certified concise statement of proceedings and facts from the lower court.  The court&#x92;s response to the leave application by any of these alternatives&#x97;including denial of leave&#x97;necessarily entails some evaluation of the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims.  Pp. 9&#x96;10.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				This Court rejects Michigan&#x92;s argument that 
				<em>
					Ross 
				</em>
				is dispositive here because review in the intermediate appellate court following a plea-based conviction is discretionary, given the necessity of filing an application for leave to appeal.  The 
				<em>
					Ross
				</em>
				 Court recognized that leave-granting determinations by a State&#x92;s highest court turn on considerations other than a lower court&#x92;s commission of error, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, the involvement of a matter of &#x93;significant public interest.&#x94;  417 U. S., at 615.  Michigan&#x92;s Supreme Court, like the highest courts of other States, sits not to correct errors in individual cases, but to decide matters of larger public import.  By contrast, the intermediate court, as an error-correction instance, is guided in responding to leave to appeal applications by the merits of the particular defendant&#x92;s claims, not by the general importance of the questions presented.  Pp. 10&#x96;11.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				Whether formally categorized as the decision of an appeal or the disposal of a leave application, the intermediate appellate court&#x92;s ruling on a plea-convicted defendant&#x92;s claims provides the first, and likely the only, direct review the defendant&#x92;s conviction and sentence will receive.  Parties like Halbert, however, are disarmed in their endeavor to gain first-tier review.  
				<em>
					Ross
				</em>
				 emphasized that a defendant seeking State Supreme Court review following a first-tier appeal as of right earlier had the assistance of appellate counsel, who will have reviewed the trial court record, researched the legal issues, and prepared a brief reflecting that review and research.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  Such a defendant may also be armed with an opinion of the intermediate appellate court addressing the issues counsel raised.  Without such guides keyed to a court of review, a 
				<em>
					pro se 
				</em>
				applicant&#x92;s entitlement to seek leave to appeal to Michigan&#x92;s intermediate court may be more formal than real.  Cf.

				<em>
					id.

				, at ___ &#x96; ___.  The State does have a legitimate interest in reducing its judiciary&#x92;s workload, but providing indigents with appellate counsel will yield applications easier to comprehend.  Michigan&#x92;s Court of Appeals would still have recourse to summary denials of leave applications in cases not warranting further review.  And when a defendant&#x92;s case presents no genuinely arguable issue, appointed counsel may so inform the court.  Pp. 11&#x96;16.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				The Court disagrees with Michigan&#x92;s contention that, even if Halbert had a constitutionally guaranteed right to appointed counsel for first-level appellate review, he waived that right by entering a 
				<em>
					nolo contendere
				</em>
				 plea.  At the time he entered his plea, Halbert had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel he could elect to forgo.  Moreover, the trial court did not tell Halbert, simply and directly, that in his case, there would be no access to appointed counsel.  Cf.

				Two considerations were key to our decision in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 that a State is required to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant&#x92;s first-tier appeal as of right.  First, such an appeal entails an adjudication on the &#x93;merits.&#x94;  372 U. S., at 357.  Second, first-tier review differs from subsequent appellate stages &#x93;at which the claims have once been presented by [appellate counsel] and passed upon by an appellate court.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 356.  Under the California system at issue in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, the first-tier appellate court independently examined the record to determine whether to appoint counsel.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 355.  When a defendant able to retain counsel pursued an appeal, the 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 Court observed, &#x93;the appellate court passe[d] on the merits of [the] case only after having the full benefit of written briefs and oral argument by counsel.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 356.  In contrast, when a poor person appealed, &#x93;the appellate court [wa]s forced to prejudge the merits [of the case] before it c[ould] even determine whether counsel should be provided.&#x94;  Ibid.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				In Ross
				, we explained why the rationale of 
				<em>
					Douglas 
				</em>
				did not extend to the appointment of counsel for an indigent seeking to pursue a second-tier discretionary appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court or, thereafter, certiorari review in this Court.  The North Carolina Supreme Court, in common with this Court we perceived, does not sit as an error-correction instance.  417 U. S., at 615.  Principal criteria for state high court review, we noted, included &#x93;whether the subject matter of the appeal has significant public interest, whether the cause involves legal principles of major significance to the jurisprudence of the State, [and] whether the decision below is in probable conflict&#x94; with the court&#x92;s precedent.  
				<em>

				 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Further, we pointed out, a defendant who had already benefited from counsel&#x92;s aid in a first-tier appeal as of right would have, &#x93;at the very least, a transcript or other record of trial proceedings, a brief on his behalf in the Court of Appeals setting forth his claims of error, and in many cases an opinion by the Court of Appeals disposing of his case.&#x94;  Ibid.

				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 106&#x96;107.  As amended, the State Constitution provides: &#x93;In every criminal prosecution, the accused shall have the right &#x2026; to have an appeal as a matter of right, except as provided by law an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich.

				A defendant convicted by plea who seeks review in the Michigan Court of Appeals must now file an application for leave to appeal pursuant to Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205 (2005).  In response, the Court of Appeals may, among other things, &#x93;grant or deny the application; enter a final decision; [or] grant other relief.&#x94;  Rule 7.205(D)(2).  If the court grants leave, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right.&#x94;  Rule 7.205(D)(3).  The parties agree that the Court of Appeals, in its orders denying properly filed applications for leave, uniformly cites &#x93;lack of merit in the grounds presented&#x94; as the basis for its decision.

				Petitioner Halbert&#x92;s case is framed by two prior decisions of this Court concerning state-funded appellate counsel, 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>

				</em>
				.  The question before us is essentially one of classification: With which of those decisions should the instant case be aligned?

				  We hold that 
				<em>
					Douglas 
				</em>
				provides the controlling instruction.  Two aspects of the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; process following plea-based convictions lead us to that conclusion.  First, in determining how to dispose of an application for leave to appeal, Michigan&#x92;s intermediate appellate court looks to the merits of the claims made in the application.  Second, indigent defendants pursuing first-tier review in the Court of Appeals are generally ill equipped to represent themselves.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				A defendant who pleads guilty or 
				<em>
					nolo contendere 
				</em>
				in a Michigan court does not thereby forfeit all opportunity for appellate review.  Although he relinquishes access to an appeal as of right, he is entitled to apply for leave to appeal, and that entitlement is officially conveyed to him.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;5; Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(E)(2)(a) (2005) (&#x93;[T]he defendant is entitled to file an application for leave to appeal.&#x94;); see also Advice Concerning Right To Appeal, &#xB6;1, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 7, n. 1 (&#x93;You are entitled to file an application for leave to appeal with the Court of Appeals.&#x94;).  Of critical importance, the tribunal to which he addresses his application, the Michigan Court of Appeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court, sits as an error-correction instance.

				The Court of Appeals may respond to a leave application in a number of ways.  It &#x93;may grant or deny the application; enter a final decision; grant other relief; request additional material from the record; or require a certified concise statement of proceedings and facts from the court &#x2026; whose order is being appealed.&#x94;  Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(2) (2005).  When the court denies leave using the stock phrase &#x93;for lack of merit in the grounds presented,&#x94; its disposition may not be equivalent to a &#x93;final decision&#x94; on the merits, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the disposition may simply signal that the court found the matters asserted unworthy of the expenditure of further judicial resources.  But the court&#x92;s response to the leave application by any of the specified alternatives&#x97;including denial of leave&#x97;necessarily entails some evaluation of the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims.

				Michigan urges that review in the Court of Appeals following a plea-based conviction is as &#x93;discretionary&#x94; as review in the Michigan Supreme Court because both require an application for leave to appeal.  See

				  Therefore, Michigan maintains,

				<em>

				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, the involvement of a matter of &#x93;significant public interest.&#x94;  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4.  Michigan&#x92;s Supreme Court, too, sits not to correct errors in individual cases, but to decide matters of larger public import.  See Mich. Ct. Rule 7.302(B)(2)&#x96;(3) (2005) (criteria for granting leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court include whether a case presents an &#x93;issue [of] significant public interest&#x94; or &#x93;involves legal principles of major significance to the state&#x92;s jurisprudence&#x94;);

By contrast, the Michigan Court of Appeals, because it is an error-correction instance, is guided in responding to leave to appeal applications by the merits of the particular defendant&#x92;s claims, not by the general importance of the questions presented.

				Whether formally categorized as the decision of an appeal or the disposal of a leave application, the Court of Appeals&#x92; ruling on a plea-convicted defendant&#x92;s claims provides the first, and likely the only, direct review the defendant&#x92;s conviction and sentence will receive.  Parties like Halbert, however, are disarmed in their endeavor to gain first-tier review.  As the Court in 
				<em>
					Ross
				</em>
				 emphasized, a defendant seeking State Supreme Court review following a first-tier appeal as of right earlier had the assistance of appellate counsel.  The attorney appointed to serve at the intermediate appellate court level will have reviewed the trial court record, researched the legal issues, and prepared a brief reflecting that review and research.  417 U. S., at 615.  The defendant seeking second-tier review may also be armed with an opinion of the intermediate appellate court addressing the issues counsel raised.  A first-tier review applicant, forced to act 
				<em>
					pro se
				</em>
				, will face a record unreviewed by appellate counsel, and will be equipped with no attorney&#x92;s brief prepared for, or reasoned opinion by, a court of review.

						 Michigan provided Halbert with a form titled &#x93;Notice of Rights After Sentencing (After Plea of Guilty/Nolo Contendere) and Request for Appointment of Attorney.&#x94;  App. 46&#x96;50, 53&#x96;57.  Resembling the advice conveyed to Halbert by the trial judge, the form described the circumstances in which counsel must or may be appointed, but did not expressly state that, absent such circumstances, counsel would not be provided.  As revised, Michigan&#x92;s notice form now states: &#x93;You are not entitled to have a lawyer appointed at public expense to assist you in filing an application for leave to appeal &#x2026; .&#x94;  Advice Concerning Right To Appeal After Plea of Guilty/Nolo Contendere (rev. June 2004), available at http://courts.michigan.gov/scao/courtforms/appeals/cc265b.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 21, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).

						 The question at hand, all Members of the Court agree, is whether this case should be bracketed with Douglas v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/372/353" class="subref" title="subref">372 U. S. 353</a> (1963)
, because appointed counsel is sought for initial review before an intermediate appellate court, or with Ross v. Moffitt, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/600" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 600</a> (1974)
, because a plea-convicted defendant must file an application for leave to appeal.  See post, at 4 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (&#x93;Michigan&#x92;s system bears some similarity to the state systems at issue in both Douglas and Ross.&#x94;).

						 Both the majority and the dissent in People v. Bulger, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103 (2000), described the State&#x92;s intermediate appellate court&#x92;s function as error correction.  Compare id., at 516&#x96;518, 614 N. W. 2d, at 112&#x96;113 (in the majority&#x92;s view, the Court of Appeals could perform its review function, despite the defendant&#x92;s lack of representation, because plea-convicted defendants have ample aid for preservation of their claims in the trial court and ineffective assistance of counsel should be readily apparent to the Court of Appeals from the record), with id., at 543, 614 N. W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting) (&#x93;[T]he function of our Court of Appeals is reviewing the merits and correcting errors made by the lower courts.&#x94;).

						 The Bulger opinions nowhere describe the discretion exercised by the Michigan Court of Appeals as so unconstrained that it may &#x93;deny leave [to appeal] for any reason, or for no reason at all.&#x94;  Post, at 10 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Compare Bulger, 462 Mich., at 511, 614 N. W. 2d, at 110 (appeal to intermediate court is discretionary because a defendant must &#x93;obtai[n] leave&#x94;); id., at 506&#x96;508, 519, 614 N.

						 This assumes that trial counsel will recognize, in a postconviction motion, any issues appropriate for preservation for appellate review.  A lawyer may not, however, perceive his own errors or the need for such a motion.  Defense counsel here, for example, whose performance Halbert alleged to be ineffective, apparently did not assist Halbert in preparing and filing his motion to withdraw his plea.  See supra, at 8.

						 &#x93;No one questions,&#x94; the Bulger Court stated, &#x93;that the appointment of appellate counsel at state expense would be more efficient and helpful not only to defendants, but also to the appellate courts.&#x94;  462 Mich., at 520, 614 N. W. 2d, at 114.

						 Assuming, as Justice Thomas suggests, that whether Michigan law conferred on Halbert a post-plea right to appointed appellate counsel is irrelevant to whether Halbert waived a federal constitutional right to such counsel, post, at 16&#x96;17, the remainder of the dissent&#x92;s argument slips from my grasp, see post, at 17&#x96;18.  No conditional waiver&#x97;&#x93;on[e] in which a defendant agrees that, if he has &#x2026; a right, he waives it,&#x94; post, at 17&#x97;is at issue here.  Further, nothing in Halbert&#x92;s plea colloquy indicates that he waived an &#x93;unsettled,&#x94; but assumed, right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel, post-plea.  See post, at 17&#x96;18.

						 We are unpersuaded by the suggestion that, because a defendant may be able to waive his right to appeal entirely, Michigan can consequently exact from him a waiver of the right to government-funded appellate counsel.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 14.  Many legal rights are &#x93;presumptively waivable,&#x94; post, at 14 (Thomas, J., dissenting), and if Michigan were to require defendants to waive all forms of appeal as a condition of entering a plea, that condition would operate against moneyed and impoverished defendants alike.  A required waiver of the right to appointed counsel&#x92;s assistance when applying for leave to appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals, however, would accomplish the very result worked by Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000): It would leave indigents without access to counsel in that narrow range of circumstances in which, our decisions hold, the State must affirmatively ensure that poor defendants receive the legal assistance necessary to provide meaningful access to the judicial system.  See Douglas, 372 U. S., at 357&#x96;358; M. L. B., 519 U. S., at 110&#x96;113; cf. Griffin v. Illinois,

				In 1994, Michigan voters approved a proposal amending the State Constitution to provide that &#x93;an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich. Const., Art. 1, &#xA7;20.  Thereafter, &#x93;several Michigan state judges began to deny appointed appellate counsel to indigents&#x94; convicted by plea.

				<em>

				Two considerations were key to our decision in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 that a State is required to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant&#x92;s first-tier appeal as of right.  First, such an appeal entails an adjudication on the &#x93;merits.&#x94;  372 U. S., at 357.  Second, first-tier review differs from subsequent appellate stages &#x93;at which the claims have once been presented by [appellate counsel] and passed upon by an appellate court.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 356.  Under the California system at issue in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, the first-tier appellate court independently examined the record to determine whether to appoint counsel.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 355.  When a defendant able to retain counsel pursued an appeal, the 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 Court observed, &#x93;the appellate court passe[d] on the merits of [the] case only after having the full benefit of written briefs and oral argument by counsel.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 356.  In contrast, when a poor person appealed, &#x93;the appellate court [wa]s forced to prejudge the merits [of the case] before it c[ould] even determine whether counsel should be provided.&#x94;  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				In Ross
				, we explained why the rationale of 
				<em>
					Douglas 
				</em>
				did not extend to the appointment of counsel for an indigent seeking to pursue a second-tier discretionary appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court or, thereafter, certiorari review in this Court.  The North Carolina Supreme Court, in common with this Court we perceived, does not sit as an error-correction instance.  417 U. S., at 615.  Principal criteria for state high court review, we noted, included &#x93;whether the subject matter of the appeal has significant public interest, whether the cause involves legal principles of major significance to the jurisprudence of the State, [and] whether the decision below is in probable conflict&#x94; with the court&#x92;s precedent.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Further, we pointed out, a defendant who had already benefited from counsel&#x92;s aid in a first-tier appeal as of right would have, &#x93;at the very least, a transcript or other record of trial proceedings, a brief on his behalf in the Court of Appeals setting forth his claims of error, and in many cases an opinion by the Court of Appeals disposing of his case.&#x94;  Ibid.

				Michigan has a two-tier appellate system comprising the State Supreme Court and the intermediate Court of Appeals.  The Michigan Supreme Court hears appeals by leave only.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3(6) (West Supp. 2004).  Prior to 1994, the Court of Appeals adjudicated appeals as of right from all criminal convictions.  
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich., at 503&#x96;504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 106&#x96;107.  To reduce the workload of the Court of Appeals, a 1994 amendment to the Michigan Constitution changed the process for appeals following plea-based convictions.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 106&#x96;107.  As amended, the State Constitution provides: &#x93;In every criminal prosecution, the accused shall have the right &#x2026; to have an appeal as a matter of right, except as provided by law an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich. Const., Art. 1, &#xA7;20.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				A defendant convicted by plea who seeks review in the Michigan Court of Appeals must now file an application for leave to appeal pursuant to Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205 (2005).  In response, the Court of Appeals may, among other things, &#x93;grant or deny the application; enter a final decision; [or] grant other relief.&#x94;  Rule 7.205(D)(2).  If the court grants leave, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right.&#x94;  Rule 7.205(D)(3).  The parties agree that the Court of Appeals, in its orders denying properly filed applications for leave, uniformly cites &#x93;lack of merit in the grounds presented&#x94; as the basis for its decision.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 21&#x96;22, 24, 39.

				Under Michigan law, most indigent defendants convicted by plea must proceed 
				<em>
					pro se

				 in seeking leave to appeal.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000) provides, in relevant part, that a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence,&#x94; except that:

				  We hold that 
				<em>
					Douglas 
				</em>
				provides the controlling instruction.  Two aspects of the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; process following plea-based convictions lead us to that conclusion.  First, in determining how to dispose of an application for leave to appeal, Michigan&#x92;s intermediate appellate court looks to the merits of the claims made in the application.  Second, indigent defendants pursuing first-tier review in the Court of Appeals are generally ill equipped to represent themselves.

				A defendant who pleads guilty or 
				<em>
					nolo contendere 
				</em>
				in a Michigan court does not thereby forfeit all opportunity for appellate review.  Although he relinquishes access to an appeal as of right, he is entitled to apply for leave to appeal, and that entitlement is officially conveyed to him.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;5; Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(E)(2)(a) (2005) (&#x93;[T]he defendant is entitled to file an application for leave to appeal.&#x94;); see also Advice Concerning Right To Appeal, &#xB6;1, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 7, n. 1 (&#x93;You are entitled to file an application for leave to appeal with the Court of Appeals.&#x94;).  Of critical importance, the tribunal to which he addresses his application, the Michigan Court of Appeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court, sits as an error-correction instance.

				The Court of Appeals may respond to a leave application in a number of ways.  It &#x93;may grant or deny the application; enter a final decision; grant other relief; request additional material from the record; or require a certified concise statement of proceedings and facts from the court &#x2026; whose order is being appealed.&#x94;  Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(2) (2005).  When the court denies leave using the stock phrase &#x93;for lack of merit in the grounds presented,&#x94; its disposition may not be equivalent to a &#x93;final decision&#x94; on the merits, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the disposition may simply signal that the court found the matters asserted unworthy of the expenditure of further judicial resources.  But the court&#x92;s response to the leave application by any of the specified alternatives&#x97;including denial of leave&#x97;necessarily entails some evaluation of the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims.

				Michigan urges that review in the Court of Appeals following a plea-based conviction is as &#x93;discretionary&#x94; as review in the Michigan Supreme Court because both require an application for leave to appeal.  See

				  Therefore, Michigan maintains,

					e.g.

				, the involvement of a matter of &#x93;significant public interest.&#x94;  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4.  Michigan&#x92;s Supreme Court, too, sits not to correct errors in individual cases, but to decide matters of larger public import.  See Mich. Ct. Rule 7.302(B)(2)&#x96;(3) (2005) (criteria for granting leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court include whether a case presents an &#x93;issue [of] significant public interest&#x94; or &#x93;involves legal principles of major significance to the state&#x92;s jurisprudence&#x94;);

By contrast, the Michigan Court of Appeals, because it is an error-correction instance, is guided in responding to leave to appeal applications by the merits of the particular defendant&#x92;s claims, not by the general importance of the questions presented.

				Whether formally categorized as the decision of an appeal or the disposal of a leave application, the Court of Appeals&#x92; ruling on a plea-convicted defendant&#x92;s claims provides the first, and likely the only, direct review the defendant&#x92;s conviction and sentence will receive.  Parties like Halbert, however, are disarmed in their endeavor to gain first-tier review.  As the Court in 
				<em>
					Ross
				</em>
				 emphasized, a defendant seeking State Supreme Court review following a first-tier appeal as of right earlier had the assistance of appellate counsel.  The attorney appointed to serve at the intermediate appellate court level will have reviewed the trial court record, researched the legal issues, and prepared a brief reflecting that review and research.  417 U.

A first-tier review applicant, forced to act

						 Michigan provided Halbert with a form titled &#x93;Notice of Rights After Sentencing (After Plea of Guilty/Nolo Contendere) and Request for Appointment of Attorney.&#x94;  App. 46&#x96;50, 53&#x96;57.  Resembling the advice conveyed to Halbert by the trial judge, the form described the circumstances in which counsel must or may be appointed, but did not expressly state that, absent such circumstances, counsel would not be provided.  As revised, Michigan&#x92;s notice form now states: &#x93;You are not entitled to have a lawyer appointed at public expense to assist you in filing an application for leave to appeal &#x2026; .&#x94;  Advice Concerning Right To Appeal After Plea of Guilty/Nolo Contendere (rev. June 2004), available at http://courts.michigan.gov/scao/courtforms/appeals/cc265b.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 21, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).

						 The question at hand, all Members of the Court agree, is whether this case should be bracketed with Douglas v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/372/353" class="subref" title="subref">372 U. S. 353</a> (1963)
, because appointed counsel is sought for initial review before an intermediate appellate court, or with Ross v. Moffitt, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/600" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 600</a> (1974)
, because a plea-convicted defendant must file an application for leave to appeal.  See post, at 4 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (&#x93;Michigan&#x92;s system bears some similarity to the state systems at issue in both Douglas and Ross.&#x94;).

						 Both the majority and the dissent in People v. Bulger, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103 (2000), described the State&#x92;s intermediate appellate court&#x92;s function as error correction.  Compare id., at 516&#x96;518, 614 N. W. 2d, at 112&#x96;113 (in the majority&#x92;s view, the Court of Appeals could perform its review function, despite the defendant&#x92;s lack of representation, because plea-convicted defendants have ample aid for preservation of their claims in the trial court and ineffective assistance of counsel should be readily apparent to the Court of Appeals from the record), with id., at 543, 614 N. W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting) (&#x93;[T]he function of our Court of Appeals is reviewing the merits and correcting errors made by the lower courts.&#x94;).

						 The Bulger opinions nowhere describe the discretion exercised by the Michigan Court of Appeals as so unconstrained that it may &#x93;deny leave [to appeal] for any reason, or for no reason at all.&#x94;  Post, at 10 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Compare Bulger, 462 Mich., at 511, 614 N. W. 2d, at 110 (appeal to intermediate court is discretionary because a defendant must &#x93;obtai[n] leave&#x94;); id., at 506&#x96;508, 519, 614 N. W. 2d, at 108, 113, with id., at 542&#x96;543, 614 N. W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting) (Court of Appeals may deny leave to appeal where error is not outcome-determinative).

						 This assumes that trial counsel will recognize, in a postconviction motion, any issues appropriate for preservation for appellate review.  A lawyer may not, however, perceive his own errors or the need for such a motion.  Defense counsel here, for example, whose performance Halbert alleged to be ineffective, apparently did not assist Halbert in preparing and filing his motion to withdraw his plea.  See supra, at 8.

						 &#x93;No one questions,&#x94; the Bulger Court stated, &#x93;that the appointment of appellate counsel at state expense would be more efficient and helpful not only to defendants, but also to the appellate courts.&#x94;  462 Mich., at 520, 614 N. W. 2d, at 114.

						 Assuming, as Justice Thomas suggests, that whether Michigan law conferred on Halbert a post-plea right to appointed appellate counsel is irrelevant to whether Halbert waived a federal constitutional right to such counsel, post, at 16&#x96;17, the remainder of the dissent&#x92;s argument slips from my grasp, see post, at 17&#x96;18.  No conditional waiver&#x97;&#x93;on[e] in which a defendant agrees that, if he has &#x2026; a right, he waives it,&#x94; post, at 17&#x97;is at issue here.  Further, nothing in Halbert&#x92;s plea colloquy indicates that he waived an &#x93;unsettled,&#x94; but assumed, right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel, post-plea.  See post, at 17&#x96;18.

						 We are unpersuaded by the suggestion that, because a defendant may be able to waive his right to appeal entirely, Michigan can consequently exact from him a waiver of the right to government-funded appellate counsel.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 14.  Many legal rights are &#x93;presumptively waivable,&#x94; post, at 14 (Thomas, J., dissenting), and if Michigan were to require defendants to waive all forms of appeal as a condition of entering a plea, that condition would operate against moneyed and impoverished defendants alike.  A required waiver of the right to appointed counsel&#x92;s assistance when applying for leave to appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals, however, would accomplish the very result worked by Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000): It would leave indigents without access to counsel in that narrow range of circumstances in which, our decisions hold, the State must affirmatively ensure that poor defendants receive the legal assistance necessary to provide meaningful access to the judicial system.  See Douglas, 372 U. S., at 357&#x96;358; M. L. B., 519 U. S., at 110&#x96;113; cf. Griffin v. Illinois,

				In 1994, Michigan voters approved a proposal amending the State Constitution to provide that &#x93;an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich. Const., Art. 1, &#xA7;20.  Thereafter, &#x93;several Michigan state judges began to deny appointed appellate counsel to indigents&#x94; convicted by plea.

				Petitioner Antonio Dwayne Halbert, convicted on his plea of 
				<em>
					nolo contendere

				Michigan Court of Appeals review of an application for leave to appeal, Halbert contends, ranks as a first-tier appellate proceeding requiring appointment of counsel under

				<em>
					Kowalski
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Tesmer

				, this Court, for prudential reasons, declined to reach the classification question posed by Michigan&#x92;s system for appellate review following a plea of guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or 
				<em>
					nolo contendere
				</em>
				.  Today, we reach the classification question and conclude that Halbert&#x92;s case is properly ranked with 
				<em>
					Douglas 
				</em>
				rather than 
				<em>
					Ross
				</em>
				.  Accordingly, we hold that the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses require the appointment of counsel for defendants, convicted on their pleas, who seek access to first-tier review in the Michigan Court of Appeals.

				Two considerations were key to our decision in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 that a State is required to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant&#x92;s first-tier appeal as of right.  First, such an appeal entails an adjudication on the &#x93;merits.&#x94;  372 U. S., at 357.  Second, first-tier review differs from subsequent appellate stages &#x93;at which the claims have once been presented by [appellate counsel] and passed upon by an appellate court.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 356.  Under the California system at issue in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, the first-tier appellate court independently examined the record to determine whether to appoint counsel.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 355.  When a defendant able to retain counsel pursued an appeal, the 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 Court observed, &#x93;the appellate court passe[d] on the merits of [the] case only after having the full benefit of written briefs and oral argument by counsel.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 356.  In contrast, when a poor person appealed, &#x93;the appellate court [wa]s forced to prejudge the merits [of the case] before it c[ould] even determine whether counsel should be provided.&#x94;  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				In Ross
				, we explained why the rationale of 
				<em>
					Douglas 
				</em>
				did not extend to the appointment of counsel for an indigent seeking to pursue a second-tier discretionary appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court or, thereafter, certiorari review in this Court.  The North Carolina Supreme Court, in common with this Court we perceived, does not sit as an error-correction instance.  417 U. S., at 615.  Principal criteria for state high court review, we noted, included &#x93;whether the subject matter of the appeal has significant public interest, whether the cause involves legal principles of major significance to the jurisprudence of the State, [and] whether the decision below is in probable conflict&#x94; with the court&#x92;s precedent.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Further, we pointed out, a defendant who had already benefited from counsel&#x92;s aid in a first-tier appeal as of right would have, &#x93;at the very least, a transcript or other record of trial proceedings, a brief on his behalf in the Court of Appeals setting forth his claims of error, and in many cases an opinion by the Court of Appeals disposing of his case.&#x94;  Ibid.

				Michigan has a two-tier appellate system comprising the State Supreme Court and the intermediate Court of Appeals.  The Michigan Supreme Court hears appeals by leave only.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3(6) (West Supp. 2004).  Prior to 1994, the Court of Appeals adjudicated appeals as of right from all criminal convictions.  
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich., at 503&#x96;504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 106&#x96;107.  To reduce the workload of the Court of Appeals, a 1994 amendment to the Michigan Constitution changed the process for appeals following plea-based convictions.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 106&#x96;107.  As amended, the State Constitution provides: &#x93;In every criminal prosecution, the accused shall have the right &#x2026; to have an appeal as a matter of right, except as provided by law an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich. Const., Art. 1, &#xA7;20.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				A defendant convicted by plea who seeks review in the Michigan Court of Appeals must now file an application for leave to appeal pursuant to Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205 (2005).  In response, the Court of Appeals may, among other things, &#x93;grant or deny the application; enter a final decision; [or] grant other relief.&#x94;  Rule 7.205(D)(2).  If the court grants leave, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right.&#x94;  Rule 7.205(D)(3).  The parties agree that the Court of Appeals, in its orders denying properly filed applications for leave, uniformly cites &#x93;lack of merit in the grounds presented&#x94; as the basis for its decision.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 21&#x96;22, 24, 39.

				Under Michigan law, most indigent defendants convicted by plea must proceed 
				<em>
					pro se

				 in seeking leave to appeal.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000) provides, in relevant part, that a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence,&#x94; except that:

				Petitioner Halbert&#x92;s case is framed by two prior decisions of this Court concerning state-funded appellate counsel, 
				<em>

				  We hold that 
				<em>
					Douglas 
				</em>
				provides the controlling instruction.  Two aspects of the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; process following plea-based convictions lead us to that conclusion.  First, in determining how to dispose of an application for leave to appeal, Michigan&#x92;s intermediate appellate court looks to the merits of the claims made in the application.  Second, indigent defendants pursuing first-tier review in the Court of Appeals are generally ill equipped to represent themselves.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				A defendant who pleads guilty or 
				<em>
					nolo contendere 
				</em>
				in a Michigan court does not thereby forfeit all opportunity for appellate review.  Although he relinquishes access to an appeal as of right, he is entitled to apply for leave to appeal, and that entitlement is officially conveyed to him.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;5; Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(E)(2)(a) (2005) (&#x93;[T]he defendant is entitled to file an application for leave to appeal.&#x94;); see also Advice Concerning Right To Appeal, &#xB6;1, 
				<em>
					supra,
				</em>
				 at 7, n. 1 (&#x93;You are entitled to file an application for leave to appeal with the Court of Appeals.&#x94;).  Of critical importance, the tribunal to which he addresses his application, the Michigan Court of Appeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court, sits as an error-correction instance.

				The Court of Appeals may respond to a leave application in a number of ways.  It &#x93;may grant or deny the application; enter a final decision; grant other relief; request additional material from the record; or require a certified concise statement of proceedings and facts from the court &#x2026; whose order is being appealed.&#x94;  Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(2) (2005).  When the court denies leave using the stock phrase &#x93;for lack of merit in the grounds presented,&#x94; its disposition may not be equivalent to a &#x93;final decision&#x94; on the merits, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the disposition may simply signal that the court found the matters asserted unworthy of the expenditure of further judicial resources.  But the court&#x92;s response to the leave application by any of the specified alternatives&#x97;including denial of leave&#x97;necessarily entails some evaluation of the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims.

				Michigan urges that review in the Court of Appeals following a plea-based conviction is as &#x93;discretionary&#x94; as review in the Michigan Supreme Court because both require an application for leave to appeal.  See

				  Therefore, Michigan maintains,

				<em>

				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, the involvement of a matter of &#x93;significant public interest.&#x94;  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4.  Michigan&#x92;s Supreme Court, too, sits not to correct errors in individual cases, but to decide matters of larger public import.  See Mich. Ct. Rule 7.302(B)(2)&#x96;(3) (2005) (criteria for granting leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court include whether a case presents an &#x93;issue [of] significant public interest&#x94; or &#x93;involves legal principles of major significance to the state&#x92;s jurisprudence&#x94;);

By contrast, the Michigan Court of Appeals, because it is an error-correction instance, is guided in responding to leave to appeal applications by the merits of the particular defendant&#x92;s claims, not by the general importance of the questions presented.

				Whether formally categorized as the decision of an appeal or the disposal of a leave application, the Court of Appeals&#x92; ruling on a plea-convicted defendant&#x92;s claims provides the first, and likely the only, direct review the defendant&#x92;s conviction and sentence will receive.  Parties like Halbert, however, are disarmed in their endeavor to gain first-tier review.  As the Court in 
				<em>
					Ross
				</em>
				 emphasized, a defendant seeking State Supreme Court review following a first-tier appeal as of right earlier had the assistance of appellate counsel.  The attorney appointed to serve at the intermediate appellate court level will have reviewed the trial court record, researched the legal issues, and prepared a brief reflecting that review and research.  417 U. S., at 615.  The defendant seeking second-tier review may also be armed with an opinion of the intermediate appellate court addressing the issues counsel raised.  A first-tier review applicant, forced to act 
				<em>
					pro se
				</em>
				, will face a record unreviewed by appellate counsel, and will be equipped with no attorney&#x92;s brief prepared for, or reasoned opinion by, a court of review.

						 The question at hand, all Members of the Court agree, is whether this case should be bracketed with Douglas v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/372/353" class="subref" title="subref">372 U. S. 353</a> (1963)
, because appointed counsel is sought for initial review before an intermediate appellate court, or with Ross v. Moffitt, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/417/600" class="subref" title="subref">417 U. S. 600</a> (1974)

						 Both the majority and the dissent in People v. Bulger, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103 (2000), described the State&#x92;s intermediate appellate court&#x92;s function as error correction.  Compare id., at 516&#x96;518, 614 N. W. 2d, at 112&#x96;113 (in the majority&#x92;s view, the Court of Appeals could perform its review function, despite the defendant&#x92;s lack of representation, because plea-convicted defendants have ample aid for preservation of their claims in the trial court and ineffective assistance of counsel should be readily apparent to the Court of Appeals from the record), with id., at 543, 614 N. W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting) (&#x93;[T]he function of our Court of Appeals is reviewing the merits and correcting errors made by the lower courts.&#x94;).

						 The Bulger opinions nowhere describe the discretion exercised by the Michigan Court of Appeals as so unconstrained that it may &#x93;deny leave [to appeal] for any reason, or for no reason at all.&#x94;  Post, at 10 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Compare Bulger, 462 Mich., at 511, 614 N. W. 2d, at 110 (appeal to intermediate court is discretionary because a defendant must &#x93;obtai[n] leave&#x94;); id., at 506&#x96;508, 519, 614 N.

						 This assumes that trial counsel will recognize, in a postconviction motion, any issues appropriate for preservation for appellate review.  A lawyer may not, however, perceive his own errors or the need for such a motion.  Defense counsel here, for example, whose performance Halbert alleged to be ineffective, apparently did not assist Halbert in preparing and filing his motion to withdraw his plea.  See supra, at 8.

						 Assuming, as Justice Thomas suggests, that whether Michigan law conferred on Halbert a post-plea right to appointed appellate counsel is irrelevant to whether Halbert waived a federal constitutional right to such counsel, post, at 16&#x96;17, the remainder of the dissent&#x92;s argument slips from my grasp, see post, at 17&#x96;18.  No conditional waiver&#x97;&#x93;on[e] in which a defendant agrees that, if he has &#x2026; a right, he waives it,&#x94; post, at 17&#x97;is at issue here.  Further, nothing in Halbert&#x92;s plea colloquy indicates that he waived an &#x93;unsettled,&#x94; but assumed, right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel, post-plea.  See post, at 17&#x96;18.

						 We are unpersuaded by the suggestion that, because a defendant may be able to waive his right to appeal entirely, Michigan can consequently exact from him a waiver of the right to government-funded appellate counsel.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 14.  Many legal rights are &#x93;presumptively waivable,&#x94; post, at 14 (Thomas, J., dissenting), and if Michigan were to require defendants to waive all forms of appeal as a condition of entering a plea, that condition would operate against moneyed and impoverished defendants alike.  A required waiver of the right to appointed counsel&#x92;s assistance when applying for leave to appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals, however, would accomplish the very result worked by Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000): It would leave indigents without access to counsel in that narrow range of circumstances in which, our decisions hold, the State must affirmatively ensure that poor defendants receive the legal assistance necessary to provide meaningful access to the judicial system.

				Two considerations were key to our decision in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 that a State is required to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant&#x92;s first-tier appeal as of right.  First, such an appeal entails an adjudication on the &#x93;merits.&#x94;  372 U. S., at 357.  Second, first-tier review differs from subsequent appellate stages &#x93;at which the claims have once been presented by [appellate counsel] and passed upon by an appellate court.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 356.  Under the California system at issue in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, the first-tier appellate court independently examined the record to determine whether to appoint counsel.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 355.  When a defendant able to retain counsel pursued an appeal, the 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 Court observed, &#x93;the appellate court passe[d] on the merits of [the] case only after having the full benefit of written briefs and oral argument by counsel.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 356.  In contrast, when a poor person appealed, &#x93;the appellate court [wa]s forced to prejudge the merits [of the case] before it c[ould] even determine whether counsel should be provided.&#x94;  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				In Ross
				, we explained why the rationale of 
				<em>
					Douglas 
				</em>
				did not extend to the appointment of counsel for an indigent seeking to pursue a second-tier discretionary appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court or, thereafter, certiorari review in this Court.  The North Carolina Supreme Court, in common with this Court we perceived, does not sit as an error-correction instance.  417 U. S., at 615.  Principal criteria for state high court review, we noted, included &#x93;whether the subject matter of the appeal has significant public interest, whether the cause involves legal principles of major significance to the jurisprudence of the State, [and] whether the decision below is in probable conflict&#x94; with the court&#x92;s precedent.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Further, we pointed out, a defendant who had already benefited from counsel&#x92;s aid in a first-tier appeal as of right would have, &#x93;at the very least, a transcript or other record of trial proceedings, a brief on his behalf in the Court of Appeals setting forth his claims of error, and in many cases an opinion by the Court of Appeals disposing of his case.&#x94;  Ibid.

				Michigan has a two-tier appellate system comprising the State Supreme Court and the intermediate Court of Appeals.  The Michigan Supreme Court hears appeals by leave only.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3(6) (West Supp. 2004).  Prior to 1994, the Court of Appeals adjudicated appeals as of right from all criminal convictions.

				, 462 Mich., at 503&#x96;504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 106&#x96;107.  To reduce the workload of the Court of Appeals, a 1994 amendment to the Michigan Constitution changed the process for appeals following plea-based convictions.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 106&#x96;107.  As amended, the State Constitution provides: &#x93;In every criminal prosecution, the accused shall have the right &#x2026; to have an appeal as a matter of right, except as provided by law an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich. Const., Art. 1, &#xA7;20.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				A defendant convicted by plea who seeks review in the Michigan Court of Appeals must now file an application for leave to appeal pursuant to Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205 (2005).  In response, the Court of Appeals may, among other things, &#x93;grant or deny the application; enter a final decision; [or] grant other relief.&#x94;  Rule 7.205(D)(2).  If the court grants leave, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right.&#x94;  Rule 7.205(D)(3).  The parties agree that the Court of Appeals, in its orders denying properly filed applications for leave, uniformly cites &#x93;lack of merit in the grounds presented&#x94; as the basis for its decision.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 21&#x96;22, 24, 39.

				Under Michigan law, most indigent defendants convicted by plea must proceed 
				<em>

Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000) provides, in relevant part, that a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence,&#x94; except that:

				  We hold that 
				<em>
					Douglas 
				</em>
				provides the controlling instruction.  Two aspects of the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; process following plea-based convictions lead us to that conclusion.  First, in determining how to dispose of an application for leave to appeal, Michigan&#x92;s intermediate appellate court looks to the merits of the claims made in the application.  Second, indigent defendants pursuing first-tier review in the Court of Appeals are generally ill equipped to represent themselves.

				A defendant who pleads guilty or 
				<em>
					nolo contendere 
				</em>
				in a Michigan court does not thereby forfeit all opportunity for appellate review.  Although he relinquishes access to an appeal as of right, he is entitled to apply for leave to appeal, and that entitlement is officially conveyed to him.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;5; Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(E)(2)(a) (2005) (&#x93;[T]he defendant is entitled to file an application for leave to appeal.&#x94;); see also Advice Concerning Right To Appeal, &#xB6;1, 
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 7, n. 1 (&#x93;You are entitled to file an application for leave to appeal with the Court of Appeals.&#x94;).  Of critical importance, the tribunal to which he addresses his application, the Michigan Court of Appeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court, sits as an error-correction instance.

				The Court of Appeals may respond to a leave application in a number of ways.  It &#x93;may grant or deny the application; enter a final decision; grant other relief; request additional material from the record; or require a certified concise statement of proceedings and facts from the court &#x2026; whose order is being appealed.&#x94;  Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(2) (2005).  When the court denies leave using the stock phrase &#x93;for lack of merit in the grounds presented,&#x94; its disposition may not be equivalent to a &#x93;final decision&#x94; on the merits, 
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, the disposition may simply signal that the court found the matters asserted unworthy of the expenditure of further judicial resources.  But the court&#x92;s response to the leave application by any of the specified alternatives&#x97;including denial of leave&#x97;necessarily entails some evaluation of the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims.

				Michigan urges that review in the Court of Appeals following a plea-based conviction is as &#x93;discretionary&#x94; as review in the Michigan Supreme Court because both require an application for leave to appeal.  See

				  Therefore, Michigan maintains,

				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, the involvement of a matter of &#x93;significant public interest.&#x94;  See 
				<em>
					supra

				, at 4.  Michigan&#x92;s Supreme Court, too, sits not to correct errors in individual cases, but to decide matters of larger public import.  See Mich. Ct. Rule 7.302(B)(2)&#x96;(3) (2005) (criteria for granting leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court include whether a case presents an &#x93;issue [of] significant public interest&#x94; or &#x93;involves legal principles of major significance to the state&#x92;s jurisprudence&#x94;);

By contrast, the Michigan Court of Appeals, because it is an error-correction instance, is guided in responding to leave to appeal applications by the merits of the particular defendant&#x92;s claims, not by the general importance of the questions presented.

				Whether formally categorized as the decision of an appeal or the disposal of a leave application, the Court of Appeals&#x92; ruling on a plea-convicted defendant&#x92;s claims provides the first, and likely the only, direct review the defendant&#x92;s conviction and sentence will receive.  Parties like Halbert, however, are disarmed in their endeavor to gain first-tier review.  As the Court in 
				<em>
					Ross
				</em>
				 emphasized, a defendant seeking State Supreme Court review following a first-tier appeal as of right earlier had the assistance of appellate counsel.  The attorney appointed to serve at the intermediate appellate court level will have reviewed the trial court record, researched the legal issues, and prepared a brief reflecting that review and research.  417 U.

A first-tier review applicant, forced to act

				</em>
				, will face a record unreviewed by appellate counsel, and will be equipped with no attorney&#x92;s brief prepared for, or reasoned opinion by, a court of review.

						 Both the majority and the dissent in People v. Bulger, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103 (2000), described the State&#x92;s intermediate appellate court&#x92;s function as error correction.  Compare id., at 516&#x96;518, 614 N. W. 2d, at 112&#x96;113 (in the majority&#x92;s view, the Court of Appeals could perform its review function, despite the defendant&#x92;s lack of representation, because plea-convicted defendants have ample aid for preservation of their claims in the trial court and ineffective assistance of counsel should be readily apparent to the Court of Appeals from the record), with id., at 543, 614 N. W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting) (&#x93;[T]he function of our Court of Appeals is reviewing the merits and correcting errors made by the lower courts.&#x94;).

						 The Bulger opinions nowhere describe the discretion exercised by the Michigan Court of Appeals as so unconstrained that it may &#x93;deny leave [to appeal] for any reason, or for no reason at all.&#x94;  Post, at 10 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Compare Bulger, 462 Mich., at 511, 614 N. W. 2d, at 110 (appeal to intermediate court is discretionary because a defendant must &#x93;obtai[n] leave&#x94;); id., at 506&#x96;508, 519, 614 N.

						 This assumes that trial counsel will recognize, in a postconviction motion, any issues appropriate for preservation for appellate review.  A lawyer may not, however, perceive his own errors or the need for such a motion.  Defense counsel here, for example, whose performance Halbert alleged to be ineffective, apparently did not assist Halbert in preparing and filing his motion to withdraw his plea.  See supra, at 8.

						 &#x93;No one questions,&#x94; the Bulger Court stated, &#x93;that the appointment of appellate counsel at state expense would be more efficient and helpful not only to defendants, but also to the appellate courts.&#x94;  462 Mich., at 520, 614 N. W. 2d, at 114.

						 Assuming, as Justice Thomas suggests, that whether Michigan law conferred on Halbert a post-plea right to appointed appellate counsel is irrelevant to whether Halbert waived a federal constitutional right to such counsel, post, at 16&#x96;17, the remainder of the dissent&#x92;s argument slips from my grasp, see post, at 17&#x96;18.  No conditional waiver&#x97;&#x93;on[e] in which a defendant agrees that, if he has &#x2026; a right, he waives it,&#x94; post, at 17&#x97;is at issue here.  Further, nothing in Halbert&#x92;s plea colloquy indicates that he waived an &#x93;unsettled,&#x94; but assumed, right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel, post-plea.  See post, at 17&#x96;18.

						 We are unpersuaded by the suggestion that, because a defendant may be able to waive his right to appeal entirely, Michigan can consequently exact from him a waiver of the right to government-funded appellate counsel.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 14.  Many legal rights are &#x93;presumptively waivable,&#x94; post, at 14 (Thomas, J., dissenting), and if Michigan were to require defendants to waive all forms of appeal as a condition of entering a plea, that condition would operate against moneyed and impoverished defendants alike.  A required waiver of the right to appointed counsel&#x92;s assistance when applying for leave to appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals, however, would accomplish the very result worked by Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000): It would leave indigents without access to counsel in that narrow range of circumstances in which, our decisions hold, the State must affirmatively ensure that poor defendants receive the legal assistance necessary to provide meaningful access to the judicial system.

				Two considerations were key to our decision in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 that a State is required to appoint counsel for an indigent defendant&#x92;s first-tier appeal as of right.  First, such an appeal entails an adjudication on the &#x93;merits.&#x94;  372 U. S., at 357.  Second, first-tier review differs from subsequent appellate stages &#x93;at which the claims have once been presented by [appellate counsel] and passed upon by an appellate court.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 356.  Under the California system at issue in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, the first-tier appellate court independently examined the record to determine whether to appoint counsel.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 355.  When a defendant able to retain counsel pursued an appeal, the 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 Court observed, &#x93;the appellate court passe[d] on the merits of [the] case only after having the full benefit of written briefs and oral argument by counsel.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 356.  In contrast, when a poor person appealed, &#x93;the appellate court [wa]s forced to prejudge the merits [of the case] before it c[ould] even determine whether counsel should be provided.&#x94;  Ibid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				In Ross
				, we explained why the rationale of 
				<em>
					Douglas 
				</em>
				did not extend to the appointment of counsel for an indigent seeking to pursue a second-tier discretionary appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court or, thereafter, certiorari review in this Court.  The North Carolina Supreme Court, in common with this Court we perceived, does not sit as an error-correction instance.  417 U. S., at 615.  Principal criteria for state high court review, we noted, included &#x93;whether the subject matter of the appeal has significant public interest, whether the cause involves legal principles of major significance to the jurisprudence of the State, [and] whether the decision below is in probable conflict&#x94; with the court&#x92;s precedent.  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Further, we pointed out, a defendant who had already benefited from counsel&#x92;s aid in a first-tier appeal as of right would have, &#x93;at the very least, a transcript or other record of trial proceedings, a brief on his behalf in the Court of Appeals setting forth his claims of error, and in many cases an opinion by the Court of Appeals disposing of his case.&#x94;  Ibid.

				Michigan has a two-tier appellate system comprising the State Supreme Court and the intermediate Court of Appeals.  The Michigan Supreme Court hears appeals by leave only.  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3(6) (West Supp. 2004).  Prior to 1994, the Court of Appeals adjudicated appeals as of right from all criminal convictions.

				, 462 Mich., at 503&#x96;504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 106&#x96;107.  To reduce the workload of the Court of Appeals, a 1994 amendment to the Michigan Constitution changed the process for appeals following plea-based convictions.  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 106&#x96;107.  As amended, the State Constitution provides: &#x93;In every criminal prosecution, the accused shall have the right &#x2026; to have an appeal as a matter of right, except as provided by law an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich. Const., Art. 1, &#xA7;20.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				A defendant convicted by plea who seeks review in the Michigan Court of Appeals must now file an application for leave to appeal pursuant to Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205 (2005).  In response, the Court of Appeals may, among other things, &#x93;grant or deny the application; enter a final decision; [or] grant other relief.&#x94;  Rule 7.205(D)(2).  If the court grants leave, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right.&#x94;  Rule 7.205(D)(3).  The parties agree that the Court of Appeals, in its orders denying properly filed applications for leave, uniformly cites &#x93;lack of merit in the grounds presented&#x94; as the basis for its decision.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 21&#x96;22, 24, 39.

				Under Michigan law, most indigent defendants convicted by plea must proceed 
				<em>

Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000) provides, in relevant part, that a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence,&#x94; except that:

				  We hold that 
				<em>
					Douglas

				provides the controlling instruction.  Two aspects of the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; process following plea-based convictions lead us to that conclusion.  First, in determining how to dispose of an application for leave to appeal, Michigan&#x92;s intermediate appellate court looks to the merits of the claims made in the application.  Second, indigent defendants pursuing first-tier review in the Court of Appeals are generally ill equipped to represent themselves.

				A defendant who pleads guilty or 
				<em>
					nolo contendere 
				</em>
				in a Michigan court does not thereby forfeit all opportunity for appellate review.  Although he relinquishes access to an appeal as of right, he is entitled to apply for leave to appeal, and that entitlement is officially conveyed to him.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;5; Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(E)(2)(a) (2005) (&#x93;[T]he defendant is entitled to file an application for leave to appeal.&#x94;); see also Advice Concerning Right To Appeal, &#xB6;1,

				 at 7, n. 1 (&#x93;You are entitled to file an application for leave to appeal with the Court of Appeals.&#x94;).  Of critical importance, the tribunal to which he addresses his application, the Michigan Court of Appeals, unlike the Michigan Supreme Court, sits as an error-correction instance.

				The Court of Appeals may respond to a leave application in a number of ways.  It &#x93;may grant or deny the application; enter a final decision; grant other relief; request additional material from the record; or require a certified concise statement of proceedings and facts from the court &#x2026; whose order is being appealed.&#x94;  Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(2) (2005).  When the court denies leave using the stock phrase &#x93;for lack of merit in the grounds presented,&#x94; its disposition may not be equivalent to a &#x93;final decision&#x94; on the merits, 
				<em>
					i.e.

				, the disposition may simply signal that the court found the matters asserted unworthy of the expenditure of further judicial resources.

				  Therefore, Michigan maintains,

				, the involvement of a matter of &#x93;significant public interest.&#x94;  See 
				<em>

Rule 7.302(B)(2)&#x96;(3) (2005) (criteria for granting leave to appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court include whether a case presents an &#x93;issue [of] significant public interest&#x94; or &#x93;involves legal principles of major significance to the state&#x92;s jurisprudence&#x94;);

By contrast, the Michigan Court of Appeals, because it is an error-correction instance, is guided in responding to leave to appeal applications by the merits of the particular defendant&#x92;s claims, not by the general importance of the questions presented.

				Whether formally categorized as the decision of an appeal or the disposal of a leave application, the Court of Appeals&#x92; ruling on a plea-convicted defendant&#x92;s claims provides the first, and likely the only, direct review the defendant&#x92;s conviction and sentence will receive.  Parties like Halbert, however, are disarmed in their endeavor to gain first-tier review.  As the Court in 
				<em>
					Ross
				</em>
				 emphasized, a defendant seeking State Supreme Court review following a first-tier appeal as of right earlier had the assistance of appellate counsel.  The attorney appointed to serve at the intermediate appellate court level will have reviewed the trial court record, researched the legal issues, and prepared a brief reflecting that review and research.  417 U.

A first-tier review applicant, forced to act

						 This assumes that trial counsel will recognize, in a postconviction motion, any issues appropriate for preservation for appellate review.  A lawyer may not, however, perceive his own errors or the need for such a motion.  Defense counsel here, for example, whose performance Halbert alleged to be ineffective, apparently did not assist Halbert in preparing and filing his motion to withdraw his plea.  See supra, at 8.

						 Assuming, as Justice Thomas suggests, that whether Michigan law conferred on Halbert a post-plea right to appointed appellate counsel is irrelevant to whether Halbert waived a federal constitutional right to such counsel, post, at 16&#x96;17, the remainder of the dissent&#x92;s argument slips from my grasp, see post, at 17&#x96;18.  No conditional waiver&#x97;&#x93;on[e] in which a defendant agrees that, if he has &#x2026; a right, he waives it,&#x94; post, at 17&#x97;is at issue here.  Further, nothing in Halbert&#x92;s plea colloquy indicates that he waived an &#x93;unsettled,&#x94; but assumed, right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel, post-plea.  See post, at 17&#x96;18.

						 We are unpersuaded by the suggestion that, because a defendant may be able to waive his right to appeal entirely, Michigan can consequently exact from him a waiver of the right to government-funded appellate counsel.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 14.  Many legal rights are &#x93;presumptively waivable,&#x94; post, at 14 (Thomas, J., dissenting), and if Michigan were to require defendants to waive all forms of appeal as a condition of entering a plea, that condition would operate against moneyed and impoverished defendants alike.  A required waiver of the right to appointed counsel&#x92;s assistance when applying for leave to appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals, however, would accomplish the very result worked by Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000): It would leave indigents without access to counsel in that narrow range of circumstances in which, our decisions hold, the State must affirmatively ensure that poor defendants receive the legal assistance necessary to provide meaningful access to the judicial system.

Michigan law did not provide Halbert&#x97;as a defendant convicted by a plea of guilty or no contest&#x97;an appointed attorney to help him prepare an application for leave to appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  The Court holds Michigan&#x92;s law unconstitutional as applied to Halbert.

				To understand why the Court&#x92;s holding is an unwarranted extension of our precedents, it is necessary first to understand the limits that Michigan places on the provision of court-appointed counsel for defendants who plead guilty or no contest.  Before 1994, Michigan afforded all criminal defendants the right to appeal their convictions to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  By the early 1990&#x92;s, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals had a backlog of thousands of cases awaiting decision, nearly a third of which were appeals by defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.

				, 462 Mich. 495, 504, 614 N. W. 2d 103, 107 (2000).  To reduce this backlog, Michigan voters amended the Michigan Constitution in 1994 to provide that &#x93;[i]n every criminal prosecution, the accused shall &#x2026; have an appeal as a matter of right, except [that] &#x2026; an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich.

				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 107.  This constitutional amendment created a two-track system for Michigan defendants: The Michigan Court of Appeals must hear the appeals of those who dispute their guilt, while it may elect to hear the appeals of those who concede or do not contest their guilt of the substantive crime.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In 1999, the Michigan Legislature enacted the statute at issue here.  It provides that, in general, a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence.&#x94;  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(1) (West 2000).  Defendants who plead guilty or no contest do not, however, invariably lose the right to counsel on appeal; the statute contains exceptions to the general rule.  The trial court must appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants if the State seeks leave to appeal, the defendant&#x92;s sentence exceeds the upper limit of the applicable minimum guidelines range, or the defendant seeks leave to appeal a conditional plea.  &#xA7;770.3a(2).  Further, the trial court may appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants who seek leave to appeal certain sentencing errors.  &#xA7;770.3a(3).  Finally, if the Court of Appeals grants leave to appeal, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right,&#x94; Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(3) (2005), and the plea-convicted defendant is entitled to appointed counsel, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Thus, plea-convicted defendants lack appellate counsel only in certain types of cases, and only then when they are seeking leave to appeal.

It finds that all plea-convicted indigent defendants have the right to appellate counsel when seeking leave to appeal.

Michigan has done no more than recognize the undeniable difference between defendants who plead guilty and those who maintain their innocence, in an attempt to divert resources from largely frivolous appeals to more meritorious ones.

				Far from being an &#x93;arbitrary&#x94; or &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; distinction, Michigan&#x92;s differentiation between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea is sensible.  First and perhaps foremost, the danger of wrongful convictions is less significant than in 
				<em>
					Douglas

				.  In 
				<em>
					Douglas

				, California preliminarily denied counsel to all indigent defendants, regardless of whether they maintained their innocence at trial or conceded their guilt by plea.

        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[p]lea proceedings are also shorter, simpler, and more routine than trials; the record most often consists of the &#x91;factual basis&#x92; for the plea that is provided to the trial court.

When a defendant pleads in open court, there is less need for counsel to develop the record and refine claims to present to an appellate court.  These are all &#x93; &#x91;[r]easoned distinctions&#x92; &#x94; between defendants convicted by trial and those convicted by their own plea.

				The brief history of Michigan&#x92;s system confirms this.  When Michigan voters amended the State Constitution to establish the current system, roughly 13,000 civil and criminal appeals per year clogged the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; docket.  Of those, nearly a third were appeals by criminal defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.  Even though at the time plea-convicted defendants were appointed paid appellate counsel, few of these defendants were granted relief on appeal.  Simply put, Michigan&#x92;s bar and bench were devoting a substantial portion of their scarce resources to thousands of cases with little practical effect.  Reallocating resources was not &#x93;invidious discrimination&#x94; against criminal defendants, indigent or otherwise.

				Today&#x92;s decision will therefore do no favors for indigent defendants in Michigan&#x97;at least, indigent defendants with nonfrivolous claims.  While defendants who admit their guilt will receive more attention, defendants who maintain their innocence will receive less.  Even some defendants who plead guilty will feel the pinch, because plea-convicted defendants are entitled to counsel in preparing their leave applications if, for example, they appeal from conditional pleas, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(d) (2005), or their sentences exceed the applicable guidelines ranges, &#xA7;770.3a(2)(b).  And any plea-convicted defendant granted leave to appeal is entitled to appointed counsel.  &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Holding Michigan&#x92;s resources constant (since we have no control over the State&#x92;s bar or budget), the majority&#x92;s policy choice to redistribute the State&#x92;s limited resources only harms those most likely to have worthwhile claims&#x97;to say nothing of &#x93;the cost of enabling courts and prosecutors to respond to the &#x91;over-lawyering&#x92; of minor cases.&#x94;

				The majority does not attempt to demonstrate that Michigan&#x92;s system is the sort of &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; discrimination against indigent defendants 
				<em>
					Douglas

				<em>
					Douglas:
				</em>
				 First, when a plea-convicted defendant seeks leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals adjudicates the leave application with reference to the merits.

				The majority reasons that in adjudicating an application for leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals &#x93;is guided &#x2026; by the merits of the particular defendant&#x92;s claims.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The distinction that 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 drew, however, was not between appellate systems that involve &#x93;some evaluation of the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; and those that do not, 
				<em>
					ante

				, at 10, but instead between discretionary and mandatory review.  
				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				 evaluated cases on their merits: These courts were hearing appeals as of right.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Michigan Court of Appeals probably does consider &#x93;the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; in exercising its discretion; so do other courts of discretionary review, including this Court.  For instance, this Court would be unlikely to grant a case to announce a rule that could not alter the case&#x92;s disposition, or to correct an error that had not affected the proceedings below.  This Court often considers whether errors are worth correcting in both plenary and summary dispositions.  None of this converts discretionary, error-noticing review into mandatory, error-correcting review.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Likewise, the Michigan Court of Appeals is not required to hear particular cases or correct particular errors.  It may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition questionable or dubious.  Or it may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition important or interesting.  For all we know, it may (and probably does) consider both.  Regardless, the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant review remains &#x93;discretionary,&#x94; because it does not depend on &#x93;whether there has been &#x91;a correct adjudication of guilt&#x92; in every individual case.&#x94;

				The majority appears to dispute that review before the Michigan Court of Appeals is truly discretionary,

				<em>
					Bulger

				<em>

				, at 542&#x96;543, 614 N. W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting) (&#x93;Nothing in our court rules or statute precludes the Court of Appeals from denying leave even though it may believe that the trial court&#x92;s decision was incorrect&#x94;).  So far as we can tell, the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant or deny a leave application is not constrained by any state constitutional provision, statute, or court rule.  The Michigan Court of Appeals may deny leave for any reason, or for no reason at all.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The majority claims that &#x93;[a]t the time he entered his plea, Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel he could elect to forgo.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  This assertion apparently refers to the Michigan statute, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000).  At the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, the statute provided that, if a defendant was convicted by plea, he generally could not receive appointed appellate counsel.  The majority&#x92;s reasoning is flawed for at least three reasons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the statement that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, is either incorrect or irrelevant.  If (as we must) we view the waiver decision from the perspective of Halbert and other defendants 
				<em>
					before entering a plea
				</em>
				, the statement is wrong as a matter of Michigan law.  The Michigan Court Rules applicable at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea explicitly provided that he was entitled to appointed appellate counsel if convicted following a trial.  Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(F)(1)(b) (Lexis 2001) (&#x93;In a case involving a conviction following a trial, if the defendant is indigent, the court must enter an order appointing a lawyer if the request is filed within 42 days after sentencing or within the time for filing an appeal of right&#x94;).  Michigan law thus gave Halbert, before entering a plea, the choice either to proceed to trial and guarantee himself appointed appellate counsel, or to plead guilty or no contest and forgo appointed appellate counsel in most circumstances.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Alternately, by stating that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, the majority might mean that Michigan law afforded Halbert no right to appointed appellate counsel following a plea-based conviction.  If so, the statement is true but irrelevant.  Of course Michigan law did not afford Halbert a right to appointed counsel once he pleaded no contest to the charged crimes.  But the question is whether, by pleading no contest with knowledge of the condition (no paid counsel on appeal), Halbert accepted the condition and thereby waived his right to paid counsel on appeal.  In other words, the question is whether Halbert had no right to counsel following his plea, because he had elected to forgo the right 
				<em>
					by pleading
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even if the majority were correct about Michigan law, that is beside the point.  At issue here is whether Halbert waived any federal constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				right to appointed appellate counsel he might have enjoyed.  Whether Michigan law provides for such counsel says nothing about whether a defendant possesses (and hence can waive) a federal constitutional right to that effect.  That Michigan, as a matter of state law, prohibited Halbert from receiving appointed appellate counsel if he pleaded guilty or no contest, is irrelevant to whether Halbert had (and could waive) an independent federal constitutional right to such counsel.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the majority implies that if the existence of a right to paid appellate counsel had been something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized&#x94; at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, then the right would have been waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  What this cryptic statement means is unclear.  But it cannot possibly mean that only rights that have been explicitly and uniformly recognized by statute or case law may be waived.  If that is what the statement means, then the majority has outlawed all conditional waivers (ones in which a defendant agrees that, if he has such a right, he waives it).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I take it instead that the reference to rights that are something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized,&#x94; and hence waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, means not just rights that are uniformly recognized, but also rights whose existence is unsettled.  If this understanding of the majority&#x92;s rule is correct, then the rule does not justify its claim that the constitutional right at issue was wholly unrecognized.  In fact, the existence of such a right was unsettled when Halbert entered his plea.  By that date, November 7, 2001, the Michigan Supreme Court had issued

				To understand why the Court&#x92;s holding is an unwarranted extension of our precedents, it is necessary first to understand the limits that Michigan places on the provision of court-appointed counsel for defendants who plead guilty or no contest.  Before 1994, Michigan afforded all criminal defendants the right to appeal their convictions to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  By the early 1990&#x92;s, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals had a backlog of thousands of cases awaiting decision, nearly a third of which were appeals by defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.

				 v. 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 504, 614 N. W. 2d 103, 107 (2000).  To reduce this backlog, Michigan voters amended the Michigan Constitution in 1994 to provide that &#x93;[i]n every criminal prosecution, the accused shall &#x2026; have an appeal as a matter of right, except [that] &#x2026; an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich. Const., Art. 1, &#xA7;20; 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 107.  This constitutional amendment created a two-track system for Michigan defendants: The Michigan Court of Appeals must hear the appeals of those who dispute their guilt, while it may elect to hear the appeals of those who concede or do not contest their guilt of the substantive crime.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In 1999, the Michigan Legislature enacted the statute at issue here.  It provides that, in general, a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence.&#x94;  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(1) (West 2000).  Defendants who plead guilty or no contest do not, however, invariably lose the right to counsel on appeal; the statute contains exceptions to the general rule.  The trial court must appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants if the State seeks leave to appeal, the defendant&#x92;s sentence exceeds the upper limit of the applicable minimum guidelines range, or the defendant seeks leave to appeal a conditional plea.  &#xA7;770.3a(2).  Further, the trial court may appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants who seek leave to appeal certain sentencing errors.  &#xA7;770.3a(3).  Finally, if the Court of Appeals grants leave to appeal, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right,&#x94; Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(3) (2005), and the plea-convicted defendant is entitled to appointed counsel, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Thus, plea-convicted defendants lack appellate counsel only in certain types of cases, and only then when they are seeking leave to appeal.

				The majority nevertheless holds that Michigan&#x92;s system is constitutionally inadequate.  It finds that all plea-convicted indigent defendants have the right to appellate counsel when seeking leave to appeal.

				<em>

				 condemns.  Michigan has done no more than recognize the undeniable difference between defendants who plead guilty and those who maintain their innocence, in an attempt to divert resources from largely frivolous appeals to more meritorious ones.

				Far from being an &#x93;arbitrary&#x94; or &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; distinction, Michigan&#x92;s differentiation between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea is sensible.  First and perhaps foremost, the danger of wrongful convictions is less significant than in

				The brief history of Michigan&#x92;s system confirms this.  When Michigan voters amended the State Constitution to establish the current system, roughly 13,000 civil and criminal appeals per year clogged the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; docket.  Of those, nearly a third were appeals by criminal defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.  Even though at the time plea-convicted defendants were appointed paid appellate counsel, few of these defendants were granted relief on appeal.  Simply put, Michigan&#x92;s bar and bench were devoting a substantial portion of their scarce resources to thousands of cases with little practical effect.  Reallocating resources was not &#x93;invidious discrimination&#x94; against criminal defendants, indigent or otherwise.

				Today&#x92;s decision will therefore do no favors for indigent defendants in Michigan&#x97;at least, indigent defendants with nonfrivolous claims.  While defendants who admit their guilt will receive more attention, defendants who maintain their innocence will receive less.  Even some defendants who plead guilty will feel the pinch, because plea-convicted defendants are entitled to counsel in preparing their leave applications if, for example, they appeal from conditional pleas, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(d) (2005), or their sentences exceed the applicable guidelines ranges, &#xA7;770.3a(2)(b).  And any plea-convicted defendant granted leave to appeal is entitled to appointed counsel.  &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Holding Michigan&#x92;s resources constant (since we have no control over the State&#x92;s bar or budget), the majority&#x92;s policy choice to redistribute the State&#x92;s limited resources only harms those most likely to have worthwhile claims&#x97;to say nothing of &#x93;the cost of enabling courts and prosecutors to respond to the &#x91;over-lawyering&#x92; of minor cases.&#x94;

				<em>
					Ante

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Michigan Court of Appeals probably does consider &#x93;the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; in exercising its discretion; so do other courts of discretionary review, including this Court.  For instance, this Court would be unlikely to grant a case to announce a rule that could not alter the case&#x92;s disposition, or to correct an error that had not affected the proceedings below.  This Court often considers whether errors are worth correcting in both plenary and summary dispositions.  None of this converts discretionary, error-noticing review into mandatory, error-correcting review.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Likewise, the Michigan Court of Appeals is not required to hear particular cases or correct particular errors.  It may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition questionable or dubious.  Or it may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition important or interesting.  For all we know, it may (and probably does) consider both.  Regardless, the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant review remains &#x93;discretionary,&#x94; because it does not depend on &#x93;whether there has been &#x91;a correct adjudication of guilt&#x92; in every individual case.&#x94;

				The majority appears to dispute that review before the Michigan Court of Appeals is truly discretionary,

So far as we can tell, the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant or deny a leave application is not constrained by any state constitutional provision, statute, or court rule.  The Michigan Court of Appeals may deny leave for any reason, or for no reason at all.

				The majority maintains, first, that Halbert could not waive the right to appointed appellate counsel because Michigan law afforded him no such right to waive; second, in dictum, that the right cannot be waived; and, third, that even if the right can be waived, Halbert did not knowingly and intelligently waive it here.  The Court is wrong in each respect.

				The majority claims that &#x93;[a]t the time he entered his plea, Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel he could elect to forgo.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  This assertion apparently refers to the Michigan statute, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000).  At the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, the statute provided that, if a defendant was convicted by plea, he generally could not receive appointed appellate counsel.  The majority&#x92;s reasoning is flawed for at least three reasons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the statement that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, is either incorrect or irrelevant.  If (as we must) we view the waiver decision from the perspective of Halbert and other defendants 
				<em>
					before entering a plea
				</em>
				, the statement is wrong as a matter of Michigan law.  The Michigan Court Rules applicable at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea explicitly provided that he was entitled to appointed appellate counsel if convicted following a trial.  Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(F)(1)(b) (Lexis 2001) (&#x93;In a case involving a conviction following a trial, if the defendant is indigent, the court must enter an order appointing a lawyer if the request is filed within 42 days after sentencing or within the time for filing an appeal of right&#x94;).  Michigan law thus gave Halbert, before entering a plea, the choice either to proceed to trial and guarantee himself appointed appellate counsel, or to plead guilty or no contest and forgo appointed appellate counsel in most circumstances.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Alternately, by stating that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, the majority might mean that Michigan law afforded Halbert no right to appointed appellate counsel following a plea-based conviction.  If so, the statement is true but irrelevant.  Of course Michigan law did not afford Halbert a right to appointed counsel once he pleaded no contest to the charged crimes.  But the question is whether, by pleading no contest with knowledge of the condition (no paid counsel on appeal), Halbert accepted the condition and thereby waived his right to paid counsel on appeal.  In other words, the question is whether Halbert had no right to counsel following his plea, because he had elected to forgo the right 
				<em>
					by pleading
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even if the majority were correct about Michigan law, that is beside the point.  At issue here is whether Halbert waived any federal constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				right to appointed appellate counsel he might have enjoyed.  Whether Michigan law provides for such counsel says nothing about whether a defendant possesses (and hence can waive) a federal constitutional right to that effect.  That Michigan, as a matter of state law, prohibited Halbert from receiving appointed appellate counsel if he pleaded guilty or no contest, is irrelevant to whether Halbert had (and could waive) an independent federal constitutional right to such counsel.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the majority implies that if the existence of a right to paid appellate counsel had been something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized&#x94; at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, then the right would have been waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  What this cryptic statement means is unclear.  But it cannot possibly mean that only rights that have been explicitly and uniformly recognized by statute or case law may be waived.  If that is what the statement means, then the majority has outlawed all conditional waivers (ones in which a defendant agrees that, if he has such a right, he waives it).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I take it instead that the reference to rights that are something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized,&#x94; and hence waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, means not just rights that are uniformly recognized, but also rights whose existence is unsettled.  If this understanding of the majority&#x92;s rule is correct, then the rule does not justify its claim that the constitutional right at issue was wholly unrecognized.  In fact, the existence of such a right was unsettled when Halbert entered his plea.  By that date, November 7, 2001, the Michigan Supreme Court had issued 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103, sustaining over a vigorous dissent the practice of denying the appointment of appellate counsel on application for leave to appeal a plea-based conviction; and a Federal District Court had enjoined Michigan state judges from denying the appointment of appellate counsel to indigents pursuant to the state statute, on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional, 
				<em>
					Tesmer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Kowalski
				</em>
				, 114 F. Supp. 2d 622, 625&#x96;629 (ED Mich. 2000).  The majority appears to focus on the fact that Michigan law did not afford defendants this right, but, again, state law is irrelevant to whether they possessed a federal constitutional right.  The existence of that right was unsettled
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea; hence, on what I take to
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				be the majority&#x92;s own terms, the right should have been waivable.

				The majority attempts to deflect this criticism by saying that &#x93;nothing in Halbert&#x92;s plea colloquy indicates that he waived an &#x91;unsettled&#x92; &#x2026; but assumed right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel, post-plea.&#x94;  
				<em>

				, at 16, n. 7.  But any arguable inadequacy in the plea colloquy is a separate issue from, and is irrelevant to, the question at hand: whether the right was recognized, and hence waivable by Halbert (or any other defendant deciding how to plead), irrespective of the content of the plea colloquy.

				<em>

				In this case, the plea colloquy shows that Halbert&#x92;s waiver was knowing and intelligent, and that any deficiency in the plea colloquy was harmless.  See

First, Halbert understood he was waiving any appeal as of right: The trial court asked Halbert, &#x93;You understand if I accept your plea you are giving up or waiving any claim of an appeal as of right,&#x94; and Halbert answered &#x93;Yes, sir.&#x94;  App. 22.  Second, the court explained the statutory exceptions governing when counsel must or might be appointed, and Halbert again indicated that he understood those conditions.

In context, the court&#x92;s enumeration of the limited conditions in which counsel might be appointed informed Halbert that counsel would not be appointed in other circumstances.  Third, at the end of the colloquy, the court asked counsel, &#x93;Any other promises or considerations I should be made aware of?&#x94; App. 24, and &#x93;Do counsel believe I&#x92;ve complied with the court rule regarding no contest pleas?&#x94;

				To understand why the Court&#x92;s holding is an unwarranted extension of our precedents, it is necessary first to understand the limits that Michigan places on the provision of court-appointed counsel for defendants who plead guilty or no contest.  Before 1994, Michigan afforded all criminal defendants the right to appeal their convictions to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  By the early 1990&#x92;s, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals had a backlog of thousands of cases awaiting decision, nearly a third of which were appeals by defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.

				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 504, 614 N. W. 2d 103, 107 (2000).  To reduce this backlog, Michigan voters amended the Michigan Constitution in 1994 to provide that &#x93;[i]n every criminal prosecution, the accused shall &#x2026; have an appeal as a matter of right, except [that] &#x2026; an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich.

				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 107.  This constitutional amendment created a two-track system for Michigan defendants: The Michigan Court of Appeals must hear the appeals of those who dispute their guilt, while it may elect to hear the appeals of those who concede or do not contest their guilt of the substantive crime.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In 1999, the Michigan Legislature enacted the statute at issue here.  It provides that, in general, a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence.&#x94;  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(1) (West 2000).  Defendants who plead guilty or no contest do not, however, invariably lose the right to counsel on appeal; the statute contains exceptions to the general rule.  The trial court must appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants if the State seeks leave to appeal, the defendant&#x92;s sentence exceeds the upper limit of the applicable minimum guidelines range, or the defendant seeks leave to appeal a conditional plea.  &#xA7;770.3a(2).  Further, the trial court may appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants who seek leave to appeal certain sentencing errors.  &#xA7;770.3a(3).  Finally, if the Court of Appeals grants leave to appeal, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right,&#x94; Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(3) (2005), and the plea-convicted defendant is entitled to appointed counsel, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Thus, plea-convicted defendants lack appellate counsel only in certain types of cases, and only then when they are seeking leave to appeal.

				The majority nevertheless holds that Michigan&#x92;s system is constitutionally inadequate.  It finds that all plea-convicted indigent defendants have the right to appellate counsel when seeking leave to appeal.

				Far from being an &#x93;arbitrary&#x94; or &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; distinction, Michigan&#x92;s differentiation between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea is sensible.  First and perhaps foremost, the danger of wrongful convictions is less significant than in 
				<em>
					Douglas

				.  In 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[p]lea proceedings are also shorter, simpler, and more routine than trials; the record most often consists of the &#x91;factual basis&#x92; for the plea that is provided to the trial court.

When a defendant pleads in open court, there is less need for counsel to develop the record and refine claims to present to an appellate court.  These are all &#x93; &#x91;[r]easoned distinctions&#x92; &#x94; between defendants convicted by trial and those convicted by their own plea.

				The brief history of Michigan&#x92;s system confirms this.  When Michigan voters amended the State Constitution to establish the current system, roughly 13,000 civil and criminal appeals per year clogged the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; docket.  Of those, nearly a third were appeals by criminal defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.  Even though at the time plea-convicted defendants were appointed paid appellate counsel, few of these defendants were granted relief on appeal.  Simply put, Michigan&#x92;s bar and bench were devoting a substantial portion of their scarce resources to thousands of cases with little practical effect.  Reallocating resources was not &#x93;invidious discrimination&#x94; against criminal defendants, indigent or otherwise.  
				<em>

				Today&#x92;s decision will therefore do no favors for indigent defendants in Michigan&#x97;at least, indigent defendants with nonfrivolous claims.  While defendants who admit their guilt will receive more attention, defendants who maintain their innocence will receive less.  Even some defendants who plead guilty will feel the pinch, because plea-convicted defendants are entitled to counsel in preparing their leave applications if, for example, they appeal from conditional pleas, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(d) (2005), or their sentences exceed the applicable guidelines ranges, &#xA7;770.3a(2)(b).  And any plea-convicted defendant granted leave to appeal is entitled to appointed counsel.  &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Holding Michigan&#x92;s resources constant (since we have no control over the State&#x92;s bar or budget), the majority&#x92;s policy choice to redistribute the State&#x92;s limited resources only harms those most likely to have worthwhile claims&#x97;to say nothing of &#x93;the cost of enabling courts and prosecutors to respond to the &#x91;over-lawyering&#x92; of minor cases.&#x94;

				The majority does not attempt to demonstrate that Michigan&#x92;s system is the sort of &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; discrimination against indigent defendants 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 prohibits.  Instead, the majority says that this case is earmarked by two considerations that were also key to this Court&#x92;s decision in 
				<em>
					Douglas:
				</em>
				 First, when a plea-convicted defendant seeks leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals adjudicates the leave application with reference to the merits.  
				<em>

				.  Neither of these arguments is correct.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				1
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The majority reasons that in adjudicating an application for leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals &#x93;is guided &#x2026; by the merits of the particular defendant&#x92;s claims.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The distinction that 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 drew, however, was not between appellate systems that involve &#x93;some evaluation of the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; and those that do not, 
				<em>

				, at 10, but instead between discretionary and mandatory review.  
				<em>
					Supra
				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;6.  Of course the California intermediate courts in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 evaluated cases on their merits: These courts were hearing appeals as of right.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Michigan Court of Appeals probably does consider &#x93;the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; in exercising its discretion; so do other courts of discretionary review, including this Court.  For instance, this Court would be unlikely to grant a case to announce a rule that could not alter the case&#x92;s disposition, or to correct an error that had not affected the proceedings below.  This Court often considers whether errors are worth correcting in both plenary and summary dispositions.  None of this converts discretionary, error-noticing review into mandatory, error-correcting review.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Likewise, the Michigan Court of Appeals is not required to hear particular cases or correct particular errors.  It may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition questionable or dubious.  Or it may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition important or interesting.  For all we know, it may (and probably does) consider both.  Regardless, the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant review remains &#x93;discretionary,&#x94; because it does not depend on &#x93;whether there has been &#x91;a correct adjudication of guilt&#x92; in every individual case.&#x94;  
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority appears to dispute that review before the Michigan Court of Appeals is truly discretionary, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10&#x96;11, and n. 4, but it provides no support for its speculation.  Unlike the California District Court of Appeal in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, the Michigan Court of Appeals has discretion in deciding whether to grant leave applications.  See 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich., at 519, 614 N. W. 2d, at 113 (describing the issue as &#x93;whether a defendant is entitled under the federal constitution to appointed counsel in a first

				</em>
				 appeal from a plea-based conviction&#x94; (emphasis in original)); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 542&#x96;543, 614 N. W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting) (&#x93;Nothing in our court rules or statute precludes the Court of Appeals from denying leave even though it may believe that the trial court&#x92;s decision was incorrect&#x94;).  So far as we can tell, the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant or deny a leave application is not constrained by any state constitutional provision, statute, or court rule.  The Michigan Court of Appeals may deny leave for any reason, or for no reason at all.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority&#x92;s holding suggests that Michigan&#x92;s system would pass constitutional muster if the Court of Appeals recited &#x93;lack of importance in the grounds presented&#x94; as its ground for denying leave, 
				<em>
					ante

				This is in part why this Court in

				 did not extend the right to counsel to discretionary review before the North Carolina Supreme Court.  Before that court, a defendant applying for leave had &#x93;a transcript or other record of trial proceedings, a brief on his behalf in the Court of Appeals setting forth his claims of error, and in many cases an opinion by the Court of Appeals disposing of his case.&#x94;

				Lacking support in this Court&#x92;s cases, the majority effects a not-so-subtle shift from whether the record is adequate to enable discretionary review to whether plea-convicted defendants are generally able to &#x93;[n]aviga[te] the appellate process without a lawyer&#x92;s assistance.&#x94;

				The majority maintains, first, that Halbert could not waive the right to appointed appellate counsel because Michigan law afforded him no such right to waive; second, in dictum, that the right cannot be waived; and, third, that even if the right can be waived, Halbert did not knowingly and intelligently waive it here.  The Court is wrong in each respect.

        <p class="opcentered">

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The majority claims that &#x93;[a]t the time he entered his plea, Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel he could elect to forgo.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  This assertion apparently refers to the Michigan statute, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000).  At the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, the statute provided that, if a defendant was convicted by plea, he generally could not receive appointed appellate counsel.  The majority&#x92;s reasoning is flawed for at least three reasons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the statement that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, is either incorrect or irrelevant.  If (as we must) we view the waiver decision from the perspective of Halbert and other defendants 
				<em>
					before entering a plea
				</em>
				, the statement is wrong as a matter of Michigan law.  The Michigan Court Rules applicable at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea explicitly provided that he was entitled to appointed appellate counsel if convicted following a trial.  Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(F)(1)(b) (Lexis 2001) (&#x93;In a case involving a conviction following a trial, if the defendant is indigent, the court must enter an order appointing a lawyer if the request is filed within 42 days after sentencing or within the time for filing an appeal of right&#x94;).  Michigan law thus gave Halbert, before entering a plea, the choice either to proceed to trial and guarantee himself appointed appellate counsel, or to plead guilty or no contest and forgo appointed appellate counsel in most circumstances.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Alternately, by stating that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, the majority might mean that Michigan law afforded Halbert no right to appointed appellate counsel following a plea-based conviction.  If so, the statement is true but irrelevant.  Of course Michigan law did not afford Halbert a right to appointed counsel once he pleaded no contest to the charged crimes.  But the question is whether, by pleading no contest with knowledge of the condition (no paid counsel on appeal), Halbert accepted the condition and thereby waived his right to paid counsel on appeal.  In other words, the question is whether Halbert had no right to counsel following his plea, because he had elected to forgo the right 
				<em>
					by pleading
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even if the majority were correct about Michigan law, that is beside the point.  At issue here is whether Halbert waived any federal constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				right to appointed appellate counsel he might have enjoyed.  Whether Michigan law provides for such counsel says nothing about whether a defendant possesses (and hence can waive) a federal constitutional right to that effect.  That Michigan, as a matter of state law, prohibited Halbert from receiving appointed appellate counsel if he pleaded guilty or no contest, is irrelevant to whether Halbert had (and could waive) an independent federal constitutional right to such counsel.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the majority implies that if the existence of a right to paid appellate counsel had been something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized&#x94; at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, then the right would have been waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  What this cryptic statement means is unclear.  But it cannot possibly mean that only rights that have been explicitly and uniformly recognized by statute or case law may be waived.  If that is what the statement means, then the majority has outlawed all conditional waivers (ones in which a defendant agrees that, if he has such a right, he waives it).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I take it instead that the reference to rights that are something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized,&#x94; and hence waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, means not just rights that are uniformly recognized, but also rights whose existence is unsettled.  If this understanding of the majority&#x92;s rule is correct, then the rule does not justify its claim that the constitutional right at issue was wholly unrecognized.  In fact, the existence of such a right was unsettled when Halbert entered his plea.  By that date, November 7, 2001, the Michigan Supreme Court had issued 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103, sustaining over a vigorous dissent the practice of denying the appointment of appellate counsel on application for leave to appeal a plea-based conviction; and a Federal District Court had enjoined Michigan state judges from denying the appointment of appellate counsel to indigents pursuant to the state statute, on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional, 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Kowalski
				</em>
				, 114 F. Supp. 2d 622, 625&#x96;629 (ED Mich. 2000).  The majority appears to focus on the fact that Michigan law did not afford defendants this right, but, again, state law is irrelevant to whether they possessed a federal constitutional right.  The existence of that right was unsettled
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea; hence, on what I take to
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				be the majority&#x92;s own terms, the right should have been waivable.

				The majority attempts to deflect this criticism by saying that &#x93;nothing in Halbert&#x92;s plea colloquy indicates that he waived an &#x91;unsettled&#x92; &#x2026; but assumed right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel, post-plea.&#x94;  
				<em>

				, at 16, n. 7.  But any arguable inadequacy in the plea colloquy is a separate issue from, and is irrelevant to, the question at hand: whether the right was recognized, and hence waivable by Halbert (or any other defendant deciding how to plead), irrespective of the content of the plea colloquy.

				<em>

				To understand why the Court&#x92;s holding is an unwarranted extension of our precedents, it is necessary first to understand the limits that Michigan places on the provision of court-appointed counsel for defendants who plead guilty or no contest.  Before 1994, Michigan afforded all criminal defendants the right to appeal their convictions to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  By the early 1990&#x92;s, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals had a backlog of thousands of cases awaiting decision, nearly a third of which were appeals by defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.

				, 462 Mich. 495, 504, 614 N. W. 2d 103, 107 (2000).  To reduce this backlog, Michigan voters amended the Michigan Constitution in 1994 to provide that &#x93;[i]n every criminal prosecution, the accused shall &#x2026; have an appeal as a matter of right, except [that] &#x2026; an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich.

				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 107.  This constitutional amendment created a two-track system for Michigan defendants: The Michigan Court of Appeals must hear the appeals of those who dispute their guilt, while it may elect to hear the appeals of those who concede or do not contest their guilt of the substantive crime.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In 1999, the Michigan Legislature enacted the statute at issue here.  It provides that, in general, a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence.&#x94;  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(1) (West 2000).  Defendants who plead guilty or no contest do not, however, invariably lose the right to counsel on appeal; the statute contains exceptions to the general rule.  The trial court must appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants if the State seeks leave to appeal, the defendant&#x92;s sentence exceeds the upper limit of the applicable minimum guidelines range, or the defendant seeks leave to appeal a conditional plea.  &#xA7;770.3a(2).  Further, the trial court may appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants who seek leave to appeal certain sentencing errors.  &#xA7;770.3a(3).  Finally, if the Court of Appeals grants leave to appeal, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right,&#x94; Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(3) (2005), and the plea-convicted defendant is entitled to appointed counsel, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Thus, plea-convicted defendants lack appellate counsel only in certain types of cases, and only then when they are seeking leave to appeal.

				The majority nevertheless holds that Michigan&#x92;s system is constitutionally inadequate.

				Far from being an &#x93;arbitrary&#x94; or &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; distinction, Michigan&#x92;s differentiation between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea is sensible.  First and perhaps foremost, the danger of wrongful convictions is less significant than in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				.  In 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, California preliminarily denied counsel to all indigent defendants, regardless of whether they maintained their innocence at trial or conceded their guilt by plea.  Here, Michigan preliminarily denies paid counsel only to indigent defendants who admit or do not contest their guilt.

        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[p]lea proceedings are also shorter, simpler, and more routine than trials; the record most often consists of the &#x91;factual basis&#x92; for the plea that is provided to the trial court.  In contrast with trials, less danger exists in plea cases that the record will be so unclear, or the errors so hidden, that the defendant&#x92;s appeal will be reduced to a meaningless ritual.&#x94;

When a defendant pleads in open court, there is less need for counsel to develop the record and refine claims to present to an appellate court.  These are all &#x93; &#x91;[r]easoned distinctions&#x92; &#x94; between defendants convicted by trial and those convicted by their own plea.

				The brief history of Michigan&#x92;s system confirms this.  When Michigan voters amended the State Constitution to establish the current system, roughly 13,000 civil and criminal appeals per year clogged the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; docket.  Of those, nearly a third were appeals by criminal defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.  Even though at the time plea-convicted defendants were appointed paid appellate counsel, few of these defendants were granted relief on appeal.  Simply put, Michigan&#x92;s bar and bench were devoting a substantial portion of their scarce resources to thousands of cases with little practical effect.  Reallocating resources was not &#x93;invidious discrimination&#x94; against criminal defendants, indigent or otherwise.

				Today&#x92;s decision will therefore do no favors for indigent defendants in Michigan&#x97;at least, indigent defendants with nonfrivolous claims.  While defendants who admit their guilt will receive more attention, defendants who maintain their innocence will receive less.  Even some defendants who plead guilty will feel the pinch, because plea-convicted defendants are entitled to counsel in preparing their leave applications if, for example, they appeal from conditional pleas, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(d) (2005), or their sentences exceed the applicable guidelines ranges, &#xA7;770.3a(2)(b).  And any plea-convicted defendant granted leave to appeal is entitled to appointed counsel.  &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Holding Michigan&#x92;s resources constant (since we have no control over the State&#x92;s bar or budget), the majority&#x92;s policy choice to redistribute the State&#x92;s limited resources only harms those most likely to have worthwhile claims&#x97;to say nothing of &#x93;the cost of enabling courts and prosecutors to respond to the &#x91;over-lawyering&#x92; of minor cases.&#x94;

				The majority does not attempt to demonstrate that Michigan&#x92;s system is the sort of &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; discrimination against indigent defendants 
				<em>

				<em>
					Douglas:
				</em>
				 First, when a plea-convicted defendant seeks leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals adjudicates the leave application with reference to the merits.

			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				1
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The majority reasons that in adjudicating an application for leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals &#x93;is guided &#x2026; by the merits of the particular defendant&#x92;s claims.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The distinction that 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 drew, however, was not between appellate systems that involve &#x93;some evaluation of the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; and those that do not, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>

				<em>

				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 evaluated cases on their merits: These courts were hearing appeals as of right.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Michigan Court of Appeals probably does consider &#x93;the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; in exercising its discretion; so do other courts of discretionary review, including this Court.  For instance, this Court would be unlikely to grant a case to announce a rule that could not alter the case&#x92;s disposition, or to correct an error that had not affected the proceedings below.  This Court often considers whether errors are worth correcting in both plenary and summary dispositions.  None of this converts discretionary, error-noticing review into mandatory, error-correcting review.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Likewise, the Michigan Court of Appeals is not required to hear particular cases or correct particular errors.  It may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition questionable or dubious.  Or it may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition important or interesting.  For all we know, it may (and probably does) consider both.  Regardless, the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant review remains &#x93;discretionary,&#x94; because it does not depend on &#x93;whether there has been &#x91;a correct adjudication of guilt&#x92; in every individual case.&#x94;  
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority appears to dispute that review before the Michigan Court of Appeals is truly discretionary, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10&#x96;11, and n. 4, but it provides no support for its speculation.  Unlike the California District Court of Appeal in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, the Michigan Court of Appeals has discretion in deciding whether to grant leave applications.  See 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich., at 519, 614 N. W. 2d, at 113 (describing the issue as &#x93;whether a defendant is entitled under the federal constitution to appointed counsel in a first 
				<em>
					discretionary
				</em>
				 appeal from a plea-based conviction&#x94; (emphasis in original)); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 542&#x96;543, 614 N. W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting) (&#x93;Nothing in our court rules or statute precludes the Court of Appeals from denying leave even though it may believe that the trial court&#x92;s decision was incorrect&#x94;).  So far as we can tell, the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant or deny a leave application is not constrained by any state constitutional provision, statute, or court rule.  The Michigan Court of Appeals may deny leave for any reason, or for no reason at all.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority&#x92;s holding suggests that Michigan&#x92;s system would pass constitutional muster if the Court of Appeals recited &#x93;lack of importance in the grounds presented&#x94; as its ground for denying leave, 
				<em>
					ante

And  even assuming the Michigan courts have special difficulty, it is unlikely any marginal gains will offset the harms wrought by the majority&#x92;s preference for redistributing resources to a set of generally less meritorious claims.  Whether or not one agrees with the policy choice made by Michigan voters, it is perfectly constitutional.

				The majority maintains, first, that Halbert could not waive the right to appointed appellate counsel because Michigan law afforded him no such right to waive; second, in dictum, that the right cannot be waived; and, third, that even if the right can be waived, Halbert did not knowingly and intelligently waive it here.  The Court is wrong in each respect.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The majority claims that &#x93;[a]t the time he entered his plea, Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel he could elect to forgo.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  This assertion apparently refers to the Michigan statute, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000).  At the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, the statute provided that, if a defendant was convicted by plea, he generally could not receive appointed appellate counsel.  The majority&#x92;s reasoning is flawed for at least three reasons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the statement that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, is either incorrect or irrelevant.  If (as we must) we view the waiver decision from the perspective of Halbert and other defendants 
				<em>
					before entering a plea
				</em>
				, the statement is wrong as a matter of Michigan law.  The Michigan Court Rules applicable at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea explicitly provided that he was entitled to appointed appellate counsel if convicted following a trial.  Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(F)(1)(b) (Lexis 2001) (&#x93;In a case involving a conviction following a trial, if the defendant is indigent, the court must enter an order appointing a lawyer if the request is filed within 42 days after sentencing or within the time for filing an appeal of right&#x94;).  Michigan law thus gave Halbert, before entering a plea, the choice either to proceed to trial and guarantee himself appointed appellate counsel, or to plead guilty or no contest and forgo appointed appellate counsel in most circumstances.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Alternately, by stating that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, the majority might mean that Michigan law afforded Halbert no right to appointed appellate counsel following a plea-based conviction.  If so, the statement is true but irrelevant.  Of course Michigan law did not afford Halbert a right to appointed counsel once he pleaded no contest to the charged crimes.  But the question is whether, by pleading no contest with knowledge of the condition (no paid counsel on appeal), Halbert accepted the condition and thereby waived his right to paid counsel on appeal.  In other words, the question is whether Halbert had no right to counsel following his plea, because he had elected to forgo the right 
				<em>
					by pleading
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even if the majority were correct about Michigan law, that is beside the point.  At issue here is whether Halbert waived any federal constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				right to appointed appellate counsel he might have enjoyed.  Whether Michigan law provides for such counsel says nothing about whether a defendant possesses (and hence can waive) a federal constitutional right to that effect.  That Michigan, as a matter of state law, prohibited Halbert from receiving appointed appellate counsel if he pleaded guilty or no contest, is irrelevant to whether Halbert had (and could waive) an independent federal constitutional right to such counsel.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the majority implies that if the existence of a right to paid appellate counsel had been something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized&#x94; at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, then the right would have been waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  What this cryptic statement means is unclear.  But it cannot possibly mean that only rights that have been explicitly and uniformly recognized by statute or case law may be waived.  If that is what the statement means, then the majority has outlawed all conditional waivers (ones in which a defendant agrees that, if he has such a right, he waives it).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I take it instead that the reference to rights that are something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized,&#x94; and hence waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, means not just rights that are uniformly recognized, but also rights whose existence is unsettled.  If this understanding of the majority&#x92;s rule is correct, then the rule does not justify its claim that the constitutional right at issue was wholly unrecognized.  In fact, the existence of such a right was unsettled when Halbert entered his plea.  By that date, November 7, 2001, the Michigan Supreme Court had issued 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103, sustaining over a vigorous dissent the practice of denying the appointment of appellate counsel on application for leave to appeal a plea-based conviction; and a Federal District Court had enjoined Michigan state judges from denying the appointment of appellate counsel to indigents pursuant to the state statute, on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional, 
				<em>
					Tesmer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Kowalski
				</em>
				, 114 F. Supp. 2d 622, 625&#x96;629 (ED Mich. 2000).  The majority appears to focus on the fact that Michigan law did not afford defendants this right, but, again, state law is irrelevant to whether they possessed a federal constitutional right.  The existence of that right was unsettled
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea; hence, on what I take to
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				be the majority&#x92;s own terms, the right should have been waivable.

				The majority attempts to deflect this criticism by saying that &#x93;nothing in Halbert&#x92;s plea colloquy indicates that he waived an &#x91;unsettled&#x92; &#x2026; but assumed right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel, post-plea.&#x94;  
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 16, n. 7.  But any arguable inadequacy in the plea colloquy is a separate issue from, and is irrelevant to, the question at hand: whether the right was recognized, and hence waivable by Halbert (or any other defendant deciding how to plead), irrespective of the content of the plea colloquy.

				<em>
					Mezzanatto, supra,

				 at 200.  For the proposition that Michigan&#x92;s waiver requirement is unconstitutional, the majority cites

Second, the court explained the statutory exceptions governing when counsel must or might be appointed, and Halbert again indicated that he understood those conditions.

In context, the court&#x92;s enumeration of the limited conditions in which counsel might be appointed informed Halbert that counsel would not be appointed in other circumstances.  Third, at the end of the colloquy, the court asked counsel, &#x93;Any other promises or considerations I should be made aware of?&#x94; App. 24, and &#x93;Do counsel believe I&#x92;ve complied with the court rule regarding no contest pleas?&#x94;

				Petitioner Antonio Halbert pleaded no contest to charges that he sexually assaulted his stepdaughter and another young girl.  Michigan law did not provide Halbert&#x97;as a defendant convicted by a plea of guilty or no contest&#x97;an appointed attorney to help him prepare an application for leave to appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  The Court holds Michigan&#x92;s law unconstitutional as applied to Halbert.  It fails, however, to ground its analysis in any particular provision of the Constitution or in this Court&#x92;s precedents.  It also ignores that, even if there is a right to counsel in the circumstances at issue, the right is waivable and was validly waived here.  I respectfully dissent.

				To understand why the Court&#x92;s holding is an unwarranted extension of our precedents, it is necessary first to understand the limits that Michigan places on the provision of court-appointed counsel for defendants who plead guilty or no contest.  Before 1994, Michigan afforded all criminal defendants the right to appeal their convictions to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  By the early 1990&#x92;s, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals had a backlog of thousands of cases awaiting decision, nearly a third of which were appeals by defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.

				, 462 Mich. 495, 504, 614 N. W. 2d 103, 107 (2000).  To reduce this backlog, Michigan voters amended the Michigan Constitution in 1994 to provide that &#x93;[i]n every criminal prosecution, the accused shall &#x2026; have an appeal as a matter of right, except [that] &#x2026; an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich.

				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 107.  This constitutional amendment created a two-track system for Michigan defendants: The Michigan Court of Appeals must hear the appeals of those who dispute their guilt, while it may elect to hear the appeals of those who concede or do not contest their guilt of the substantive crime.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In 1999, the Michigan Legislature enacted the statute at issue here.  It provides that, in general, a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence.&#x94;  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(1) (West 2000).  Defendants who plead guilty or no contest do not, however, invariably lose the right to counsel on appeal; the statute contains exceptions to the general rule.  The trial court must appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants if the State seeks leave to appeal, the defendant&#x92;s sentence exceeds the upper limit of the applicable minimum guidelines range, or the defendant seeks leave to appeal a conditional plea.  &#xA7;770.3a(2).  Further, the trial court may appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants who seek leave to appeal certain sentencing errors.  &#xA7;770.3a(3).  Finally, if the Court of Appeals grants leave to appeal, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right,&#x94; Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(3) (2005), and the plea-convicted defendant is entitled to appointed counsel, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Thus, plea-convicted defendants lack appellate counsel only in certain types of cases, and only then when they are seeking leave to appeal.

				The majority nevertheless holds that Michigan&#x92;s system is constitutionally inadequate.  It finds that all plea-convicted indigent defendants have the right to appellate counsel when seeking leave to appeal.

				Far from being an &#x93;arbitrary&#x94; or &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; distinction, Michigan&#x92;s differentiation between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea is sensible.  First and perhaps foremost, the danger of wrongful convictions is less significant than in 
				<em>
					Douglas

				.  In 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, California preliminarily denied counsel to all indigent defendants, regardless of whether they maintained their innocence at trial or conceded their guilt by plea.  Here, Michigan preliminarily denies paid counsel only to indigent defendants who admit or do not contest their guilt.

        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[p]lea proceedings are also shorter, simpler, and more routine than trials; the record most often consists of the &#x91;factual basis&#x92; for the plea that is provided to the trial court.

When a defendant pleads in open court, there is less need for counsel to develop the record and refine claims to present to an appellate court.  These are all &#x93; &#x91;[r]easoned distinctions&#x92; &#x94; between defendants convicted by trial and those convicted by their own plea.

				The brief history of Michigan&#x92;s system confirms this.  When Michigan voters amended the State Constitution to establish the current system, roughly 13,000 civil and criminal appeals per year clogged the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; docket.  Of those, nearly a third were appeals by criminal defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.  Even though at the time plea-convicted defendants were appointed paid appellate counsel, few of these defendants were granted relief on appeal.  Simply put, Michigan&#x92;s bar and bench were devoting a substantial portion of their scarce resources to thousands of cases with little practical effect.  Reallocating resources was not &#x93;invidious discrimination&#x94; against criminal defendants, indigent or otherwise.

				Today&#x92;s decision will therefore do no favors for indigent defendants in Michigan&#x97;at least, indigent defendants with nonfrivolous claims.  While defendants who admit their guilt will receive more attention, defendants who maintain their innocence will receive less.  Even some defendants who plead guilty will feel the pinch, because plea-convicted defendants are entitled to counsel in preparing their leave applications if, for example, they appeal from conditional pleas, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(d) (2005), or their sentences exceed the applicable guidelines ranges, &#xA7;770.3a(2)(b).  And any plea-convicted defendant granted leave to appeal is entitled to appointed counsel.  &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Holding Michigan&#x92;s resources constant (since we have no control over the State&#x92;s bar or budget), the majority&#x92;s policy choice to redistribute the State&#x92;s limited resources only harms those most likely to have worthwhile claims&#x97;to say nothing of &#x93;the cost of enabling courts and prosecutors to respond to the &#x91;over-lawyering&#x92; of minor cases.&#x94;

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Michigan Court of Appeals probably does consider &#x93;the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; in exercising its discretion; so do other courts of discretionary review, including this Court.  For instance, this Court would be unlikely to grant a case to announce a rule that could not alter the case&#x92;s disposition, or to correct an error that had not affected the proceedings below.  This Court often considers whether errors are worth correcting in both plenary and summary dispositions.  None of this converts discretionary, error-noticing review into mandatory, error-correcting review.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Likewise, the Michigan Court of Appeals is not required to hear particular cases or correct particular errors.  It may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition questionable or dubious.  Or it may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition important or interesting.  For all we know, it may (and probably does) consider both.  Regardless, the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant review remains &#x93;discretionary,&#x94; because it does not depend on &#x93;whether there has been &#x91;a correct adjudication of guilt&#x92; in every individual case.&#x94;

				The majority appears to dispute that review before the Michigan Court of Appeals is truly discretionary,

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The majority claims that &#x93;[a]t the time he entered his plea, Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel he could elect to forgo.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  This assertion apparently refers to the Michigan statute, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000).  At the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, the statute provided that, if a defendant was convicted by plea, he generally could not receive appointed appellate counsel.  The majority&#x92;s reasoning is flawed for at least three reasons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the statement that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, is either incorrect or irrelevant.  If (as we must) we view the waiver decision from the perspective of Halbert and other defendants 
				<em>
					before entering a plea
				</em>
				, the statement is wrong as a matter of Michigan law.  The Michigan Court Rules applicable at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea explicitly provided that he was entitled to appointed appellate counsel if convicted following a trial.  Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(F)(1)(b) (Lexis 2001) (&#x93;In a case involving a conviction following a trial, if the defendant is indigent, the court must enter an order appointing a lawyer if the request is filed within 42 days after sentencing or within the time for filing an appeal of right&#x94;).  Michigan law thus gave Halbert, before entering a plea, the choice either to proceed to trial and guarantee himself appointed appellate counsel, or to plead guilty or no contest and forgo appointed appellate counsel in most circumstances.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Alternately, by stating that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, the majority might mean that Michigan law afforded Halbert no right to appointed appellate counsel following a plea-based conviction.  If so, the statement is true but irrelevant.  Of course Michigan law did not afford Halbert a right to appointed counsel once he pleaded no contest to the charged crimes.  But the question is whether, by pleading no contest with knowledge of the condition (no paid counsel on appeal), Halbert accepted the condition and thereby waived his right to paid counsel on appeal.  In other words, the question is whether Halbert had no right to counsel following his plea, because he had elected to forgo the right 
				<em>
					by pleading
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even if the majority were correct about Michigan law, that is beside the point.  At issue here is whether Halbert waived any federal constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				right to appointed appellate counsel he might have enjoyed.  Whether Michigan law provides for such counsel says nothing about whether a defendant possesses (and hence can waive) a federal constitutional right to that effect.  That Michigan, as a matter of state law, prohibited Halbert from receiving appointed appellate counsel if he pleaded guilty or no contest, is irrelevant to whether Halbert had (and could waive) an independent federal constitutional right to such counsel.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the majority implies that if the existence of a right to paid appellate counsel had been something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized&#x94; at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, then the right would have been waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  What this cryptic statement means is unclear.  But it cannot possibly mean that only rights that have been explicitly and uniformly recognized by statute or case law may be waived.  If that is what the statement means, then the majority has outlawed all conditional waivers (ones in which a defendant agrees that, if he has such a right, he waives it).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I take it instead that the reference to rights that are something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized,&#x94; and hence waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, means not just rights that are uniformly recognized, but also rights whose existence is unsettled.  If this understanding of the majority&#x92;s rule is correct, then the rule does not justify its claim that the constitutional right at issue was wholly unrecognized.  In fact, the existence of such a right was unsettled when Halbert entered his plea.  By that date, November 7, 2001, the Michigan Supreme Court had issued 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103, sustaining over a vigorous dissent the practice of denying the appointment of appellate counsel on application for leave to appeal a plea-based conviction; and a Federal District Court had enjoined Michigan state judges from denying the appointment of appellate counsel to indigents pursuant to the state statute, on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional,

					Tesmer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Kowalski
				</em>
				, 114 F. Supp. 2d 622, 625&#x96;629 (ED Mich. 2000).  The majority appears to focus on the fact that Michigan law did not afford defendants this right, but, again, state law is irrelevant to whether they possessed a federal constitutional right.  The existence of that right was unsettled
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea; hence, on what I take to

				be the majority&#x92;s own terms, the right should have been waivable.

Michigan law did not provide Halbert&#x97;as a defendant convicted by a plea of guilty or no contest&#x97;an appointed attorney to help him prepare an application for leave to appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  The Court holds Michigan&#x92;s law unconstitutional as applied to Halbert.

				To understand why the Court&#x92;s holding is an unwarranted extension of our precedents, it is necessary first to understand the limits that Michigan places on the provision of court-appointed counsel for defendants who plead guilty or no contest.  Before 1994, Michigan afforded all criminal defendants the right to appeal their convictions to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  By the early 1990&#x92;s, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals had a backlog of thousands of cases awaiting decision, nearly a third of which were appeals by defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.

				 v. 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 504, 614 N. W. 2d 103, 107 (2000).  To reduce this backlog, Michigan voters amended the Michigan Constitution in 1994 to provide that &#x93;[i]n every criminal prosecution, the accused shall &#x2026; have an appeal as a matter of right, except [that] &#x2026; an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich. Const., Art. 1, &#xA7;20; 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 107.  This constitutional amendment created a two-track system for Michigan defendants: The Michigan Court of Appeals must hear the appeals of those who dispute their guilt, while it may elect to hear the appeals of those who concede or do not contest their guilt of the substantive crime.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In 1999, the Michigan Legislature enacted the statute at issue here.  It provides that, in general, a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence.&#x94;  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(1) (West 2000).  Defendants who plead guilty or no contest do not, however, invariably lose the right to counsel on appeal; the statute contains exceptions to the general rule.  The trial court must appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants if the State seeks leave to appeal, the defendant&#x92;s sentence exceeds the upper limit of the applicable minimum guidelines range, or the defendant seeks leave to appeal a conditional plea.  &#xA7;770.3a(2).  Further, the trial court may appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants who seek leave to appeal certain sentencing errors.  &#xA7;770.3a(3).  Finally, if the Court of Appeals grants leave to appeal, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right,&#x94; Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(3) (2005), and the plea-convicted defendant is entitled to appointed counsel, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Thus, plea-convicted defendants lack appellate counsel only in certain types of cases, and only then when they are seeking leave to appeal.

				The majority nevertheless holds that Michigan&#x92;s system is constitutionally inadequate.  It finds that all plea-convicted indigent defendants have the right to appellate counsel when seeking leave to appeal.  The majority does not say where in the Constitution that right is located&#x97;the Due Process Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, or some purported confluence of the two.

, and later cases make clear.  Moreover, Michigan has not engaged in the sort of invidious discrimination against indigent defendants that 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 condemns.  Michigan has done no more than recognize the undeniable difference between defendants who plead guilty and those who maintain their innocence, in an attempt to divert resources from largely frivolous appeals to more meritorious ones.  The majority substitutes its own policy preference for that of Michigan voters, and it does so based on an untenable reading of

				In

				<em>

				  Thus the California appellate court was &#x93;forced to prejudge the merits&#x94; of indigent defendants&#x92; appeals, while it judged the merits of other defendants&#x92; appeals only after briefing and oral argument.

				Far from being an &#x93;arbitrary&#x94; or &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; distinction, Michigan&#x92;s differentiation between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea is sensible.  First and perhaps foremost, the danger of wrongful convictions is less significant than in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				.  In 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, California preliminarily denied counsel to all indigent defendants, regardless of whether they maintained their innocence at trial or conceded their guilt by plea.  Here, Michigan preliminarily denies paid counsel only to indigent defendants who admit or do not contest their guilt.  And because a defendant who pleads guilty &#x93;may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea,&#x94;

				, 462 Mich., at 517, and n. 7, 614 N. W. 2d, at 112&#x96;113, and n. 7.  Further, as the Michigan Supreme Court has explained, 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[p]lea proceedings are also shorter, simpler, and more routine than trials; the record most often consists of the &#x91;factual basis&#x92; for the plea that is provided to the trial court.

When a defendant pleads in open court, there is less need for counsel to develop the record and refine claims to present to an appellate court.  These are all &#x93; &#x91;[r]easoned distinctions&#x92; &#x94; between defendants convicted by trial and those convicted by their own plea.

				The brief history of Michigan&#x92;s system confirms this.  When Michigan voters amended the State Constitution to establish the current system, roughly 13,000 civil and criminal appeals per year clogged the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; docket.  Of those, nearly a third were appeals by criminal defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.  Even though at the time plea-convicted defendants were appointed paid appellate counsel, few of these defendants were granted relief on appeal.  Simply put, Michigan&#x92;s bar and bench were devoting a substantial portion of their scarce resources to thousands of cases with little practical effect.  Reallocating resources was not &#x93;invidious discrimination&#x94; against criminal defendants, indigent or otherwise.

				Today&#x92;s decision will therefore do no favors for indigent defendants in Michigan&#x97;at least, indigent defendants with nonfrivolous claims.  While defendants who admit their guilt will receive more attention, defendants who maintain their innocence will receive less.  Even some defendants who plead guilty will feel the pinch, because plea-convicted defendants are entitled to counsel in preparing their leave applications if, for example, they appeal from conditional pleas, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(d) (2005), or their sentences exceed the applicable guidelines ranges, &#xA7;770.3a(2)(b).  And any plea-convicted defendant granted leave to appeal is entitled to appointed counsel.  &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Holding Michigan&#x92;s resources constant (since we have no control over the State&#x92;s bar or budget), the majority&#x92;s policy choice to redistribute the State&#x92;s limited resources only harms those most likely to have worthwhile claims&#x97;to say nothing of &#x93;the cost of enabling courts and prosecutors to respond to the &#x91;over-lawyering&#x92; of minor cases.&#x94;

				The majority reasons that in adjudicating an application for leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals &#x93;is guided &#x2026; by the merits of the particular defendant&#x92;s claims.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The distinction that 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 drew, however, was not between appellate systems that involve &#x93;some evaluation of the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; and those that do not, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, but instead between discretionary and mandatory review.  
				<em>
					Supra

				<em>

				</em>
				 evaluated cases on their merits: These courts were hearing appeals as of right.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Michigan Court of Appeals probably does consider &#x93;the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; in exercising its discretion; so do other courts of discretionary review, including this Court.  For instance, this Court would be unlikely to grant a case to announce a rule that could not alter the case&#x92;s disposition, or to correct an error that had not affected the proceedings below.  This Court often considers whether errors are worth correcting in both plenary and summary dispositions.  None of this converts discretionary, error-noticing review into mandatory, error-correcting review.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Likewise, the Michigan Court of Appeals is not required to hear particular cases or correct particular errors.  It may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition questionable or dubious.  Or it may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition important or interesting.  For all we know, it may (and probably does) consider both.  Regardless, the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant review remains &#x93;discretionary,&#x94; because it does not depend on &#x93;whether there has been &#x91;a correct adjudication of guilt&#x92; in every individual case.&#x94;

				The majority appears to dispute that review before the Michigan Court of Appeals is truly discretionary, 
				<em>
					ante

				, at 10&#x96;11, and n. 4, but it provides no support for its speculation.  Unlike the California District Court of Appeal in 
				<em>

				<em>
					Bulger

				, 462 Mich., at 519, 614 N. W. 2d, at 113 (describing the issue as &#x93;whether a defendant is entitled under the federal constitution to appointed counsel in a first

				 appeal from a plea-based conviction&#x94; (emphasis in original)); 
				<em>
					id.

				, at 542&#x96;543, 614 N. W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting) (&#x93;Nothing in our court rules or statute precludes the Court of Appeals from denying leave even though it may believe that the trial court&#x92;s decision was incorrect&#x94;).  So far as we can tell, the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant or deny a leave application is not constrained by any state constitutional provision, statute, or court rule.  The Michigan Court of Appeals may deny leave for any reason, or for no reason at all.

				The majority&#x92;s holding suggests that Michigan&#x92;s system would pass constitutional muster if the Court of Appeals recited &#x93;lack of importance in the grounds presented&#x94; as its ground for denying leave,

And  even assuming the Michigan courts have special difficulty, it is unlikely any marginal gains will offset the harms wrought by the majority&#x92;s preference for redistributing resources to a set of generally less meritorious claims.

The Court is wrong in each respect.

        <p class="opcentered">
				1
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The majority claims that &#x93;[a]t the time he entered his plea, Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel he could elect to forgo.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  This assertion apparently refers to the Michigan statute, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000).  At the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, the statute provided that, if a defendant was convicted by plea, he generally could not receive appointed appellate counsel.  The majority&#x92;s reasoning is flawed for at least three reasons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the statement that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, is either incorrect or irrelevant.  If (as we must) we view the waiver decision from the perspective of Halbert and other defendants 
				<em>
					before entering a plea
				</em>
				, the statement is wrong as a matter of Michigan law.  The Michigan Court Rules applicable at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea explicitly provided that he was entitled to appointed appellate counsel if convicted following a trial.  Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(F)(1)(b) (Lexis 2001) (&#x93;In a case involving a conviction following a trial, if the defendant is indigent, the court must enter an order appointing a lawyer if the request is filed within 42 days after sentencing or within the time for filing an appeal of right&#x94;).  Michigan law thus gave Halbert, before entering a plea, the choice either to proceed to trial and guarantee himself appointed appellate counsel, or to plead guilty or no contest and forgo appointed appellate counsel in most circumstances.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Alternately, by stating that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, the majority might mean that Michigan law afforded Halbert no right to appointed appellate counsel following a plea-based conviction.  If so, the statement is true but irrelevant.  Of course Michigan law did not afford Halbert a right to appointed counsel once he pleaded no contest to the charged crimes.  But the question is whether, by pleading no contest with knowledge of the condition (no paid counsel on appeal), Halbert accepted the condition and thereby waived his right to paid counsel on appeal.  In other words, the question is whether Halbert had no right to counsel following his plea, because he had elected to forgo the right 
				<em>
					by pleading
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even if the majority were correct about Michigan law, that is beside the point.  At issue here is whether Halbert waived any federal constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				right to appointed appellate counsel he might have enjoyed.  Whether Michigan law provides for such counsel says nothing about whether a defendant possesses (and hence can waive) a federal constitutional right to that effect.  That Michigan, as a matter of state law, prohibited Halbert from receiving appointed appellate counsel if he pleaded guilty or no contest, is irrelevant to whether Halbert had (and could waive) an independent federal constitutional right to such counsel.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the majority implies that if the existence of a right to paid appellate counsel had been something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized&#x94; at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, then the right would have been waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  What this cryptic statement means is unclear.  But it cannot possibly mean that only rights that have been explicitly and uniformly recognized by statute or case law may be waived.  If that is what the statement means, then the majority has outlawed all conditional waivers (ones in which a defendant agrees that, if he has such a right, he waives it).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I take it instead that the reference to rights that are something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized,&#x94; and hence waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, means not just rights that are uniformly recognized, but also rights whose existence is unsettled.  If this understanding of the majority&#x92;s rule is correct, then the rule does not justify its claim that the constitutional right at issue was wholly unrecognized.  In fact, the existence of such a right was unsettled when Halbert entered his plea.  By that date, November 7, 2001, the Michigan Supreme Court had issued 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103, sustaining over a vigorous dissent the practice of denying the appointment of appellate counsel on application for leave to appeal a plea-based conviction; and a Federal District Court had enjoined Michigan state judges from denying the appointment of appellate counsel to indigents pursuant to the state statute, on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional,

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Kowalski
				</em>
				, 114 F. Supp. 2d 622, 625&#x96;629 (ED Mich. 2000).  The majority appears to focus on the fact that Michigan law did not afford defendants this right, but, again, state law is irrelevant to whether they possessed a federal constitutional right.  The existence of that right was unsettled
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea; hence, on what I take to

				be the majority&#x92;s own terms, the right should have been waivable.

Michigan law did not provide Halbert&#x97;as a defendant convicted by a plea of guilty or no contest&#x97;an appointed attorney to help him prepare an application for leave to appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  The Court holds Michigan&#x92;s law unconstitutional as applied to Halbert.

				To understand why the Court&#x92;s holding is an unwarranted extension of our precedents, it is necessary first to understand the limits that Michigan places on the provision of court-appointed counsel for defendants who plead guilty or no contest.  Before 1994, Michigan afforded all criminal defendants the right to appeal their convictions to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  By the early 1990&#x92;s, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals had a backlog of thousands of cases awaiting decision, nearly a third of which were appeals by defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.

				 v. 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 504, 614 N. W. 2d 103, 107 (2000).  To reduce this backlog, Michigan voters amended the Michigan Constitution in 1994 to provide that &#x93;[i]n every criminal prosecution, the accused shall &#x2026; have an appeal as a matter of right, except [that] &#x2026; an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich. Const., Art. 1, &#xA7;20; 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 107.  This constitutional amendment created a two-track system for Michigan defendants: The Michigan Court of Appeals must hear the appeals of those who dispute their guilt, while it may elect to hear the appeals of those who concede or do not contest their guilt of the substantive crime.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In 1999, the Michigan Legislature enacted the statute at issue here.  It provides that, in general, a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence.&#x94;  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(1) (West 2000).  Defendants who plead guilty or no contest do not, however, invariably lose the right to counsel on appeal; the statute contains exceptions to the general rule.  The trial court must appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants if the State seeks leave to appeal, the defendant&#x92;s sentence exceeds the upper limit of the applicable minimum guidelines range, or the defendant seeks leave to appeal a conditional plea.  &#xA7;770.3a(2).  Further, the trial court may appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants who seek leave to appeal certain sentencing errors.  &#xA7;770.3a(3).  Finally, if the Court of Appeals grants leave to appeal, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right,&#x94; Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(3) (2005), and the plea-convicted defendant is entitled to appointed counsel, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Thus, plea-convicted defendants lack appellate counsel only in certain types of cases, and only then when they are seeking leave to appeal.

				The majority nevertheless holds that Michigan&#x92;s system is constitutionally inadequate.  It finds that all plea-convicted indigent defendants have the right to appellate counsel when seeking leave to appeal.

				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 condemns.  Michigan has done no more than recognize the undeniable difference between defendants who plead guilty and those who maintain their innocence, in an attempt to divert resources from largely frivolous appeals to more meritorious ones.  The majority substitutes its own policy preference for that of Michigan voters, and it does so based on an untenable reading of

				Far from being an &#x93;arbitrary&#x94; or &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; distinction, Michigan&#x92;s differentiation between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea is sensible.  First and perhaps foremost, the danger of wrongful convictions is less significant than in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				.  In 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, California preliminarily denied counsel to all indigent defendants, regardless of whether they maintained their innocence at trial or conceded their guilt by plea.  Here, Michigan preliminarily denies paid counsel only to indigent defendants who admit or do not contest their guilt.

When a defendant pleads in open court, there is less need for counsel to develop the record and refine claims to present to an appellate court.  These are all &#x93; &#x91;[r]easoned distinctions&#x92; &#x94; between defendants convicted by trial and those convicted by their own plea.

				The brief history of Michigan&#x92;s system confirms this.  When Michigan voters amended the State Constitution to establish the current system, roughly 13,000 civil and criminal appeals per year clogged the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; docket.  Of those, nearly a third were appeals by criminal defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.  Even though at the time plea-convicted defendants were appointed paid appellate counsel, few of these defendants were granted relief on appeal.  Simply put, Michigan&#x92;s bar and bench were devoting a substantial portion of their scarce resources to thousands of cases with little practical effect.  Reallocating resources was not &#x93;invidious discrimination&#x94; against criminal defendants, indigent or otherwise.

				Today&#x92;s decision will therefore do no favors for indigent defendants in Michigan&#x97;at least, indigent defendants with nonfrivolous claims.  While defendants who admit their guilt will receive more attention, defendants who maintain their innocence will receive less.  Even some defendants who plead guilty will feel the pinch, because plea-convicted defendants are entitled to counsel in preparing their leave applications if, for example, they appeal from conditional pleas, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(d) (2005), or their sentences exceed the applicable guidelines ranges, &#xA7;770.3a(2)(b).  And any plea-convicted defendant granted leave to appeal is entitled to appointed counsel.  &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Holding Michigan&#x92;s resources constant (since we have no control over the State&#x92;s bar or budget), the majority&#x92;s policy choice to redistribute the State&#x92;s limited resources only harms those most likely to have worthwhile claims&#x97;to say nothing of &#x93;the cost of enabling courts and prosecutors to respond to the &#x91;over-lawyering&#x92; of minor cases.&#x94;

				 First, when a plea-convicted defendant seeks leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals adjudicates the leave application with reference to the merits.

				The majority reasons that in adjudicating an application for leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals &#x93;is guided &#x2026; by the merits of the particular defendant&#x92;s claims.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Michigan Court of Appeals probably does consider &#x93;the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; in exercising its discretion; so do other courts of discretionary review, including this Court.  For instance, this Court would be unlikely to grant a case to announce a rule that could not alter the case&#x92;s disposition, or to correct an error that had not affected the proceedings below.  This Court often considers whether errors are worth correcting in both plenary and summary dispositions.  None of this converts discretionary, error-noticing review into mandatory, error-correcting review.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Likewise, the Michigan Court of Appeals is not required to hear particular cases or correct particular errors.  It may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition questionable or dubious.  Or it may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition important or interesting.  For all we know, it may (and probably does) consider both.  Regardless, the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant review remains &#x93;discretionary,&#x94; because it does not depend on &#x93;whether there has been &#x91;a correct adjudication of guilt&#x92; in every individual case.&#x94;

				The majority appears to dispute that review before the Michigan Court of Appeals is truly discretionary,

So far as we can tell, the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant or deny a leave application is not constrained by any state constitutional provision, statute, or court rule.  The Michigan Court of Appeals may deny leave for any reason, or for no reason at all.

				The majority&#x92;s holding suggests that Michigan&#x92;s system would pass constitutional muster if the Court of Appeals recited &#x93;lack of importance in the grounds presented&#x94; as its ground for denying leave,

				Lacking support in this Court&#x92;s cases, the majority effects a not-so-subtle shift from whether the record is adequate to enable discretionary review to whether plea-convicted defendants are generally able to &#x93;[n]aviga[te] the appellate process without a lawyer&#x92;s assistance.&#x94;

At the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, the statute provided that, if a defendant was convicted by plea, he generally could not receive appointed appellate counsel.  The majority&#x92;s reasoning is flawed for at least three reasons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the statement that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, is either incorrect or irrelevant.  If (as we must) we view the waiver decision from the perspective of Halbert and other defendants 
				<em>
					before entering a plea
				</em>
				, the statement is wrong as a matter of Michigan law.  The Michigan Court Rules applicable at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea explicitly provided that he was entitled to appointed appellate counsel if convicted following a trial.  Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(F)(1)(b) (Lexis 2001) (&#x93;In a case involving a conviction following a trial, if the defendant is indigent, the court must enter an order appointing a lawyer if the request is filed within 42 days after sentencing or within the time for filing an appeal of right&#x94;).  Michigan law thus gave Halbert, before entering a plea, the choice either to proceed to trial and guarantee himself appointed appellate counsel, or to plead guilty or no contest and forgo appointed appellate counsel in most circumstances.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Alternately, by stating that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, the majority might mean that Michigan law afforded Halbert no right to appointed appellate counsel following a plea-based conviction.  If so, the statement is true but irrelevant.  Of course Michigan law did not afford Halbert a right to appointed counsel once he pleaded no contest to the charged crimes.  But the question is whether, by pleading no contest with knowledge of the condition (no paid counsel on appeal), Halbert accepted the condition and thereby waived his right to paid counsel on appeal.  In other words, the question is whether Halbert had no right to counsel following his plea, because he had elected to forgo the right 
				<em>
					by pleading
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even if the majority were correct about Michigan law, that is beside the point.  At issue here is whether Halbert waived any federal constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				right to appointed appellate counsel he might have enjoyed.  Whether Michigan law provides for such counsel says nothing about whether a defendant possesses (and hence can waive) a federal constitutional right to that effect.  That Michigan, as a matter of state law, prohibited Halbert from receiving appointed appellate counsel if he pleaded guilty or no contest, is irrelevant to whether Halbert had (and could waive) an independent federal constitutional right to such counsel.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the majority implies that if the existence of a right to paid appellate counsel had been something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized&#x94; at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, then the right would have been waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  What this cryptic statement means is unclear.  But it cannot possibly mean that only rights that have been explicitly and uniformly recognized by statute or case law may be waived.  If that is what the statement means, then the majority has outlawed all conditional waivers (ones in which a defendant agrees that, if he has such a right, he waives it).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I take it instead that the reference to rights that are something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized,&#x94; and hence waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, means not just rights that are uniformly recognized, but also rights whose existence is unsettled.  If this understanding of the majority&#x92;s rule is correct, then the rule does not justify its claim that the constitutional right at issue was wholly unrecognized.  In fact, the existence of such a right was unsettled when Halbert entered his plea.  By that date, November 7, 2001, the Michigan Supreme Court had issued 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103, sustaining over a vigorous dissent the practice of denying the appointment of appellate counsel on application for leave to appeal a plea-based conviction; and a Federal District Court had enjoined Michigan state judges from denying the appointment of appellate counsel to indigents pursuant to the state statute, on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional, 
				<em>
					Tesmer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Kowalski
				</em>
				, 114 F. Supp. 2d 622, 625&#x96;629 (ED Mich. 2000).  The majority appears to focus on the fact that Michigan law did not afford defendants this right, but, again, state law is irrelevant to whether they possessed a federal constitutional right.  The existence of that right was unsettled
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea; hence, on what I take to
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				be the majority&#x92;s own terms, the right should have been waivable.

				The majority attempts to deflect this criticism by saying that &#x93;nothing in Halbert&#x92;s plea colloquy indicates that he waived an &#x91;unsettled&#x92; &#x2026; but assumed right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel, post-plea.&#x94;

				To understand why the Court&#x92;s holding is an unwarranted extension of our precedents, it is necessary first to understand the limits that Michigan places on the provision of court-appointed counsel for defendants who plead guilty or no contest.  Before 1994, Michigan afforded all criminal defendants the right to appeal their convictions to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  By the early 1990&#x92;s, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals had a backlog of thousands of cases awaiting decision, nearly a third of which were appeals by defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.

				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 504, 614 N. W. 2d 103, 107 (2000).  To reduce this backlog, Michigan voters amended the Michigan Constitution in 1994 to provide that &#x93;[i]n every criminal prosecution, the accused shall &#x2026; have an appeal as a matter of right, except [that] &#x2026; an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich. Const., Art. 1, &#xA7;20; 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 107.  This constitutional amendment created a two-track system for Michigan defendants: The Michigan Court of Appeals must hear the appeals of those who dispute their guilt, while it may elect to hear the appeals of those who concede or do not contest their guilt of the substantive crime.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In 1999, the Michigan Legislature enacted the statute at issue here.  It provides that, in general, a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence.&#x94;  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(1) (West 2000).  Defendants who plead guilty or no contest do not, however, invariably lose the right to counsel on appeal; the statute contains exceptions to the general rule.  The trial court must appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants if the State seeks leave to appeal, the defendant&#x92;s sentence exceeds the upper limit of the applicable minimum guidelines range, or the defendant seeks leave to appeal a conditional plea.  &#xA7;770.3a(2).  Further, the trial court may appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants who seek leave to appeal certain sentencing errors.  &#xA7;770.3a(3).  Finally, if the Court of Appeals grants leave to appeal, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right,&#x94; Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(3) (2005), and the plea-convicted defendant is entitled to appointed counsel, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Thus, plea-convicted defendants lack appellate counsel only in certain types of cases, and only then when they are seeking leave to appeal.

				The majority nevertheless holds that Michigan&#x92;s system is constitutionally inadequate.  It finds that all plea-convicted indigent defendants have the right to appellate counsel when seeking leave to appeal.

				Far from being an &#x93;arbitrary&#x94; or &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; distinction, Michigan&#x92;s differentiation between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea is sensible.  First and perhaps foremost, the danger of wrongful convictions is less significant than in 
				<em>

				&#x93;[p]lea proceedings are also shorter, simpler, and more routine than trials; the record most often consists of the &#x91;factual basis&#x92; for the plea that is provided to the trial court.

When a defendant pleads in open court, there is less need for counsel to develop the record and refine claims to present to an appellate court.  These are all &#x93; &#x91;[r]easoned distinctions&#x92; &#x94; between defendants convicted by trial and those convicted by their own plea.

				The brief history of Michigan&#x92;s system confirms this.  When Michigan voters amended the State Constitution to establish the current system, roughly 13,000 civil and criminal appeals per year clogged the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; docket.  Of those, nearly a third were appeals by criminal defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.  Even though at the time plea-convicted defendants were appointed paid appellate counsel, few of these defendants were granted relief on appeal.  Simply put, Michigan&#x92;s bar and bench were devoting a substantial portion of their scarce resources to thousands of cases with little practical effect.  Reallocating resources was not &#x93;invidious discrimination&#x94; against criminal defendants, indigent or otherwise.

				Today&#x92;s decision will therefore do no favors for indigent defendants in Michigan&#x97;at least, indigent defendants with nonfrivolous claims.  While defendants who admit their guilt will receive more attention, defendants who maintain their innocence will receive less.  Even some defendants who plead guilty will feel the pinch, because plea-convicted defendants are entitled to counsel in preparing their leave applications if, for example, they appeal from conditional pleas, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(d) (2005), or their sentences exceed the applicable guidelines ranges, &#xA7;770.3a(2)(b).  And any plea-convicted defendant granted leave to appeal is entitled to appointed counsel.  &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Holding Michigan&#x92;s resources constant (since we have no control over the State&#x92;s bar or budget), the majority&#x92;s policy choice to redistribute the State&#x92;s limited resources only harms those most likely to have worthwhile claims&#x97;to say nothing of &#x93;the cost of enabling courts and prosecutors to respond to the &#x91;over-lawyering&#x92; of minor cases.&#x94;

				The majority does not attempt to demonstrate that Michigan&#x92;s system is the sort of &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; discrimination against indigent defendants 
				<em>

					Douglas:
				</em>
				 First, when a plea-convicted defendant seeks leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals adjudicates the leave application with reference to the merits.

			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The majority reasons that in adjudicating an application for leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals &#x93;is guided &#x2026; by the merits of the particular defendant&#x92;s claims.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The distinction that 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 drew, however, was not between appellate systems that involve &#x93;some evaluation of the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; and those that do not, 
				<em>

				<em>

				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 evaluated cases on their merits: These courts were hearing appeals as of right.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Michigan Court of Appeals probably does consider &#x93;the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; in exercising its discretion; so do other courts of discretionary review, including this Court.  For instance, this Court would be unlikely to grant a case to announce a rule that could not alter the case&#x92;s disposition, or to correct an error that had not affected the proceedings below.  This Court often considers whether errors are worth correcting in both plenary and summary dispositions.  None of this converts discretionary, error-noticing review into mandatory, error-correcting review.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Likewise, the Michigan Court of Appeals is not required to hear particular cases or correct particular errors.  It may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition questionable or dubious.  Or it may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition important or interesting.  For all we know, it may (and probably does) consider both.  Regardless, the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant review remains &#x93;discretionary,&#x94; because it does not depend on &#x93;whether there has been &#x91;a correct adjudication of guilt&#x92; in every individual case.&#x94;  
				<em>

				The majority appears to dispute that review before the Michigan Court of Appeals is truly discretionary, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10&#x96;11, and n. 4, but it provides no support for its speculation.  Unlike the California District Court of Appeal in 
				<em>

				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich., at 519, 614 N. W. 2d, at 113 (describing the issue as &#x93;whether a defendant is entitled under the federal constitution to appointed counsel in a first

				<em>

				, at 542&#x96;543, 614 N. W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting) (&#x93;Nothing in our court rules or statute precludes the Court of Appeals from denying leave even though it may believe that the trial court&#x92;s decision was incorrect&#x94;).  So far as we can tell, the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant or deny a leave application is not constrained by any state constitutional provision, statute, or court rule.  The Michigan Court of Appeals may deny leave for any reason, or for no reason at all.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority&#x92;s holding suggests that Michigan&#x92;s system would pass constitutional muster if the Court of Appeals recited &#x93;lack of importance in the grounds presented&#x94; as its ground for denying leave,

				Lacking support in this Court&#x92;s cases, the majority effects a not-so-subtle shift from whether the record is adequate to enable discretionary review to whether plea-convicted defendants are generally able to &#x93;[n]aviga[te] the appellate process without a lawyer&#x92;s assistance.&#x94;

				The majority maintains, first, that Halbert could not waive the right to appointed appellate counsel because Michigan law afforded him no such right to waive; second, in dictum, that the right cannot be waived; and, third, that even if the right can be waived, Halbert did not knowingly and intelligently waive it here.  The Court is wrong in each respect.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The majority claims that &#x93;[a]t the time he entered his plea, Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel he could elect to forgo.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  This assertion apparently refers to the Michigan statute, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000).  At the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, the statute provided that, if a defendant was convicted by plea, he generally could not receive appointed appellate counsel.  The majority&#x92;s reasoning is flawed for at least three reasons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the statement that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, is either incorrect or irrelevant.  If (as we must) we view the waiver decision from the perspective of Halbert and other defendants 
				<em>
					before entering a plea
				</em>
				, the statement is wrong as a matter of Michigan law.  The Michigan Court Rules applicable at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea explicitly provided that he was entitled to appointed appellate counsel if convicted following a trial.  Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(F)(1)(b) (Lexis 2001) (&#x93;In a case involving a conviction following a trial, if the defendant is indigent, the court must enter an order appointing a lawyer if the request is filed within 42 days after sentencing or within the time for filing an appeal of right&#x94;).  Michigan law thus gave Halbert, before entering a plea, the choice either to proceed to trial and guarantee himself appointed appellate counsel, or to plead guilty or no contest and forgo appointed appellate counsel in most circumstances.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Alternately, by stating that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, the majority might mean that Michigan law afforded Halbert no right to appointed appellate counsel following a plea-based conviction.  If so, the statement is true but irrelevant.  Of course Michigan law did not afford Halbert a right to appointed counsel once he pleaded no contest to the charged crimes.  But the question is whether, by pleading no contest with knowledge of the condition (no paid counsel on appeal), Halbert accepted the condition and thereby waived his right to paid counsel on appeal.  In other words, the question is whether Halbert had no right to counsel following his plea, because he had elected to forgo the right 
				<em>
					by pleading
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even if the majority were correct about Michigan law, that is beside the point.  At issue here is whether Halbert waived any federal constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				right to appointed appellate counsel he might have enjoyed.  Whether Michigan law provides for such counsel says nothing about whether a defendant possesses (and hence can waive) a federal constitutional right to that effect.  That Michigan, as a matter of state law, prohibited Halbert from receiving appointed appellate counsel if he pleaded guilty or no contest, is irrelevant to whether Halbert had (and could waive) an independent federal constitutional right to such counsel.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the majority implies that if the existence of a right to paid appellate counsel had been something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized&#x94; at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, then the right would have been waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  What this cryptic statement means is unclear.  But it cannot possibly mean that only rights that have been explicitly and uniformly recognized by statute or case law may be waived.  If that is what the statement means, then the majority has outlawed all conditional waivers (ones in which a defendant agrees that, if he has such a right, he waives it).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I take it instead that the reference to rights that are something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized,&#x94; and hence waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, means not just rights that are uniformly recognized, but also rights whose existence is unsettled.  If this understanding of the majority&#x92;s rule is correct, then the rule does not justify its claim that the constitutional right at issue was wholly unrecognized.  In fact, the existence of such a right was unsettled when Halbert entered his plea.  By that date, November 7, 2001, the Michigan Supreme Court had issued 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103, sustaining over a vigorous dissent the practice of denying the appointment of appellate counsel on application for leave to appeal a plea-based conviction; and a Federal District Court had enjoined Michigan state judges from denying the appointment of appellate counsel to indigents pursuant to the state statute, on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional, 
				<em>
					Tesmer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Kowalski
				</em>
				, 114 F. Supp. 2d 622, 625&#x96;629 (ED Mich. 2000).  The majority appears to focus on the fact that Michigan law did not afford defendants this right, but, again, state law is irrelevant to whether they possessed a federal constitutional right.  The existence of that right was unsettled
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea; hence, on what I take to
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				be the majority&#x92;s own terms, the right should have been waivable.

				The majority attempts to deflect this criticism by saying that &#x93;nothing in Halbert&#x92;s plea colloquy indicates that he waived an &#x91;unsettled&#x92; &#x2026; but assumed right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel, post-plea.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16, n. 7.  But any arguable inadequacy in the plea colloquy is a separate issue from, and is irrelevant to, the question at hand: whether the right was recognized, and hence waivable by Halbert (or any other defendant deciding how to plead), irrespective of the content of the plea colloquy.

				<em>
					Mezzanatto, supra,

				In this case, the plea colloquy shows that Halbert&#x92;s waiver was knowing and intelligent, and that any deficiency in the plea colloquy was harmless.  See

In context, the court&#x92;s enumeration of the limited conditions in which counsel might be appointed informed Halbert that counsel would not be appointed in other circumstances.

				To understand why the Court&#x92;s holding is an unwarranted extension of our precedents, it is necessary first to understand the limits that Michigan places on the provision of court-appointed counsel for defendants who plead guilty or no contest.  Before 1994, Michigan afforded all criminal defendants the right to appeal their convictions to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  By the early 1990&#x92;s, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals had a backlog of thousands of cases awaiting decision, nearly a third of which were appeals by defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.

					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 504, 614 N. W. 2d 103, 107 (2000).  To reduce this backlog, Michigan voters amended the Michigan Constitution in 1994 to provide that &#x93;[i]n every criminal prosecution, the accused shall &#x2026; have an appeal as a matter of right, except [that] &#x2026; an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich. Const., Art. 1, &#xA7;20; 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 107.  This constitutional amendment created a two-track system for Michigan defendants: The Michigan Court of Appeals must hear the appeals of those who dispute their guilt, while it may elect to hear the appeals of those who concede or do not contest their guilt of the substantive crime.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In 1999, the Michigan Legislature enacted the statute at issue here.  It provides that, in general, a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence.&#x94;  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(1) (West 2000).  Defendants who plead guilty or no contest do not, however, invariably lose the right to counsel on appeal; the statute contains exceptions to the general rule.  The trial court must appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants if the State seeks leave to appeal, the defendant&#x92;s sentence exceeds the upper limit of the applicable minimum guidelines range, or the defendant seeks leave to appeal a conditional plea.  &#xA7;770.3a(2).  Further, the trial court may appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants who seek leave to appeal certain sentencing errors.  &#xA7;770.3a(3).  Finally, if the Court of Appeals grants leave to appeal, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right,&#x94; Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(3) (2005), and the plea-convicted defendant is entitled to appointed counsel, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Thus, plea-convicted defendants lack appellate counsel only in certain types of cases, and only then when they are seeking leave to appeal.

				The majority nevertheless holds that Michigan&#x92;s system is constitutionally inadequate.  It finds that all plea-convicted indigent defendants have the right to appellate counsel when seeking leave to appeal.

				Far from being an &#x93;arbitrary&#x94; or &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; distinction, Michigan&#x92;s differentiation between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea is sensible.  First and perhaps foremost, the danger of wrongful convictions is less significant than in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				.  In 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, California preliminarily denied counsel to all indigent defendants, regardless of whether they maintained their innocence at trial or conceded their guilt by plea.

        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[p]lea proceedings are also shorter, simpler, and more routine than trials; the record most often consists of the &#x91;factual basis&#x92; for the plea that is provided to the trial court.  In contrast with trials, less danger exists in plea cases that the record will be so unclear, or the errors so hidden, that the defendant&#x92;s appeal will be reduced to a meaningless ritual.&#x94;

When a defendant pleads in open court, there is less need for counsel to develop the record and refine claims to present to an appellate court.  These are all &#x93; &#x91;[r]easoned distinctions&#x92; &#x94; between defendants convicted by trial and those convicted by their own plea.

				The brief history of Michigan&#x92;s system confirms this.  When Michigan voters amended the State Constitution to establish the current system, roughly 13,000 civil and criminal appeals per year clogged the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; docket.  Of those, nearly a third were appeals by criminal defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.  Even though at the time plea-convicted defendants were appointed paid appellate counsel, few of these defendants were granted relief on appeal.  Simply put, Michigan&#x92;s bar and bench were devoting a substantial portion of their scarce resources to thousands of cases with little practical effect.  Reallocating resources was not &#x93;invidious discrimination&#x94; against criminal defendants, indigent or otherwise.

				Today&#x92;s decision will therefore do no favors for indigent defendants in Michigan&#x97;at least, indigent defendants with nonfrivolous claims.  While defendants who admit their guilt will receive more attention, defendants who maintain their innocence will receive less.  Even some defendants who plead guilty will feel the pinch, because plea-convicted defendants are entitled to counsel in preparing their leave applications if, for example, they appeal from conditional pleas, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(d) (2005), or their sentences exceed the applicable guidelines ranges, &#xA7;770.3a(2)(b).  And any plea-convicted defendant granted leave to appeal is entitled to appointed counsel.  &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Holding Michigan&#x92;s resources constant (since we have no control over the State&#x92;s bar or budget), the majority&#x92;s policy choice to redistribute the State&#x92;s limited resources only harms those most likely to have worthwhile claims&#x97;to say nothing of &#x93;the cost of enabling courts and prosecutors to respond to the &#x91;over-lawyering&#x92; of minor cases.&#x94;

				The majority does not attempt to demonstrate that Michigan&#x92;s system is the sort of &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; discrimination against indigent defendants 
				<em>
					Douglas

				<em>
					Douglas:
				</em>
				 First, when a plea-convicted defendant seeks leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals adjudicates the leave application with reference to the merits.

			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				1
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The majority reasons that in adjudicating an application for leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals &#x93;is guided &#x2026; by the merits of the particular defendant&#x92;s claims.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  The distinction that 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 drew, however, was not between appellate systems that involve &#x93;some evaluation of the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; and those that do not, 
				<em>

				<em>

				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				 evaluated cases on their merits: These courts were hearing appeals as of right.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Michigan Court of Appeals probably does consider &#x93;the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; in exercising its discretion; so do other courts of discretionary review, including this Court.  For instance, this Court would be unlikely to grant a case to announce a rule that could not alter the case&#x92;s disposition, or to correct an error that had not affected the proceedings below.  This Court often considers whether errors are worth correcting in both plenary and summary dispositions.  None of this converts discretionary, error-noticing review into mandatory, error-correcting review.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Likewise, the Michigan Court of Appeals is not required to hear particular cases or correct particular errors.  It may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition questionable or dubious.  Or it may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition important or interesting.  For all we know, it may (and probably does) consider both.  Regardless, the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant review remains &#x93;discretionary,&#x94; because it does not depend on &#x93;whether there has been &#x91;a correct adjudication of guilt&#x92; in every individual case.&#x94;  
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority appears to dispute that review before the Michigan Court of Appeals is truly discretionary, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10&#x96;11, and n. 4, but it provides no support for its speculation.  Unlike the California District Court of Appeal in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, the Michigan Court of Appeals has discretion in deciding whether to grant leave applications.  See 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich., at 519, 614 N. W. 2d, at 113 (describing the issue as &#x93;whether a defendant is entitled under the federal constitution to appointed counsel in a first 
				<em>
					discretionary
				</em>
				 appeal from a plea-based conviction&#x94; (emphasis in original)); 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 542&#x96;543, 614 N. W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting) (&#x93;Nothing in our court rules or statute precludes the Court of Appeals from denying leave even though it may believe that the trial court&#x92;s decision was incorrect&#x94;).  So far as we can tell, the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant or deny a leave application is not constrained by any state constitutional provision, statute, or court rule.  The Michigan Court of Appeals may deny leave for any reason, or for no reason at all.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority&#x92;s holding suggests that Michigan&#x92;s system would pass constitutional muster if the Court of Appeals recited &#x93;lack of importance in the grounds presented&#x94; as its ground for denying leave, 
				<em>

The Court is wrong in each respect.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The majority claims that &#x93;[a]t the time he entered his plea, Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel he could elect to forgo.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  This assertion apparently refers to the Michigan statute, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000).  At the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, the statute provided that, if a defendant was convicted by plea, he generally could not receive appointed appellate counsel.  The majority&#x92;s reasoning is flawed for at least three reasons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the statement that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, is either incorrect or irrelevant.  If (as we must) we view the waiver decision from the perspective of Halbert and other defendants 
				<em>
					before entering a plea
				</em>
				, the statement is wrong as a matter of Michigan law.  The Michigan Court Rules applicable at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea explicitly provided that he was entitled to appointed appellate counsel if convicted following a trial.  Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(F)(1)(b) (Lexis 2001) (&#x93;In a case involving a conviction following a trial, if the defendant is indigent, the court must enter an order appointing a lawyer if the request is filed within 42 days after sentencing or within the time for filing an appeal of right&#x94;).  Michigan law thus gave Halbert, before entering a plea, the choice either to proceed to trial and guarantee himself appointed appellate counsel, or to plead guilty or no contest and forgo appointed appellate counsel in most circumstances.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Alternately, by stating that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, the majority might mean that Michigan law afforded Halbert no right to appointed appellate counsel following a plea-based conviction.  If so, the statement is true but irrelevant.  Of course Michigan law did not afford Halbert a right to appointed counsel once he pleaded no contest to the charged crimes.  But the question is whether, by pleading no contest with knowledge of the condition (no paid counsel on appeal), Halbert accepted the condition and thereby waived his right to paid counsel on appeal.  In other words, the question is whether Halbert had no right to counsel following his plea, because he had elected to forgo the right 
				<em>
					by pleading
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even if the majority were correct about Michigan law, that is beside the point.  At issue here is whether Halbert waived any federal constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				right to appointed appellate counsel he might have enjoyed.  Whether Michigan law provides for such counsel says nothing about whether a defendant possesses (and hence can waive) a federal constitutional right to that effect.  That Michigan, as a matter of state law, prohibited Halbert from receiving appointed appellate counsel if he pleaded guilty or no contest, is irrelevant to whether Halbert had (and could waive) an independent federal constitutional right to such counsel.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the majority implies that if the existence of a right to paid appellate counsel had been something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized&#x94; at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, then the right would have been waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  What this cryptic statement means is unclear.  But it cannot possibly mean that only rights that have been explicitly and uniformly recognized by statute or case law may be waived.  If that is what the statement means, then the majority has outlawed all conditional waivers (ones in which a defendant agrees that, if he has such a right, he waives it).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I take it instead that the reference to rights that are something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized,&#x94; and hence waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, means not just rights that are uniformly recognized, but also rights whose existence is unsettled.  If this understanding of the majority&#x92;s rule is correct, then the rule does not justify its claim that the constitutional right at issue was wholly unrecognized.  In fact, the existence of such a right was unsettled when Halbert entered his plea.  By that date, November 7, 2001, the Michigan Supreme Court had issued 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103, sustaining over a vigorous dissent the practice of denying the appointment of appellate counsel on application for leave to appeal a plea-based conviction; and a Federal District Court had enjoined Michigan state judges from denying the appointment of appellate counsel to indigents pursuant to the state statute, on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional, 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Kowalski
				</em>
				, 114 F. Supp. 2d 622, 625&#x96;629 (ED Mich. 2000).  The majority appears to focus on the fact that Michigan law did not afford defendants this right, but, again, state law is irrelevant to whether they possessed a federal constitutional right.  The existence of that right was unsettled
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea; hence, on what I take to
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				be the majority&#x92;s own terms, the right should have been waivable.

				The majority attempts to deflect this criticism by saying that &#x93;nothing in Halbert&#x92;s plea colloquy indicates that he waived an &#x91;unsettled&#x92; &#x2026; but assumed right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel, post-plea.&#x94;

				, at 16, n. 7.  But any arguable inadequacy in the plea colloquy is a separate issue from, and is irrelevant to, the question at hand: whether the right was recognized, and hence waivable by Halbert (or any other defendant deciding how to plead), irrespective of the content of the plea colloquy.

				<em>

Michigan law did not provide Halbert&#x97;as a defendant convicted by a plea of guilty or no contest&#x97;an appointed attorney to help him prepare an application for leave to appeal to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  The Court holds Michigan&#x92;s law unconstitutional as applied to Halbert.  It fails, however, to ground its analysis in any particular provision of the Constitution or in this Court&#x92;s precedents.

				To understand why the Court&#x92;s holding is an unwarranted extension of our precedents, it is necessary first to understand the limits that Michigan places on the provision of court-appointed counsel for defendants who plead guilty or no contest.  Before 1994, Michigan afforded all criminal defendants the right to appeal their convictions to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  By the early 1990&#x92;s, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals had a backlog of thousands of cases awaiting decision, nearly a third of which were appeals by defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.

To reduce this backlog, Michigan voters amended the Michigan Constitution in 1994 to provide that &#x93;[i]n every criminal prosecution, the accused shall &#x2026; have an appeal as a matter of right, except [that] &#x2026; an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich.

				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 107.  This constitutional amendment created a two-track system for Michigan defendants: The Michigan Court of Appeals must hear the appeals of those who dispute their guilt, while it may elect to hear the appeals of those who concede or do not contest their guilt of the substantive crime.

				In 1999, the Michigan Legislature enacted the statute at issue here.  It provides that, in general, a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence.&#x94;  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(1) (West 2000).  Defendants who plead guilty or no contest do not, however, invariably lose the right to counsel on appeal; the statute contains exceptions to the general rule.  The trial court must appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants if the State seeks leave to appeal, the defendant&#x92;s sentence exceeds the upper limit of the applicable minimum guidelines range, or the defendant seeks leave to appeal a conditional plea.  &#xA7;770.3a(2).  Further, the trial court may appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants who seek leave to appeal certain sentencing errors.  &#xA7;770.3a(3).  Finally, if the Court of Appeals grants leave to appeal, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right,&#x94; Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(3) (2005), and the plea-convicted defendant is entitled to appointed counsel, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Thus, plea-convicted defendants lack appellate counsel only in certain types of cases, and only then when they are seeking leave to appeal.

				The majority nevertheless holds that Michigan&#x92;s system is constitutionally inadequate.  It finds that all plea-convicted indigent defendants have the right to appellate counsel when seeking leave to appeal.

				Far from being an &#x93;arbitrary&#x94; or &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; distinction, Michigan&#x92;s differentiation between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea is sensible.  First and perhaps foremost, the danger of wrongful convictions is less significant than in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				.  In 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, California preliminarily denied counsel to all indigent defendants, regardless of whether they maintained their innocence at trial or conceded their guilt by plea.  Here, Michigan preliminarily denies paid counsel only to indigent defendants who admit or do not contest their guilt.  And because a defendant who pleads guilty &#x93;may not thereafter raise independent claims relating to the deprivation of constitutional rights that occurred prior to the entry of the guilty plea,&#x94;

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[p]lea proceedings are also shorter, simpler, and more routine than trials; the record most often consists of the &#x91;factual basis&#x92; for the plea that is provided to the trial court.  In contrast with trials, less danger exists in plea cases that the record will be so unclear, or the errors so hidden, that the defendant&#x92;s appeal will be reduced to a meaningless ritual.&#x94;

When a defendant pleads in open court, there is less need for counsel to develop the record and refine claims to present to an appellate court.  These are all &#x93; &#x91;[r]easoned distinctions&#x92; &#x94; between defendants convicted by trial and those convicted by their own plea.

				The brief history of Michigan&#x92;s system confirms this.  When Michigan voters amended the State Constitution to establish the current system, roughly 13,000 civil and criminal appeals per year clogged the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; docket.  Of those, nearly a third were appeals by criminal defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.  Even though at the time plea-convicted defendants were appointed paid appellate counsel, few of these defendants were granted relief on appeal.  Simply put, Michigan&#x92;s bar and bench were devoting a substantial portion of their scarce resources to thousands of cases with little practical effect.  Reallocating resources was not &#x93;invidious discrimination&#x94; against criminal defendants, indigent or otherwise.

				Today&#x92;s decision will therefore do no favors for indigent defendants in Michigan&#x97;at least, indigent defendants with nonfrivolous claims.  While defendants who admit their guilt will receive more attention, defendants who maintain their innocence will receive less.  Even some defendants who plead guilty will feel the pinch, because plea-convicted defendants are entitled to counsel in preparing their leave applications if, for example, they appeal from conditional pleas, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(d) (2005), or their sentences exceed the applicable guidelines ranges, &#xA7;770.3a(2)(b).  And any plea-convicted defendant granted leave to appeal is entitled to appointed counsel.  &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Holding Michigan&#x92;s resources constant (since we have no control over the State&#x92;s bar or budget), the majority&#x92;s policy choice to redistribute the State&#x92;s limited resources only harms those most likely to have worthwhile claims&#x97;to say nothing of &#x93;the cost of enabling courts and prosecutors to respond to the &#x91;over-lawyering&#x92; of minor cases.&#x94;

				The majority reasons that in adjudicating an application for leave to appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals &#x93;is guided &#x2026; by the merits of the particular defendant&#x92;s claims.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Michigan Court of Appeals probably does consider &#x93;the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; in exercising its discretion; so do other courts of discretionary review, including this Court.  For instance, this Court would be unlikely to grant a case to announce a rule that could not alter the case&#x92;s disposition, or to correct an error that had not affected the proceedings below.  This Court often considers whether errors are worth correcting in both plenary and summary dispositions.  None of this converts discretionary, error-noticing review into mandatory, error-correcting review.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Likewise, the Michigan Court of Appeals is not required to hear particular cases or correct particular errors.  It may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition questionable or dubious.  Or it may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition important or interesting.  For all we know, it may (and probably does) consider both.  Regardless, the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant review remains &#x93;discretionary,&#x94; because it does not depend on &#x93;whether there has been &#x91;a correct adjudication of guilt&#x92; in every individual case.&#x94;

				The majority appears to dispute that review before the Michigan Court of Appeals is truly discretionary,

				, at 542&#x96;543, 614 N. W. 2d, at 125 (Cavanagh, J., dissenting) (&#x93;Nothing in our court rules or statute precludes the Court of Appeals from denying leave even though it may believe that the trial court&#x92;s decision was incorrect&#x94;).  So far as we can tell, the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant or deny a leave application is not constrained by any state constitutional provision, statute, or court rule.  The Michigan Court of Appeals may deny leave for any reason, or for no reason at all.

And  even assuming the Michigan courts have special difficulty, it is unlikely any marginal gains will offset the harms wrought by the majority&#x92;s preference for redistributing resources to a set of generally less meritorious claims.

The Court is wrong in each respect.

        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The majority claims that &#x93;[a]t the time he entered his plea, Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel he could elect to forgo.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  This assertion apparently refers to the Michigan statute, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000).  At the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, the statute provided that, if a defendant was convicted by plea, he generally could not receive appointed appellate counsel.  The majority&#x92;s reasoning is flawed for at least three reasons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the statement that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, is either incorrect or irrelevant.  If (as we must) we view the waiver decision from the perspective of Halbert and other defendants 
				<em>
					before entering a plea
				</em>
				, the statement is wrong as a matter of Michigan law.  The Michigan Court Rules applicable at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea explicitly provided that he was entitled to appointed appellate counsel if convicted following a trial.  Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(F)(1)(b) (Lexis 2001) (&#x93;In a case involving a conviction following a trial, if the defendant is indigent, the court must enter an order appointing a lawyer if the request is filed within 42 days after sentencing or within the time for filing an appeal of right&#x94;).  Michigan law thus gave Halbert, before entering a plea, the choice either to proceed to trial and guarantee himself appointed appellate counsel, or to plead guilty or no contest and forgo appointed appellate counsel in most circumstances.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Alternately, by stating that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, the majority might mean that Michigan law afforded Halbert no right to appointed appellate counsel following a plea-based conviction.  If so, the statement is true but irrelevant.  Of course Michigan law did not afford Halbert a right to appointed counsel once he pleaded no contest to the charged crimes.  But the question is whether, by pleading no contest with knowledge of the condition (no paid counsel on appeal), Halbert accepted the condition and thereby waived his right to paid counsel on appeal.  In other words, the question is whether Halbert had no right to counsel following his plea, because he had elected to forgo the right 
				<em>
					by pleading
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even if the majority were correct about Michigan law, that is beside the point.  At issue here is whether Halbert waived any federal constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				right to appointed appellate counsel he might have enjoyed.  Whether Michigan law provides for such counsel says nothing about whether a defendant possesses (and hence can waive) a federal constitutional right to that effect.  That Michigan, as a matter of state law, prohibited Halbert from receiving appointed appellate counsel if he pleaded guilty or no contest, is irrelevant to whether Halbert had (and could waive) an independent federal constitutional right to such counsel.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the majority implies that if the existence of a right to paid appellate counsel had been something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized&#x94; at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, then the right would have been waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  What this cryptic statement means is unclear.  But it cannot possibly mean that only rights that have been explicitly and uniformly recognized by statute or case law may be waived.  If that is what the statement means, then the majority has outlawed all conditional waivers (ones in which a defendant agrees that, if he has such a right, he waives it).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I take it instead that the reference to rights that are something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized,&#x94; and hence waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, means not just rights that are uniformly recognized, but also rights whose existence is unsettled.  If this understanding of the majority&#x92;s rule is correct, then the rule does not justify its claim that the constitutional right at issue was wholly unrecognized.  In fact, the existence of such a right was unsettled when Halbert entered his plea.  By that date, November 7, 2001, the Michigan Supreme Court had issued 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103, sustaining over a vigorous dissent the practice of denying the appointment of appellate counsel on application for leave to appeal a plea-based conviction; and a Federal District Court had enjoined Michigan state judges from denying the appointment of appellate counsel to indigents pursuant to the state statute, on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional, 
				<em>
					Tesmer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Kowalski
				</em>
				, 114 F. Supp. 2d 622, 625&#x96;629 (ED Mich. 2000).  The majority appears to focus on the fact that Michigan law did not afford defendants this right, but, again, state law is irrelevant to whether they possessed a federal constitutional right.  The existence of that right was unsettled
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea; hence, on what I take to
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				be the majority&#x92;s own terms, the right should have been waivable.

				The majority attempts to deflect this criticism by saying that &#x93;nothing in Halbert&#x92;s plea colloquy indicates that he waived an &#x91;unsettled&#x92; &#x2026; but assumed right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel, post-plea.&#x94;

				<em>

				To understand why the Court&#x92;s holding is an unwarranted extension of our precedents, it is necessary first to understand the limits that Michigan places on the provision of court-appointed counsel for defendants who plead guilty or no contest.  Before 1994, Michigan afforded all criminal defendants the right to appeal their convictions to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  By the early 1990&#x92;s, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals had a backlog of thousands of cases awaiting decision, nearly a third of which were appeals by defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.

				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 504, 614 N. W. 2d 103, 107 (2000).  To reduce this backlog, Michigan voters amended the Michigan Constitution in 1994 to provide that &#x93;[i]n every criminal prosecution, the accused shall &#x2026; have an appeal as a matter of right, except [that] &#x2026; an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich. Const., Art. 1, &#xA7;20; 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 107.  This constitutional amendment created a two-track system for Michigan defendants: The Michigan Court of Appeals must hear the appeals of those who dispute their guilt, while it may elect to hear the appeals of those who concede or do not contest their guilt of the substantive crime.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In 1999, the Michigan Legislature enacted the statute at issue here.  It provides that, in general, a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence.&#x94;  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(1) (West 2000).  Defendants who plead guilty or no contest do not, however, invariably lose the right to counsel on appeal; the statute contains exceptions to the general rule.  The trial court must appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants if the State seeks leave to appeal, the defendant&#x92;s sentence exceeds the upper limit of the applicable minimum guidelines range, or the defendant seeks leave to appeal a conditional plea.  &#xA7;770.3a(2).  Further, the trial court may appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants who seek leave to appeal certain sentencing errors.  &#xA7;770.3a(3).  Finally, if the Court of Appeals grants leave to appeal, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right,&#x94; Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(3) (2005), and the plea-convicted defendant is entitled to appointed counsel, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Thus, plea-convicted defendants lack appellate counsel only in certain types of cases, and only then when they are seeking leave to appeal.

				The majority nevertheless holds that Michigan&#x92;s system is constitutionally inadequate.  It finds that all plea-convicted indigent defendants have the right to appellate counsel when seeking leave to appeal.

				Far from being an &#x93;arbitrary&#x94; or &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; distinction, Michigan&#x92;s differentiation between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea is sensible.  First and perhaps foremost, the danger of wrongful convictions is less significant than in 
				<em>
					Douglas

				.  In 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, California preliminarily denied counsel to all indigent defendants, regardless of whether they maintained their innocence at trial or conceded their guilt by plea.

        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[p]lea proceedings are also shorter, simpler, and more routine than trials; the record most often consists of the &#x91;factual basis&#x92; for the plea that is provided to the trial court.

				The brief history of Michigan&#x92;s system confirms this.  When Michigan voters amended the State Constitution to establish the current system, roughly 13,000 civil and criminal appeals per year clogged the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; docket.  Of those, nearly a third were appeals by criminal defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.  Even though at the time plea-convicted defendants were appointed paid appellate counsel, few of these defendants were granted relief on appeal.  Simply put, Michigan&#x92;s bar and bench were devoting a substantial portion of their scarce resources to thousands of cases with little practical effect.  Reallocating resources was not &#x93;invidious discrimination&#x94; against criminal defendants, indigent or otherwise.

				Today&#x92;s decision will therefore do no favors for indigent defendants in Michigan&#x97;at least, indigent defendants with nonfrivolous claims.  While defendants who admit their guilt will receive more attention, defendants who maintain their innocence will receive less.  Even some defendants who plead guilty will feel the pinch, because plea-convicted defendants are entitled to counsel in preparing their leave applications if, for example, they appeal from conditional pleas, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(d) (2005), or their sentences exceed the applicable guidelines ranges, &#xA7;770.3a(2)(b).  And any plea-convicted defendant granted leave to appeal is entitled to appointed counsel.  &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Holding Michigan&#x92;s resources constant (since we have no control over the State&#x92;s bar or budget), the majority&#x92;s policy choice to redistribute the State&#x92;s limited resources only harms those most likely to have worthwhile claims&#x97;to say nothing of &#x93;the cost of enabling courts and prosecutors to respond to the &#x91;over-lawyering&#x92; of minor cases.&#x94;

				The Michigan Court of Appeals probably does consider &#x93;the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; in exercising its discretion; so do other courts of discretionary review, including this Court.  For instance, this Court would be unlikely to grant a case to announce a rule that could not alter the case&#x92;s disposition, or to correct an error that had not affected the proceedings below.  This Court often considers whether errors are worth correcting in both plenary and summary dispositions.  None of this converts discretionary, error-noticing review into mandatory, error-correcting review.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Likewise, the Michigan Court of Appeals is not required to hear particular cases or correct particular errors.  It may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition questionable or dubious.  Or it may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition important or interesting.  For all we know, it may (and probably does) consider both.  Regardless, the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant review remains &#x93;discretionary,&#x94; because it does not depend on &#x93;whether there has been &#x91;a correct adjudication of guilt&#x92; in every individual case.&#x94;

				The majority appears to dispute that review before the Michigan Court of Appeals is truly discretionary,

So far as we can tell, the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant or deny a leave application is not constrained by any state constitutional provision, statute, or court rule.  The Michigan Court of Appeals may deny leave for any reason, or for no reason at all.

				Lacking support in this Court&#x92;s cases, the majority effects a not-so-subtle shift from whether the record is adequate to enable discretionary review to whether plea-convicted defendants are generally able to &#x93;[n]aviga[te] the appellate process without a lawyer&#x92;s assistance.&#x94;

And  even assuming the Michigan courts have special difficulty, it is unlikely any marginal gains will offset the harms wrought by the majority&#x92;s preference for redistributing resources to a set of generally less meritorious claims.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				The majority claims that &#x93;[a]t the time he entered his plea, Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel he could elect to forgo.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  This assertion apparently refers to the Michigan statute, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a (West 2000).  At the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, the statute provided that, if a defendant was convicted by plea, he generally could not receive appointed appellate counsel.  The majority&#x92;s reasoning is flawed for at least three reasons.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, the statement that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, is either incorrect or irrelevant.  If (as we must) we view the waiver decision from the perspective of Halbert and other defendants 
				<em>
					before entering a plea
				</em>
				, the statement is wrong as a matter of Michigan law.  The Michigan Court Rules applicable at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea explicitly provided that he was entitled to appointed appellate counsel if convicted following a trial.  Mich. Ct. Rule 6.425(F)(1)(b) (Lexis 2001) (&#x93;In a case involving a conviction following a trial, if the defendant is indigent, the court must enter an order appointing a lawyer if the request is filed within 42 days after sentencing or within the time for filing an appeal of right&#x94;).  Michigan law thus gave Halbert, before entering a plea, the choice either to proceed to trial and guarantee himself appointed appellate counsel, or to plead guilty or no contest and forgo appointed appellate counsel in most circumstances.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Alternately, by stating that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, the majority might mean that Michigan law afforded Halbert no right to appointed appellate counsel following a plea-based conviction.  If so, the statement is true but irrelevant.  Of course Michigan law did not afford Halbert a right to appointed counsel once he pleaded no contest to the charged crimes.  But the question is whether, by pleading no contest with knowledge of the condition (no paid counsel on appeal), Halbert accepted the condition and thereby waived his right to paid counsel on appeal.  In other words, the question is whether Halbert had no right to counsel following his plea, because he had elected to forgo the right 
				<em>
					by pleading
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even if the majority were correct about Michigan law, that is beside the point.  At issue here is whether Halbert waived any federal constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				right to appointed appellate counsel he might have enjoyed.  Whether Michigan law provides for such counsel says nothing about whether a defendant possesses (and hence can waive) a federal constitutional right to that effect.  That Michigan, as a matter of state law, prohibited Halbert from receiving appointed appellate counsel if he pleaded guilty or no contest, is irrelevant to whether Halbert had (and could waive) an independent federal constitutional right to such counsel.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the majority implies that if the existence of a right to paid appellate counsel had been something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized&#x94; at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, then the right would have been waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  What this cryptic statement means is unclear.  But it cannot possibly mean that only rights that have been explicitly and uniformly recognized by statute or case law may be waived.  If that is what the statement means, then the majority has outlawed all conditional waivers (ones in which a defendant agrees that, if he has such a right, he waives it).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I take it instead that the reference to rights that are something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized,&#x94; and hence waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, means not just rights that are uniformly recognized, but also rights whose existence is unsettled.  If this understanding of the majority&#x92;s rule is correct, then the rule does not justify its claim that the constitutional right at issue was wholly unrecognized.  In fact, the existence of such a right was unsettled when Halbert entered his plea.  By that date, November 7, 2001, the Michigan Supreme Court had issued 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103, sustaining over a vigorous dissent the practice of denying the appointment of appellate counsel on application for leave to appeal a plea-based conviction; and a Federal District Court had enjoined Michigan state judges from denying the appointment of appellate counsel to indigents pursuant to the state statute, on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional,

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Kowalski
				</em>
				, 114 F. Supp. 2d 622, 625&#x96;629 (ED Mich. 2000).  The majority appears to focus on the fact that Michigan law did not afford defendants this right, but, again, state law is irrelevant to whether they possessed a federal constitutional right.  The existence of that right was unsettled
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea; hence, on what I take to

				be the majority&#x92;s own terms, the right should have been waivable.

				The majority attempts to deflect this criticism by saying that &#x93;nothing in Halbert&#x92;s plea colloquy indicates that he waived an &#x91;unsettled&#x92; &#x2026; but assumed right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel, post-plea.&#x94;

				To understand why the Court&#x92;s holding is an unwarranted extension of our precedents, it is necessary first to understand the limits that Michigan places on the provision of court-appointed counsel for defendants who plead guilty or no contest.  Before 1994, Michigan afforded all criminal defendants the right to appeal their convictions to the Michigan Court of Appeals.  By the early 1990&#x92;s, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals had a backlog of thousands of cases awaiting decision, nearly a third of which were appeals by defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.

				 v. 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 504, 614 N. W. 2d 103, 107 (2000).  To reduce this backlog, Michigan voters amended the Michigan Constitution in 1994 to provide that &#x93;[i]n every criminal prosecution, the accused shall &#x2026; have an appeal as a matter of right, except [that] &#x2026; an appeal by an accused who pleads guilty or nolo contendere shall be by leave of the court.&#x94;  Mich. Const., Art. 1, &#xA7;20; 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 504, 614 N. W. 2d, at 107.  This constitutional amendment created a two-track system for Michigan defendants: The Michigan Court of Appeals must hear the appeals of those who dispute their guilt, while it may elect to hear the appeals of those who concede or do not contest their guilt of the substantive crime.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In 1999, the Michigan Legislature enacted the statute at issue here.  It provides that, in general, a &#x93;defendant who pleads guilty, guilty but mentally ill, or nolo contendere shall not have appellate counsel appointed for review of the defendant&#x92;s conviction or sentence.&#x94;  Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(1) (West 2000).  Defendants who plead guilty or no contest do not, however, invariably lose the right to counsel on appeal; the statute contains exceptions to the general rule.  The trial court must appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants if the State seeks leave to appeal, the defendant&#x92;s sentence exceeds the upper limit of the applicable minimum guidelines range, or the defendant seeks leave to appeal a conditional plea.  &#xA7;770.3a(2).  Further, the trial court may appoint appellate counsel for plea-convicted defendants who seek leave to appeal certain sentencing errors.  &#xA7;770.3a(3).  Finally, if the Court of Appeals grants leave to appeal, &#x93;the case proceeds as an appeal of right,&#x94; Mich. Ct. Rule 7.205(D)(3) (2005), and the plea-convicted defendant is entitled to appointed counsel, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Thus, plea-convicted defendants lack appellate counsel only in certain types of cases, and only then when they are seeking leave to appeal.

				The majority nevertheless holds that Michigan&#x92;s system is constitutionally inadequate.  It finds that all plea-convicted indigent defendants have the right to appellate counsel when seeking leave to appeal.  The majority does not say where in the Constitution that right is located&#x97;the Due Process Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, or some purported confluence of the two.

				<em>

				 condemns.  Michigan has done no more than recognize the undeniable difference between defendants who plead guilty and those who maintain their innocence, in an attempt to divert resources from largely frivolous appeals to more meritorious ones.

				Far from being an &#x93;arbitrary&#x94; or &#x93;unreasoned&#x94; distinction, Michigan&#x92;s differentiation between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea is sensible.  First and perhaps foremost, the danger of wrongful convictions is less significant than in 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				.  In 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, California preliminarily denied counsel to all indigent defendants, regardless of whether they maintained their innocence at trial or conceded their guilt by plea.  Here, Michigan preliminarily denies paid counsel only to indigent defendants who admit or do not contest their guilt.

        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[p]lea proceedings are also shorter, simpler, and more routine than trials; the record most often consists of the &#x91;factual basis&#x92; for the plea that is provided to the trial court.

				The brief history of Michigan&#x92;s system confirms this.  When Michigan voters amended the State Constitution to establish the current system, roughly 13,000 civil and criminal appeals per year clogged the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; docket.  Of those, nearly a third were appeals by criminal defendants who had pleaded guilty or no contest.  Even though at the time plea-convicted defendants were appointed paid appellate counsel, few of these defendants were granted relief on appeal.  Simply put, Michigan&#x92;s bar and bench were devoting a substantial portion of their scarce resources to thousands of cases with little practical effect.  Reallocating resources was not &#x93;invidious discrimination&#x94; against criminal defendants, indigent or otherwise.

				Today&#x92;s decision will therefore do no favors for indigent defendants in Michigan&#x97;at least, indigent defendants with nonfrivolous claims.  While defendants who admit their guilt will receive more attention, defendants who maintain their innocence will receive less.  Even some defendants who plead guilty will feel the pinch, because plea-convicted defendants are entitled to counsel in preparing their leave applications if, for example, they appeal from conditional pleas, Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. &#xA7;770.3a(2)(d) (2005), or their sentences exceed the applicable guidelines ranges, &#xA7;770.3a(2)(b).  And any plea-convicted defendant granted leave to appeal is entitled to appointed counsel.  &#xA7;770.3a(2)(c).  Holding Michigan&#x92;s resources constant (since we have no control over the State&#x92;s bar or budget), the majority&#x92;s policy choice to redistribute the State&#x92;s limited resources only harms those most likely to have worthwhile claims&#x97;to say nothing of &#x93;the cost of enabling courts and prosecutors to respond to the &#x91;over-lawyering&#x92; of minor cases.&#x94;

				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Michigan Court of Appeals probably does consider &#x93;the merits of the applicant&#x92;s claims&#x94; in exercising its discretion; so do other courts of discretionary review, including this Court.  For instance, this Court would be unlikely to grant a case to announce a rule that could not alter the case&#x92;s disposition, or to correct an error that had not affected the proceedings below.  This Court often considers whether errors are worth correcting in both plenary and summary dispositions.  None of this converts discretionary, error-noticing review into mandatory, error-correcting review.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Likewise, the Michigan Court of Appeals is not required to hear particular cases or correct particular errors.  It may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition questionable or dubious.  Or it may elect to hear cases when it finds the trial court&#x92;s disposition important or interesting.  For all we know, it may (and probably does) consider both.  Regardless, the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant review remains &#x93;discretionary,&#x94; because it does not depend on &#x93;whether there has been &#x91;a correct adjudication of guilt&#x92; in every individual case.&#x94;

				The majority appears to dispute that review before the Michigan Court of Appeals is truly discretionary,

So far as we can tell, the Michigan Court of Appeals&#x92; decision to grant or deny a leave application is not constrained by any state constitutional provision, statute, or court rule.  The Michigan Court of Appeals may deny leave for any reason, or for no reason at all.

Michigan law thus gave Halbert, before entering a plea, the choice either to proceed to trial and guarantee himself appointed appellate counsel, or to plead guilty or no contest and forgo appointed appellate counsel in most circumstances.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Alternately, by stating that &#x93;Halbert, in common with other defendants convicted on their pleas, had no recognized right to appointed appellate counsel,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, the majority might mean that Michigan law afforded Halbert no right to appointed appellate counsel following a plea-based conviction.  If so, the statement is true but irrelevant.  Of course Michigan law did not afford Halbert a right to appointed counsel once he pleaded no contest to the charged crimes.  But the question is whether, by pleading no contest with knowledge of the condition (no paid counsel on appeal), Halbert accepted the condition and thereby waived his right to paid counsel on appeal.  In other words, the question is whether Halbert had no right to counsel following his plea, because he had elected to forgo the right 
				<em>
					by pleading
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, even if the majority were correct about Michigan law, that is beside the point.  At issue here is whether Halbert waived any federal constitutional
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				right to appointed appellate counsel he might have enjoyed.  Whether Michigan law provides for such counsel says nothing about whether a defendant possesses (and hence can waive) a federal constitutional right to that effect.  That Michigan, as a matter of state law, prohibited Halbert from receiving appointed appellate counsel if he pleaded guilty or no contest, is irrelevant to whether Halbert had (and could waive) an independent federal constitutional right to such counsel.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the majority implies that if the existence of a right to paid appellate counsel had been something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized&#x94; at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea, then the right would have been waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16.  What this cryptic statement means is unclear.  But it cannot possibly mean that only rights that have been explicitly and uniformly recognized by statute or case law may be waived.  If that is what the statement means, then the majority has outlawed all conditional waivers (ones in which a defendant agrees that, if he has such a right, he waives it).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I take it instead that the reference to rights that are something more than &#x93;no[t] recognized,&#x94; and hence waivable, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 16, means not just rights that are uniformly recognized, but also rights whose existence is unsettled.  If this understanding of the majority&#x92;s rule is correct, then the rule does not justify its claim that the constitutional right at issue was wholly unrecognized.  In fact, the existence of such a right was unsettled when Halbert entered his plea.  By that date, November 7, 2001, the Michigan Supreme Court had issued 
				<em>
					Bulger
				</em>
				, 462 Mich. 495, 614 N. W. 2d 103, sustaining over a vigorous dissent the practice of denying the appointment of appellate counsel on application for leave to appeal a plea-based conviction; and a Federal District Court had enjoined Michigan state judges from denying the appointment of appellate counsel to indigents pursuant to the state statute, on the ground that the statute was unconstitutional, 
				<em>
					Tesmer
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Kowalski
				</em>
				, 114 F. Supp. 2d 622, 625&#x96;629 (ED Mich. 2000).  The majority appears to focus on the fact that Michigan law did not afford defendants this right, but, again, state law is irrelevant to whether they possessed a federal constitutional right.  The existence of that right was unsettled
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				at the time of Halbert&#x92;s plea; hence, on what I take to
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				be the majority&#x92;s own terms, the right should have been waivable.

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The majority attempts to deflect this criticism by saying that &#x93;nothing in Halbert&#x92;s plea colloquy indicates that he waived an &#x91;unsettled&#x92; &#x2026; but assumed right to the assistance of appointed appellate counsel, post-plea.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 16, n. 7.  But any arguable inadequacy in the plea colloquy is a separate issue from, and is irrelevant to, the question at hand: whether the right was recognized, and hence waivable by Halbert (or any other defendant deciding how to plead), irrespective of the content of the plea colloquy.

				The majority compounds its error by expressing doubt in dictum that the right to appointed appellate counsel can be waived.  
				<em>

				513 U. S., at 200&#x96;201; 
				<em>
					Hill
				</em>
				, 528 U. S., at 114.  By ignoring the presumption, the majority effectively reverses it, espousing an analysis that is &#x93;directly contrary to the approach we have taken in the context of a broad array of constitutional and statutory provisions.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Mezzanatto, supra,
				</em>
				 at 200.  For the proposition that Michigan&#x92;s waiver requirement is unconstitutional, the majority cites 
				<em>
					Douglas
				</em>
				, 372 U. S., at 357&#x96;358, and 
				<em>
					M.
				</em>
            <em>

				<em>

				, at 17, n. 8.  These cases have nothing to do with waiver; they determined only that certain rights existed, not that they both existed 
				<em>

				.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The majority seems to think that Michigan&#x92;s waiver requirement arbitrarily distinguishes between indigents and more affluent persons.  As I have explained, however, the statute does no such thing.  Rather, it sensibly differentiates between defendants convicted at trial and defendants convicted by plea.

				In this case, the plea colloquy shows that Halbert&#x92;s waiver was knowing and intelligent, and that any deficiency in the plea colloquy was harmless.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2111.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;2111</a>; cf. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(h).  First, Halbert understood he was waiving any appeal as of right: The trial court asked Halbert, &#x93;You understand if I accept your plea you are giving up or waiving any claim of an appeal as of right,&#x94; and Halbert answered &#x93;Yes, sir.&#x94;  App. 22.  Second, the court explained the statutory exceptions governing when counsel must or might be appointed, and Halbert again indicated that he understood those conditions.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 7 (quoting colloquy).  In context, the court&#x92;s enumeration of the limited conditions in which counsel might be appointed informed Halbert that counsel would not be appointed in other circumstances.  Third, at the end of the colloquy, the court asked counsel, &#x93;Any other promises or considerations I should be made aware of?&#x94; App. 24, and &#x93;Do counsel believe I&#x92;ve complied with the court rule regarding no contest pleas?&#x94; 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 25, both of which questions the prosecutor and defense attorney answered in the affirmative.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Bradshaw
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Stumpf
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					ante,
				</em>
				 at 7 (&#x93;Where a defendant is represented by competent counsel, the court usually may rely on that counsel&#x92;s assurance that the defendant has been properly informed of the nature and elements of the charge to which he is pleading guilty&#x94;).  Fourth, the court &#x93;f[ound] the plea understandingly made, voluntary and accurate.&#x94;  App. 25.  There can be no serious claim that Halbert would have changed his plea had the court provided further information.

				Today the Court confers on defendants convicted by plea a right nowhere to be found in the Constitution or this Court&#x92;s cases.  It does so at the expense of defendants whose claims are, on average, likely more meritorious.  And it ignores that, even if such a right exists, it is fully waivable and was waived in this case.

						 Moreover, the majority&#x92;s failure to make clear which sources of law are to be considered in deciding whether a right is &#x93;no[t] recognized,&#x94; ante, at 16, and hence nonwaivable, is bound to wreak havoc.  For instance, suppose that a defendant waived the right to appeal his sentence after the regional Court of Appeals had held that the principle of Blakely v. Washington, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/296" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 296</a> (2004)
, did not apply to the United States Sentencing Guidelines, but before this Court held the contrary in United States v. Booker, 543 U. S. ___ (2005).  The defendant could claim that, in his circuit, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a> right against the application of the Guidelines was &#x93;no[t] recognized,&#x94; and hence that the right was nonwaivable.
