				Respondent Nixon was arrested for a brutal murder.  Questioned by the police, Nixon described in graphic detail how he had kidnaped and killed his victim.  After gathering overwhelming evidence of his guilt, the State indicted Nixon for first-degree murder and related crimes.  Assistant public defender Corin, assigned to represent Nixon, filed a plea of not guilty and deposed all of the State&#x92;s potential witnesses.  Satisfied that Nixon&#x92;s guilt was not subject to reasonable dispute, Corin commenced plea negotiations, but the prosecutors refused to recommend a sentence other than death.  Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, and a strong case for the prosecution, Corin concluded that his best course would be to concede Nixon&#x92;s guilt, thereby preserving credibility for penalty phase evidence of Nixon's mental instability, and for defense pleas to spare Nixon&#x92;s life.  Corin several times attempted to explain this strategy to Nixon, but Nixon remained unresponsive, never verbally approving or protesting the proposed strategy.  Overall, Nixon gave Corin very little, if any, assistance or direction in preparing the case.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				When trial began, Nixon engaged in disruptive behavior and absented himself from most of the proceedings.  In his opening statement, Corin acknowledged Nixon&#x92;s guilt and urged the jury to focus on the penalty phase.  During the State&#x92;s case in chief, Corin objected to the introduction of crime scene photographs as unduly prejudicial, cross-examined witnesses for clarification, and contested several aspects of the jury instructions.  In his closing argument, Corin again conceded Nixon&#x92;s guilt, declaring that he hoped to persuade the jury during the penalty phase that Nixon should not be sentenced to death.  The jury found Nixon guilty on all counts.  At the penalty phase, Corin argued to the jury that Nixon was not &#x93;an intact human being&#x94; and had committed the murder while afflicted with multiple mental disabilities.  Corin called as witnesses relatives and friends who described Nixon&#x92;s childhood emotional troubles and his erratic behavior preceding the murder.  Corin also presented expert testimony concerning Nixon&#x92;s antisocial personality, history of emotional instability and psychiatric care, low IQ, and possible brain damage.  In his closing argument, Corin emphasized Nixon&#x92;s youth, the psychiatric evidence, and the jury&#x92;s discretion to consider any mitigating circumstances; urged that, if not sentenced to death, Nixon would never be released; maintained that the death penalty was not appropriate for a person with Nixon&#x92;s impairments; and asked the jury to spare Nixon&#x92;s life.  The jury recommended, and the trial court imposed, the death penalty.

				The Florida Supreme Court ultimately reversed, holding that a defense attorney&#x92;s concession that his client committed murder, made without the defendant&#x92;s express consent, automatically ranks as prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitating a new trial under the standard announced in 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Cronic,
				</em>
				 466 U. S 648.  Corin&#x92;s concession, according to that court, was the functional equivalent of a guilty plea in that it allowed the prosecution&#x92;s guilt-phase case to proceed essentially without opposition.  Under

S. 238</a>, consent to a guilty plea cannot be inferred from silence; similarly, the Florida court stated, a concession of guilt at trial requires a defendant&#x92;s affirmative, explicit acceptance, without which counsel&#x92;s performance is presumably inadequate.  While acknowledging that Nixon was very disruptive and uncooperative at trial and that Corin&#x92;s strategy may have been in Nixon&#x92;s best interest, the court nevertheless declared that silent acquiescence is not enough: Counsel conceding a defendant&#x92;s guilt is inevitably ineffective if the defendant does not expressly approve counsel&#x92;s course.

				(a) The Florida Supreme Court erred in requiring Nixon&#x92;s affirmative, explicit acceptance of Corin&#x92;s strategy because it mistakenly deemed Corin&#x92;s statements to the jury the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.  Despite Corin&#x92;s concession of Nixon&#x92;s guilt, Nixon retained the rights accorded a defendant in a criminal trial.  Cf. 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 242&#x96;243, and n. 4.  The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  Further, the defense reserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence.  Futhermore, in the event of errors in the trial or jury instructions, a concession of guilt would not hinder the defendant&#x92;s right to appeal.  Corin was obliged to, and in fact several times did, explain his proposed trial strategy to Nixon.  Nixon&#x92;s characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him did not suffice to render unreasonable Corin&#x92;s decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.  Pp. 10&#x96;12.

The court first presumed deficient performance, then applied the presumption of prejudice that

				reserved for situations in which counsel has entirely failed to function as the client&#x92;s advocate, 466 U. S., at 659.  Corin&#x92;s concession of Nixon&#x92;s guilt does not rank as such a failure.

				</em>
				 Although a concession of guilt in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceeding&#x92;s two-phase structure vitally affect counsel&#x92;s strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies: Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.  Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trial&#x92;s penalty phase, at which time counsel&#x92;s mission is to persuade the trier that his client&#x92;s life should be spared.  Defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  Mounting a &#x93;defendant did not commit the crime&#x94; defense risks destroying counsel&#x92;s penalty phase credibility and may incline the jury against leniency for the defendant.  In a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed.  When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendant&#x92;s best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsel&#x92;s strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendant&#x92;s explicit consent.  Instead, if counsel&#x92;s strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendant&#x92;s guilt, satisfies the 
				<em>

				</em>
				 standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.  Pp. 12&#x96;16.

				This capital case concerns defense counsel&#x92;s strategic decision to concede, at the guilt phase of the trial, the defendant&#x92;s commission of murder, and to concentrate the defense on establishing, at the penalty phase, cause for sparing the defendant&#x92;s life.  Any concession of that order, the Florida Supreme Court held, made without the defendant&#x92;s express consent&#x97;however gruesome the crime and despite the strength of the evidence of guilt&#x97;automatically ranks as prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitating a new trial.  We reverse the Florida Supreme Court&#x92;s judgment.

				Defense counsel undoubtedly has a duty to discuss potential strategies with the defendant.  See

.  But when a defendant, informed by counsel, neither consents nor objects to the course counsel describes as the most promising means to avert a sentence of death, counsel is not automatically barred from pursuing that course.  The reasonableness of counsel&#x92;s performance, after consultation with the defendant yields no response, must be judged in accord with the inquiry generally applicable to ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims: Did counsel&#x92;s representation &#x93;f[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness&#x94;?

				In late August 1984, Nixon was indicted in Leon County, Florida, for first-degree murder, kidnaping, robbery, and arson.  See App. 1, 55.  Assistant public defender Michael Corin, assigned to represent Nixon, see 
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 232, filed a plea of not guilty,

				  Corin thereupon commenced plea negotiations, hoping to persuade the prosecution to drop the death penalty in exchange for Nixon&#x92;s guilty pleas to all charges.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, Corin turned his attention to the penalty phase, believing that the only way to save Nixon&#x92;s life would be to present extensive mitigation evidence centering on Nixon&#x92;s mental instability.  
				<em>
					Id.,

				 at 261, 473; see also 
				<em>

				, at 102.  Experienced in capital defense, see 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 248&#x96;250, Corin feared that denying Nixon&#x92;s commission of the kidnaping and murder during the guilt phase would compromise Corin&#x92;s ability to persuade the jury, during the penalty phase, that Nixon&#x92;s conduct was the product of his mental illness.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 473, 490, 505.  Corin concluded that the best strategy would be to concede guilt, thereby preserving his credibility in urging leniency during the penalty phase.

				When Nixon&#x92;s trial began on July 15, 1985, his unresponsiveness deepened into disruptive and violent behavior.  On the second day of jury selection, Nixon pulled off his clothing, demanded a black judge and lawyer, refused to be escorted into the courtroom, and threatened to force the guards to shoot him.

				, 572 So. 2d, at 1341; 10 Record 1934&#x96;1935.  An extended on-the-record colloquy followed Nixon&#x92;s bizarre behavior, during which Corin urged the trial judge to explain Nixon&#x92;s rights to him and ascertain whether Nixon understood the significance of absenting himself from the trial.  Corin also argued that restraining Nixon and compelling him to be present would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury.

				During its case in chief, the State introduced the tape of Nixon&#x92;s confession, expert testimony on the manner in which Bickner died, and witness testimony regarding Nixon&#x92;s confessions to his relatives and his possession of Bickner&#x92;s car and personal effects.  Corin cross-examined these witnesses only when he felt their statements needed clarification, see,

The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  See 
				<em>

The two evidentiary hearings conducted by the Florida trial court demonstrate beyond doubt that Corin fulfilled his duty of consultation by informing Nixon of counsel&#x92;s proposed strategy and its potential benefits.  Nixon&#x92;s characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him, in sum, did not suffice to render unreasonable Corin&#x92;s decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.

				The Florida Supreme Court&#x92;s erroneous equation of Corin&#x92;s concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply the wrong standard in determining whether counsel&#x92;s performance ranked as ineffective assistance.

				On the record thus far developed, Corin&#x92;s concession of Nixon&#x92;s guilt does not rank as a &#x93;fail[ure] to function in any meaningful sense as the Government&#x92;s adversary.&#x94;

				 Although such a concession in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceeding&#x92;s two-phase structure vitally affect counsel&#x92;s strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the defendant&#x92;s guilt is often clear.  Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.

				Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trial&#x92;s penalty phase, at which time counsel&#x92;s mission is to persuade the trier that his client&#x92;s life should be spared.  Unable to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence, defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  See Lyon, Defending the Death Penalty Case: What Makes Death Different?, 42 Mercer L. Rev. 695, 708 (1991) (&#x93;It is not good to put on a &#x91;he didn&#x92;t do it&#x92; defense and a &#x91;he is sorry he did it&#x92; mitigation.  This just does not work.

				To summarize, in a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed.  When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendant&#x92;s best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsel&#x92;s strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendant&#x92;s explicit consent.  Instead, if counsel&#x92;s strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendant&#x92;s guilt, satisfies the Strickland
				 standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.

Singletary, 758 So. 2d 618, 625 (Fla. 2000) (per curiam) (evidence of guilt was &#x93;overwhelming&#x94;); State v. Nixon, Case No. 84&#x96;2324 (Fla. Cir.

						 In his brief before this Court, Nixon describes inconsistencies in the State&#x92;s evidence at the guilt phase of the trial.  See Brief for Respondent 13&#x96;22.  Corin&#x92;s failure to explore these inconsistencies, measured against the Strickland standard, 466 U. S., at 690, Nixon maintains, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The Florida Supreme Court did not address the alleged inconsistencies and we decline to consider the matter in the first instance.

						 As Corin determined here, pleading guilty without a guarantee that the prosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little if any benefit for the defendant.  See ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases &#xA7;10.9.2, Commentary (rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913, 1045 (2003) (&#x93;If no written guarantee can be obtained that death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be extremely reluctant to participate in a waiver of the client&#x92;s trial rights.&#x94;).  Pleading guilty not only relinquishes trial rights, it increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt during the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors&#x92; minds as they deliberate on the sentence.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 331 (1983); supra, at 7, 11.

				This capital case concerns defense counsel&#x92;s strategic decision to concede, at the guilt phase of the trial, the defendant&#x92;s commission of murder, and to concentrate the defense on establishing, at the penalty phase, cause for sparing the defendant&#x92;s life.  Any concession of that order, the Florida Supreme Court held, made without the defendant&#x92;s express consent&#x97;however gruesome the crime and despite the strength of the evidence of guilt&#x97;automatically ranks as prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitating a new trial.  We reverse the Florida Supreme Court&#x92;s judgment.

				Defense counsel undoubtedly has a duty to discuss potential strategies with the defendant.  See

.  But when a defendant, informed by counsel, neither consents nor objects to the course counsel describes as the most promising means to avert a sentence of death, counsel is not automatically barred from pursuing that course.  The reasonableness of counsel&#x92;s performance, after consultation with the defendant yields no response, must be judged in accord with the inquiry generally applicable to ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims: Did counsel&#x92;s representation &#x93;f[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness&#x94;?  
				<em>

				 at 688, 694.  The Florida Supreme Court erred in applying, instead, a presumption of deficient performance, as well as a presumption of prejudice; that latter presumption, we have instructed, is reserved for cases in which counsel fails meaningfully to oppose the prosecution&#x92;s case.

				The State gathered overwhelming evidence establishing that Nixon had committed the murder in the manner he described.

				In late August 1984, Nixon was indicted in Leon County, Florida, for first-degree murder, kidnaping, robbery, and arson.  See App. 1, 55.  Assistant public defender Michael Corin, assigned to represent Nixon, see 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 232, filed a plea of not guilty, 
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 468&#x96;469, and deposed all of the State&#x92;s potential witnesses, 
				<em>
					id.,

            </a>
				  Corin thereupon commenced plea negotiations, hoping to persuade the prosecution to drop the death penalty in exchange for Nixon&#x92;s guilty pleas to all charges.  
				<em>

				 at 339, 508.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, Corin turned his attention to the penalty phase, believing that the only way to save Nixon&#x92;s life would be to present extensive mitigation evidence centering on Nixon&#x92;s mental instability.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 261, 473; see also 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 102.  Experienced in capital defense, see 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 248&#x96;250, Corin feared that denying Nixon&#x92;s commission of the kidnaping and murder during the guilt phase would compromise Corin&#x92;s ability to persuade the jury, during the penalty phase, that Nixon&#x92;s conduct was the product of his mental illness.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 473, 490, 505.  Corin concluded that the best strategy would be to concede guilt, thereby preserving his credibility in urging leniency during the penalty phase.

				Corin attempted to explain this strategy to Nixon at least three times.

				 at 466&#x96;467, Nixon was generally unresponsive during their discussions,

				<em>

				 at 478, and refused to attend pretrial dispositions of various motions, 
				<em>
					Nixon I
				</em>
				, 572 So. 2d, at 1341; App.
				<em>

				When Nixon&#x92;s trial began on July 15, 1985, his unresponsiveness deepened into disruptive and violent behavior.  On the second day of jury selection, Nixon pulled off his clothing, demanded a black judge and lawyer, refused to be escorted into the courtroom, and threatened to force the guards to shoot him.  
				<em>
					Nixon I
				</em>
				, 572 So. 2d, at 1341; 10 Record 1934&#x96;1935.  An extended on-the-record colloquy followed Nixon&#x92;s bizarre behavior, during which Corin urged the trial judge to explain Nixon&#x92;s rights to him and ascertain whether Nixon understood the significance of absenting himself from the trial.  Corin also argued that restraining Nixon and compelling him to be present would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 1918&#x96;1920.  When the judge examined Nixon on the record in a holding cell, Nixon stated he had no interest in the trial and threatened to misbehave if forced to attend.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				&#x93;In this case, there won&#x92;t be any question, none whatsoever, that my client, Joe Elton Nixon, caused Jeannie Bickner&#x92;s death&#x2026; . [T]hat fact will be proved to your satisfaction beyond any doubt.

				During its case in chief, the State introduced the tape of Nixon&#x92;s confession, expert testimony on the manner in which Bickner died, and witness testimony regarding Nixon&#x92;s confessions to his relatives and his possession of Bickner&#x92;s car and personal effects.  Corin cross-examined these witnesses only when he felt their statements needed clarification, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 13 Record 2504, and he did not present a defense case, 20 
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 2470, and actively contested several aspects of the jury instructions during the charge conference, 11 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 2050&#x96;2058.  In his closing argument, Corin again conceded Nixon&#x92;s guilt, App. 73, and reminded the jury of the importance of the penalty phase: &#x93;I will hope to &#x2026; argue to you and give you reasons not that Mr. Nixon&#x92;s life be spared one final and terminal confinement forever, but that he not be sentenced to die,&#x94;

				<em>

				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 143&#x96;147; 162&#x96;166.  The State presented little evidence during the penalty phase, simply incorporating its guilt-phase evidence by reference, and introducing testimony, over Corin&#x92;s objection, that Nixon had removed Bickner&#x92;s underwear in order to terrorize her.

				The Florida Supreme Court, as just observed, see

				, at 9, required Nixon&#x92;s &#x93;affirmative, explicit acceptance&#x94; of Corin&#x92;s strategy because it deemed Corin&#x92;s statements to the jury &#x93;the functional equivalent of a guilty plea.&#x94;

				Despite Corin&#x92;s concession, Nixon retained the rights accorded a defendant in a criminal trial.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Boykin
				</em>
				, 395 U. S., at 242&#x96;243, and n. 4 (a guilty plea is &#x93;more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts,&#x94; it is a &#x93;stipulation that no proof by the prosecution need be advanced&#x94;).  The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4, 7.  Further, the defense reserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 6.  In addition, in the event of errors in the trial or jury instructions, a concession of guilt would not hinder the defendant&#x92;s right to appeal.

				Nixon nevertheless urges, relying on

				Corin was obliged to, and in fact several times did, explain his proposed trial strategy to Nixon.  See

				<em>
					Nixon III
				</em>
				, 857 So. 2d, at 187&#x96;188 (Wells, J., dissenting), Corin was not additionally required to gain express consent before conceding Nixon&#x92;s guilt.  The two evidentiary hearings conducted by the Florida trial court demonstrate beyond doubt that Corin fulfilled his duty of consultation by informing Nixon of counsel&#x92;s proposed strategy and its potential benefits.  Nixon&#x92;s characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him, in sum, did not suffice to render unreasonable Corin&#x92;s decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.

				The Florida Supreme Court&#x92;s erroneous equation of Corin&#x92;s concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply the wrong standard in determining whether counsel&#x92;s performance ranked as ineffective assistance.  The court first presumed deficient performance, then applied the presumption of prejudice that

, reserved for situations in which counsel has entirely failed to function as the client&#x92;s advocate.  The Florida court therefore did not hold Nixon to the standard prescribed in

				 v. 
				<em>

, which would have required Nixon to show that counsel&#x92;s concession strategy was unreasonable.  As Florida Supreme Court Justice Lewis observed, that court&#x92;s majority misunderstood

				 and failed to attend to the realities of defending against a capital charge.

				On the record thus far developed, Corin&#x92;s concession of Nixon&#x92;s guilt does not rank as a &#x93;fail[ure] to function in any meaningful sense as the Government&#x92;s adversary.&#x94;  
				<em>

				</em>
				 Although such a concession in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceeding&#x92;s two-phase structure vitally affect counsel&#x92;s strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the defendant&#x92;s guilt is often clear.  Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 329 (1983).

				Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trial&#x92;s penalty phase, at which time counsel&#x92;s mission is to persuade the trier that his client&#x92;s life should be spared.  Unable to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence, defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  See Lyon, Defending the Death Penalty Case: What Makes Death Different?, 42 Mercer L. Rev. 695, 708 (1991) (&#x93;It is not good to put on a &#x91;he didn&#x92;t do it&#x92; defense and a &#x91;he is sorry he did it&#x92; mitigation.  This just does not work.

Rev. 1557, 1589&#x96;1591 (1998) (interviews of jurors in capital trials indicate that juries approach the sentencing phase &#x93;cynically&#x94; where counsel&#x92;s sentencing-phase presentation is logically inconsistent with the guilt-phase defense);

				., at 1597 (in capital cases, a &#x93;run-of-the-mill strategy of challenging the prosecution&#x92;s case for failing to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt&#x94; can have dire implications for the sentencing phase).

Imploring the judge to spare the boys&#x92; lives, Darrow declared: &#x93;I do not know how much salvage there is in these two boys. &#x2026; I will be honest with this court as I have tried to be from the beginning.

				To summarize, in a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed.  When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendant&#x92;s best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsel&#x92;s strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendant&#x92;s explicit consent.  Instead, if counsel&#x92;s strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendant&#x92;s guilt, satisfies the Strickland
				 standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.

						 As Corin determined here, pleading guilty without a guarantee that the prosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little if any benefit for the defendant.

Pleading guilty not only relinquishes trial rights, it increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt during the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors&#x92; minds as they deliberate on the sentence.

				This capital case concerns defense counsel&#x92;s strategic decision to concede, at the guilt phase of the trial, the defendant&#x92;s commission of murder, and to concentrate the defense on establishing, at the penalty phase, cause for sparing the defendant&#x92;s life.  Any concession of that order, the Florida Supreme Court held, made without the defendant&#x92;s express consent&#x97;however gruesome the crime and despite the strength of the evidence of guilt&#x97;automatically ranks as prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitating a new trial.  We reverse the Florida Supreme Court&#x92;s judgment.

				Defense counsel undoubtedly has a duty to discuss potential strategies with the defendant.  See

.  But when a defendant, informed by counsel, neither consents nor objects to the course counsel describes as the most promising means to avert a sentence of death, counsel is not automatically barred from pursuing that course.  The reasonableness of counsel&#x92;s performance, after consultation with the defendant yields no response, must be judged in accord with the inquiry generally applicable to ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims: Did counsel&#x92;s representation &#x93;f[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness&#x94;?  
				<em>
					Id.,

				 at 688, 694.  The Florida Supreme Court erred in applying, instead, a presumption of deficient performance, as well as a presumption of prejudice; that latter presumption, we have instructed, is reserved for cases in which counsel fails meaningfully to oppose the prosecution&#x92;s case.

				The State gathered overwhelming evidence establishing that Nixon had committed the murder in the manner he described.

				In late August 1984, Nixon was indicted in Leon County, Florida, for first-degree murder, kidnaping, robbery, and arson.  See App. 1, 55.  Assistant public defender Michael Corin, assigned to represent Nixon, see 
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 232, filed a plea of not guilty, 
				<em>

				 at 468&#x96;469, and deposed all of the State&#x92;s potential witnesses, 
				<em>

				  Corin thereupon commenced plea negotiations, hoping to persuade the prosecution to drop the death penalty in exchange for Nixon&#x92;s guilty pleas to all charges.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, Corin turned his attention to the penalty phase, believing that the only way to save Nixon&#x92;s life would be to present extensive mitigation evidence centering on Nixon&#x92;s mental instability.  
				<em>
					Id.,

				 at 261, 473; see also 
				<em>

				, at 102.  Experienced in capital defense, see 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 248&#x96;250, Corin feared that denying Nixon&#x92;s commission of the kidnaping and murder during the guilt phase would compromise Corin&#x92;s ability to persuade the jury, during the penalty phase, that Nixon&#x92;s conduct was the product of his mental illness.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 473, 490, 505.  Corin concluded that the best strategy would be to concede guilt, thereby preserving his credibility in urging leniency during the penalty phase.

				Corin attempted to explain this strategy to Nixon at least three times.

				 at 466&#x96;467, Nixon was generally unresponsive during their discussions,

				<em>

				<em>

				When Nixon&#x92;s trial began on July 15, 1985, his unresponsiveness deepened into disruptive and violent behavior.  On the second day of jury selection, Nixon pulled off his clothing, demanded a black judge and lawyer, refused to be escorted into the courtroom, and threatened to force the guards to shoot him.  
				<em>
					Nixon I
				</em>
				, 572 So. 2d, at 1341; 10 Record 1934&#x96;1935.  An extended on-the-record colloquy followed Nixon&#x92;s bizarre behavior, during which Corin urged the trial judge to explain Nixon&#x92;s rights to him and ascertain whether Nixon understood the significance of absenting himself from the trial.  Corin also argued that restraining Nixon and compelling him to be present would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury.  
				<em>
					Id.,

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				&#x93;In this case, there won&#x92;t be any question, none whatsoever, that my client, Joe Elton Nixon, caused Jeannie Bickner&#x92;s death&#x2026; . [T]hat fact will be proved to your satisfaction beyond any doubt.

				During its case in chief, the State introduced the tape of Nixon&#x92;s confession, expert testimony on the manner in which Bickner died, and witness testimony regarding Nixon&#x92;s confessions to his relatives and his possession of Bickner&#x92;s car and personal effects.  Corin cross-examined these witnesses only when he felt their statements needed clarification, see, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 13 Record 2504, and he did not present a defense case, 20

				<em>
					id.,

				 at 2050&#x96;2058.  In his closing argument, Corin again conceded Nixon&#x92;s guilt, App. 73, and reminded the jury of the importance of the penalty phase: &#x93;I will hope to &#x2026; argue to you and give you reasons not that Mr. Nixon&#x92;s life be spared one final and terminal confinement forever, but that he not be sentenced to die,&#x94;

				, 395 U.

The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4, 7.  Further, the defense reserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence.  See

				Corin was obliged to, and in fact several times did, explain his proposed trial strategy to Nixon.  See

				, 857 So. 2d, at 187&#x96;188 (Wells, J., dissenting), Corin was not additionally required to gain express consent before conceding Nixon&#x92;s guilt.  The two evidentiary hearings conducted by the Florida trial court demonstrate beyond doubt that Corin fulfilled his duty of consultation by informing Nixon of counsel&#x92;s proposed strategy and its potential benefits.  Nixon&#x92;s characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him, in sum, did not suffice to render unreasonable Corin&#x92;s decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.

				The Florida Supreme Court&#x92;s erroneous equation of Corin&#x92;s concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply the wrong standard in determining whether counsel&#x92;s performance ranked as ineffective assistance.  The court first presumed deficient performance, then applied the presumption of prejudice that

				On the record thus far developed, Corin&#x92;s concession of Nixon&#x92;s guilt does not rank as a &#x93;fail[ure] to function in any meaningful sense as the Government&#x92;s adversary.&#x94;  
				<em>

				 Although such a concession in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceeding&#x92;s two-phase structure vitally affect counsel&#x92;s strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the defendant&#x92;s guilt is often clear.  Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 329 (1983).

				Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trial&#x92;s penalty phase, at which time counsel&#x92;s mission is to persuade the trier that his client&#x92;s life should be spared.  Unable to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence, defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  See Lyon, Defending the Death Penalty Case: What Makes Death Different?, 42 Mercer L. Rev. 695, 708 (1991) (&#x93;It is not good to put on a &#x91;he didn&#x92;t do it&#x92; defense and a &#x91;he is sorry he did it&#x92; mitigation.  This just does not work.

Rev. 1557, 1589&#x96;1591 (1998) (interviews of jurors in capital trials indicate that juries approach the sentencing phase &#x93;cynically&#x94; where counsel&#x92;s sentencing-phase presentation is logically inconsistent with the guilt-phase defense);

				., at 1597 (in capital cases, a &#x93;run-of-the-mill strategy of challenging the prosecution&#x92;s case for failing to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt&#x94; can have dire implications for the sentencing phase).

				<em>

				To summarize, in a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed.  When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendant&#x92;s best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsel&#x92;s strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendant&#x92;s explicit consent.  Instead, if counsel&#x92;s strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendant&#x92;s guilt, satisfies the Strickland
				 standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.

				This capital case concerns defense counsel&#x92;s strategic decision to concede, at the guilt phase of the trial, the defendant&#x92;s commission of murder, and to concentrate the defense on establishing, at the penalty phase, cause for sparing the defendant&#x92;s life.  Any concession of that order, the Florida Supreme Court held, made without the defendant&#x92;s express consent&#x97;however gruesome the crime and despite the strength of the evidence of guilt&#x97;automatically ranks as prejudicial ineffective assistance of counsel necessitating a new trial.

				Defense counsel undoubtedly has a duty to discuss potential strategies with the defendant.  See

				Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, Corin turned his attention to the penalty phase, believing that the only way to save Nixon&#x92;s life would be to present extensive mitigation evidence centering on Nixon&#x92;s mental instability.

				<em>

				When Nixon&#x92;s trial began on July 15, 1985, his unresponsiveness deepened into disruptive and violent behavior.  On the second day of jury selection, Nixon pulled off his clothing, demanded a black judge and lawyer, refused to be escorted into the courtroom, and threatened to force the guards to shoot him.

An extended on-the-record colloquy followed Nixon&#x92;s bizarre behavior, during which Corin urged the trial judge to explain Nixon&#x92;s rights to him and ascertain whether Nixon understood the significance of absenting himself from the trial.  Corin also argued that restraining Nixon and compelling him to be present would prejudice him in the eyes of the jury.

				During its case in chief, the State introduced the tape of Nixon&#x92;s confession, expert testimony on the manner in which Bickner died, and witness testimony regarding Nixon&#x92;s confessions to his relatives and his possession of Bickner&#x92;s car and personal effects.  Corin cross-examined these witnesses only when he felt their statements needed clarification, see,

The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 4, 7.  Further, the defense reserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence.  See

Nixon&#x92;s characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him, in sum, did not suffice to render unreasonable Corin&#x92;s decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.

				The Florida Supreme Court&#x92;s erroneous equation of Corin&#x92;s concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply the wrong standard in determining whether counsel&#x92;s performance ranked as ineffective assistance.

				On the record thus far developed, Corin&#x92;s concession of Nixon&#x92;s guilt does not rank as a &#x93;fail[ure] to function in any meaningful sense as the Government&#x92;s adversary.&#x94;

				 Although such a concession in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceeding&#x92;s two-phase structure vitally affect counsel&#x92;s strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the defendant&#x92;s guilt is often clear.  Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 329 (1983).

				Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trial&#x92;s penalty phase, at which time counsel&#x92;s mission is to persuade the trier that his client&#x92;s life should be spared.  Unable to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence, defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  See Lyon, Defending the Death Penalty Case: What Makes Death Different?, 42 Mercer L. Rev. 695, 708 (1991) (&#x93;It is not good to put on a &#x91;he didn&#x92;t do it&#x92; defense and a &#x91;he is sorry he did it&#x92; mitigation.  This just does not work.

				., at 1597 (in capital cases, a &#x93;run-of-the-mill strategy of challenging the prosecution&#x92;s case for failing to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt&#x94; can have dire implications for the sentencing phase).

				To summarize, in a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed.  When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendant&#x92;s best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsel&#x92;s strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendant&#x92;s explicit consent.  Instead, if counsel&#x92;s strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendant&#x92;s guilt, satisfies the Strickland
				 standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.

Pleading guilty not only relinquishes trial rights, it increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt during the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors&#x92; minds as they deliberate on the sentence.

				This capital case concerns defense counsel&#x92;s strategic decision to concede, at the guilt phase of the trial, the defendant&#x92;s commission of murder, and to concentrate the defense on establishing, at the penalty phase, cause for sparing the defendant&#x92;s life.

But when a defendant, informed by counsel, neither consents nor objects to the course counsel describes as the most promising means to avert a sentence of death, counsel is not automatically barred from pursuing that course.  The reasonableness of counsel&#x92;s performance, after consultation with the defendant yields no response, must be judged in accord with the inquiry generally applicable to ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims: Did counsel&#x92;s representation &#x93;f[a]ll below an objective standard of reasonableness&#x94;?

				Faced with the inevitability of going to trial on a capital charge, Corin turned his attention to the penalty phase, believing that the only way to save Nixon&#x92;s life would be to present extensive mitigation evidence centering on Nixon&#x92;s mental instability.

				When Nixon&#x92;s trial began on July 15, 1985, his unresponsiveness deepened into disruptive and violent behavior.

				Despite Corin&#x92;s concession, Nixon retained the rights accorded a defendant in a criminal trial.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Boykin
				</em>
				, 395 U. S., at 242&#x96;243, and n. 4 (a guilty plea is &#x93;more than a confession which admits that the accused did various acts,&#x94; it is a &#x93;stipulation that no proof by the prosecution need be advanced&#x94;).  The State was obliged to present during the guilt phase competent, admissible evidence establishing the essential elements of the crimes with which Nixon was charged.  That aggressive evidence would thus be separated from the penalty phase, enabling the defense to concentrate that portion of the trial on mitigating factors.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4, 7.  Further, the defense reserved the right to cross-examine witnesses for the prosecution and could endeavor, as Corin did, to exclude prejudicial evidence.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 6.  In addition, in the event of errors in the trial or jury instructions, a concession of guilt would not hinder the defendant&#x92;s right to appeal.

				Corin was obliged to, and in fact several times did, explain his proposed trial strategy to Nixon.  See

				, 857 So. 2d, at 187&#x96;188 (Wells, J., dissenting), Corin was not additionally required to gain express consent before conceding Nixon&#x92;s guilt.  The two evidentiary hearings conducted by the Florida trial court demonstrate beyond doubt that Corin fulfilled his duty of consultation by informing Nixon of counsel&#x92;s proposed strategy and its potential benefits.  Nixon&#x92;s characteristic silence each time information was conveyed to him, in sum, did not suffice to render unreasonable Corin&#x92;s decision to concede guilt and to home in, instead, on the life or death penalty issue.

				The Florida Supreme Court&#x92;s erroneous equation of Corin&#x92;s concession strategy to a guilty plea led it to apply the wrong standard in determining whether counsel&#x92;s performance ranked as ineffective assistance.  The court first presumed deficient performance, then applied the presumption of prejudice that

				On the record thus far developed, Corin&#x92;s concession of Nixon&#x92;s guilt does not rank as a &#x93;fail[ure] to function in any meaningful sense as the Government&#x92;s adversary.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.&lt;footcall num="5"&gt; 
				</em>
				 Although such a concession in a run-of-the-mine trial might present a closer question, the gravity of the potential sentence in a capital trial and the proceeding&#x92;s two-phase structure vitally affect counsel&#x92;s strategic calculus.  Attorneys representing capital defendants face daunting challenges in developing trial strategies, not least because the defendant&#x92;s guilt is often clear.  Prosecutors are more likely to seek the death penalty, and to refuse to accept a plea to a life sentence, when the evidence is overwhelming and the crime heinous.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 329 (1983).

				Counsel therefore may reasonably decide to focus on the trial&#x92;s penalty phase, at which time counsel&#x92;s mission is to persuade the trier that his client&#x92;s life should be spared.  Unable to negotiate a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence, defense counsel must strive at the guilt phase to avoid a counterproductive course.  See Lyon, Defending the Death Penalty Case: What Makes Death Different?, 42 Mercer L. Rev. 695, 708 (1991) (&#x93;It is not good to put on a &#x91;he didn&#x92;t do it&#x92; defense and a &#x91;he is sorry he did it&#x92; mitigation.  This just does not work.

Rev. 1557, 1589&#x96;1591 (1998) (interviews of jurors in capital trials indicate that juries approach the sentencing phase &#x93;cynically&#x94; where counsel&#x92;s sentencing-phase presentation is logically inconsistent with the guilt-phase defense); 
				<em>
					id
				</em>
				., at 1597 (in capital cases, a &#x93;run-of-the-mill strategy of challenging the prosecution&#x92;s case for failing to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt&#x94; can have dire implications for the sentencing phase).  In this light, counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for attempting to impress the jury with his candor and his unwillingness to engage in &#x93;a useless charade.&#x94;  See 
				<em>
					Cronic
				</em>
				, 466 U. S., at 656&#x96;657, n. 19.  Renowned advocate Clarence Darrow, we note, famously employed a similar strategy as counsel for the youthful, cold-blooded killers Richard
				 
				Loeb and Nathan Leopold.  Imploring the judge to spare the boys&#x92; lives, Darrow declared: &#x93;I do not know how much salvage there is in these two boys. &#x2026; I will be honest with this court as I have tried to be from the beginning.  I know that these boys are not fit to be at large.&#x94;  Attorney for the Damned: Clarence Darrow in the Courtroom 84 (A. Weinberg ed. 1989); see Tr. of Oral Arg. 40&#x96;41 (Darrow&#x92;s clients &#x93;did not expressly consent to what he did.  But he saved their lives.&#x94;); cf.

				To summarize, in a capital case, counsel must consider in conjunction both the guilt and penalty phases in determining how best to proceed.  When counsel informs the defendant of the strategy counsel believes to be in the defendant&#x92;s best interest and the defendant is unresponsive, counsel&#x92;s strategic choice is not impeded by any blanket rule demanding the defendant&#x92;s explicit consent.  Instead, if counsel&#x92;s strategy, given the evidence bearing on the defendant&#x92;s guilt, satisfies the Strickland
				 standard, that is the end of the matter; no tenable claim of ineffective assistance would remain.

						 Every court to consider this case, including the judge who presided over Nixon&#x92;s trial, agreed with Corin&#x92;s assessment of the evidence.  See, e.g., Nixon v. Singletary, 758 So. 2d 618, 625 (Fla. 2000) (per curiam) (evidence of guilt was &#x93;overwhelming&#x94;); State v. Nixon, Case No. 84&#x96;2324 (Fla. Cir.

						 Nixon contended in the alternative that Corin&#x92;s decision to concede guilt was unreasonable and prejudicial under the generally applicable standard set out in Strickland v. Washington, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/668" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984)
.  App. 385, 389; see supra, at 1&#x96;2.  Nixon also raised several other challenges to his conviction and sentence.  See App. 378&#x96;384; 390&#x96;392.

						 In his brief before this Court, Nixon describes inconsistencies in the State&#x92;s evidence at the guilt phase of the trial.  See Brief for Respondent 13&#x96;22.  Corin&#x92;s failure to explore these inconsistencies, measured against the Strickland standard, 466 U. S., at 690, Nixon maintains, constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. The Florida Supreme Court did not address the alleged inconsistencies and we decline to consider the matter in the first instance.

						 As Corin determined here, pleading guilty without a guarantee that the prosecution will recommend a life sentence holds little if any benefit for the defendant.  See ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases &#xA7;10.9.2, Commentary (rev. ed. 2003), reprinted in 31 Hofstra L. Rev. 913, 1045 (2003) (&#x93;If no written guarantee can be obtained that death will not be imposed following a plea of guilty, counsel should be extremely reluctant to participate in a waiver of the client&#x92;s trial rights.&#x94;).  Pleading guilty not only relinquishes trial rights, it increases the likelihood that the State will introduce aggressive evidence of guilt during the sentencing phase, so that the gruesome details of the crime are fresh in the jurors&#x92; minds as they deliberate on the sentence.  See Goodpaster, The Trial for Life: Effective Assistance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, 58 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 299, 331 (1983); supra, at 7, 11.
