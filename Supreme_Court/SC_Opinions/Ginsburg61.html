				This case concerns the authority the Constitution assigns to Congress to prescribe the duration of copyrights.  The Copyright and Patent Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, &#xA7;8, cl. 8, provides as to copyrights: &#x93;Congress shall have Power &#x2026; [t]o promote the Progress of Science &#x2026; by securing [to Authors] for limited Times &#x2026; the exclusive Right to their &#x2026; Writings.&#x94;  In 1998, in the measure here under inspection, Congress enlarged the duration of copyrights by 20 years.

				Petitioners are individuals and businesses whose products or services build on copyrighted works that have gone into the public domain.  They seek a determination that the CTEA fails constitutional review under both the Copyright Clause&#x92;s &#x93;limited Times&#x94; prescription and the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>&#x92;s free speech guarantee.  Under the 1976 Copyright Act, copyright protection generally lasted from the work&#x92;s creation until 50 years after the author&#x92;s death.  Pub. L. 94&#x96;553, &#xA7;302(a),

Petitioners do not challenge the &#x93;life-plus-70-years&#x94; time span itself.  &#x93;Whether 50 years is enough, or 70 years too much,&#x94; they acknowledge, &#x93;is not a judgment meet for this Court.&#x94;  Brief for Petitioners 14.

				  Congress went awry, petitioners maintain, not with respect to newly created works, but in enlarging the term for published works with existing copyrights.  The &#x93;limited Tim[e]&#x94; in effect when a copyright is secured, petitioners urge, becomes the con-

				stitutional boundary, a clear line beyond the power of Congress to extend.  See 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				  As to the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>, petitioners contend that the CTEA is a content-neutral regulation of speech that fails inspection under the heightened judicial scrutiny appropriate for such regulations.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In accord with the District Court and the Court of Appeals, we reject petitioners&#x92; challenges to the CTEA.  In that 1998 legislation, as in all previous copyright term extensions, Congress placed existing and future copyrights in parity.  In prescribing that alignment, we hold, Congress acted within its authority and did not transgress constitutional limitations.

				We evaluate petitioners&#x92; challenge to the constitutionality of the CTEA against the backdrop of Congress&#x92; previous exercises of its authority under the Copyright Clause.  The Nation&#x92;s first copyright statute, enacted in 1790, provided a federal copyright term of 14 years from the date of publication, renewable for an additional 14 years if the author survived the first term.

				In 1976, Congress altered the method for computing federal copyright terms.  1976 Act &#xA7;&#xA7;302&#x96;304.  For works created by identified natural persons, the 1976 Act provided that federal copyright protection would run from the work&#x92;s creation, not&#x97;as in the 1790, 1831, and 1909 Acts&#x97;its publication; protection would last until 50 years after the author&#x92;s death.  &#xA7;302(a).  In these respects, the 1976 Act aligned United States copyright terms with the then-dominant international standard adopted under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.  See H. R. Rep. No. 94&#x96;1476, p. 135 (1976).  For anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire, the 1976 Act provided a term of 75 years from publication or 100 years from creation, whichever expired first.  &#xA7;302(c).

For published works with existing copyrights as of that date, the 1976 Act granted a copyright term of 75 years from the date of publication, &#xA7;304(a) and (b), a 19-year increase over the 56-year term applicable under the 1909 Act.

				  Petitioners contend, however, that existing copyrights extended to endure for that same term are not &#x93;limited.&#x94;  Petitioners&#x92; argument essentially reads into the text of the Copyright Clause the command that a time prescription, once set, becomes forever &#x93;fixed&#x94; or &#x93;inalterable.&#x94;  The word &#x93;limited,&#x94; however, does not convey a meaning so constricted.  At the time of the Framing, that word meant what it means today: &#x93;confine[d] within certain bounds,&#x94; &#x93;restrain[ed],&#x94; or &#x93;circumscribe[d].&#x94;  S.

				Congress&#x92; consistent historical practice of applying newly enacted copyright terms to future and existing copyrights reflects a judgment stated concisely by Representative Huntington at the time of the 1831 Act: &#x93;[J]ustice, policy, and equity alike forb[id]&#x94; that an &#x93;author who had sold his [work] a week ago, be placed in a worse situation than the author who should sell his work the day after the passing of [the] act.&#x94;  7 Cong.

The CTEA follows this historical practice by keeping the duration provisions of the 1976 Act largely in place and simply adding 20 years to each of them.  Guided by text, history, and precedent, we cannot agree with petitioners&#x92; submission that extending the duration of existing copyrights is categorically beyond Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright Clause.

				The CTEA reflects judgments of a kind Congress typically makes, judgments we cannot dismiss as outside the Legislature&#x92;s domain.  As respondent describes, see Brief for Respondent 37&#x96;38, a key factor in the CTEA&#x92;s passage was a 1993 European Union (EU) directive instructing EU members to establish a copyright term of life plus 70 years.  EU Council Directive 93/98, p. 4; see 144 Cong. Rec. S12377&#x96;S12378 (daily ed. Oct. 12, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch).  Consistent with the Berne Convention, the EU directed its members to deny this longer term to the works of any non-EU country whose laws did not secure the same extended term.  See Berne Conv. Art. 7(8); P. Goldstein, International Copyright &#xA7;5.3, p. 239 (2001).  By extending the baseline United States copyright term to life plus 70 years, Congress sought to ensure that American authors would receive the same copyright protection in Europe as their European counterparts.

				In sum, we find that the CTEA is a rational enactment; we are not at liberty to second-guess congressional determinations and policy judgments of this order, however debatable or arguably unwise they may be.  Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the CTEA&#x97;which continues the unbroken congressional practice of treating future and existing copyrights in parity for term extension purposes&#x97;is an impermissible exercise of Congress&#x92; power under the Copyright Clause.

				Petitioners dominantly advance a series of arguments all premised on the proposition that Congress may not extend an existing copyright absent new consideration from the author.  They pursue this main theme under three headings.  Petitioners contend that the CTEA&#x92;s extension of existing copyrights (1) overlooks the requirement of &#x93;originality,&#x94; (2) fails to &#x93;promote the Progress of Science,&#x94; and (3) ignores copyright&#x92;s

				 at 359.  Relying on 
				<em>

				More forcibly, petitioners contend that the CTEA&#x92;s extension of existing copyrights does not &#x93;promote the Progress of Science&#x94; as contemplated by the preambular language of the Copyright Clause.  Art. I, &#xA7;8, cl. 8.  To sustain this objection, petitioners do not argue that the Clause&#x92;s preamble is an independently enforceable limit on Congress&#x92; power.  See 239 F. 3d, at 378 (Petitioners acknowledge that &#x93;the preamble of the Copyright Clause is not a substantive limit on Congress&#x92; legislative power.&#x94; (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Rather, they maintain that the preambular language identifies the sole end to which Congress may legislate; accordingly, they conclude, the meaning of &#x93;limited Times&#x94; must be &#x93;determined in light of that specified end.&#x94;  Brief for Petitioners 19.  The CTEA&#x92;s extension of existing copyrights categorically fails to &#x93;promote the Progress of Science,&#x94; petitioners argue, because it does not stimulate the creation of new works but merely adds value to works already created.

				Closely related to petitioners&#x92; preambular argument, or a variant of it, is their assertion that the Copyright Clause &#x93;imbeds a quid pro quo.&#x94;  Brief for Petitioners 23.  They contend, in this regard, that Congress may grant to an &#x93;Autho[r]&#x94; an &#x93;exclusive Right&#x94; for a &#x93;limited Tim[e],&#x94; but only in exchange for a &#x93;Writin[g].&#x94;  Congress&#x92; power to confer copyright protection, petitioners argue, is thus contingent upon an exchange: The author of an original work receives an &#x93;exclusive Right&#x94; for a &#x93;limited Tim[e]&#x94; in exchange for a dedication to the public thereafter.  Extending an existing copyright without demanding additional consideration, petitioners maintain, bestows an unpaid-for benefit on copyright holders and their heirs, in violation of the 
				<em>
					quid pro quo
				</em>
				 requirement.

				We can demur to petitioners&#x92; description of the Copyright Clause as a grant of legislative authority empowering Congress &#x93;to secure a bargain&#x97;this for that.&#x94;  Brief for Petitioners 16; see

 (&#x93;The economic philosophy behind the clause empowering Congress to grant patents and copyrights is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors in &#x91;Science and useful Arts.&#x92; &#x94;).  But the legislative evolution earlier recalled demonstrates what the bargain entails.  Given the consistent placement of existing copyright holders in parity with future holders, the author of a work created in the last 170 years would reasonably comprehend, as the &#x93;this&#x94; offered her, a copyright not only for the time in place when protection is gained, but also for any renewal or extension legislated during that time.

				  Congress could rationally seek to &#x93;promote &#x2026; Progress&#x94; by including in every copyright statute an express guarantee that authors would receive the benefit of any later legislative extension of the copyright term.  Nothing in the Copyright Clause bars Congress from creating the same incentive by adopting the same position as a matter of unbroken practice.  See Brief for Respondent 31&#x96;32.

				  We reject petitioners&#x92; plea for imposition of uncommonly strict scrutiny on a copyright scheme that incorporates its own speech-protective purposes and safeguards.  The Copyright Clause and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> were adopted close in time.  This proximity indicates that, in the Framers&#x92; view, copyright&#x92;s limited monopolies are compatible with free speech principles.  Indeed, copyright&#x92;s purpose is to 
				<em>
					promote
				</em>
				 the creation and publication of free expression.  As 
				<em>
					Harper &amp; Row
				</em>
				 observed: &#x93;[T]he Framers intended copyright itself to be the engine of free expression.  By establishing a marketable right to the use of one&#x92;s expression, copyright supplies the economic incentive to create and disseminate ideas.&#x94;  471 U. S., at 558.

				In addition to spurring the creation and publication of new expression, copyright law contains built-in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> accommodations.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 560.  First, it distinguishes between ideas and expression and makes only the latter eligible for copyright protection.  Specifically, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/102.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">17 U. S. C. &#xA7;102(b)</a> provides: &#x93;In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.&#x94;  As we said in 
				<em>
					Harper &amp; Row
				</em>
				, this &#x93;idea/expression dichotomy strike[s] a definitional balance between the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> and the Copyright Act by permitting free communication of facts while still protecting an author&#x92;s expression.&#x94;  471 U.

Due to this distinction, every idea, theory, and fact in a copyrighted work becomes instantly available for public exploitation at the moment of publication.  See

				<em>

				 required cable operators to carry and transmit broadcast stations through their proprietary cable systems.  Those &#x93;must-carry&#x94; provisions, we explained, implicated &#x93;the heart of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>,&#x94; namely, &#x93;the principle that each person should decide for himself or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and adherence.&#x94;

				The CTEA, in contrast, does not oblige anyone to reproduce another&#x92;s speech against the carrier&#x92;s will.  Instead, it protects authors&#x92; original expression from unrestricted exploitation.  Protection of that order does not raise the free speech concerns present when the government compels or burdens the communication of particular facts or ideas.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> securely protects the freedom to make&#x97;or decline to make&#x97;one&#x92;s own speech; it bears less heavily when speakers assert the right to make other people&#x92;s speeches.  To the extent such assertions raise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> concerns, copyright&#x92;s built-in free speech safeguards are generally adequate to address them.  We recognize that the D. C. Circuit spoke too broadly when it declared copyrights &#x93;categorically immune from challenges under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.&#x94;  239 F. 3d, at 375.  But when, as in this case, Congress has not altered the traditional contours of copyright protection, further 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> scrutiny is unnecessary.  See

				If petitioners&#x92; vision of the Copyright Clause held sway, it would do more than render the CTEA&#x92;s duration extensions unconstitutional as to existing works.  Indeed, petitioners&#x92; assertion that the provisions of the CTEA are not severable would make the CTEA&#x92;s enlarged terms invalid even as to tomorrow&#x92;s work.  The 1976 Act&#x92;s time extensions, which set the pattern that the CTEA followed, would be vulnerable as well.

The wisdom of Congress&#x92; action, however, is not within our province to second guess.  Satisfied that the legislation before us remains inside the domain the Constitution assigns to the First Branch, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

						 Petitioners argue that the 1790 Act must be distinguished from the later Acts on the ground that it covered existing works but did not extend existing copyrights.  Reply Brief 3&#x96;7.  The parties disagree on the question whether the 1790 Act&#x92;s copyright term should be regarded in part as compensation for the loss of any then existing state- or common-law copyright protections.  See Brief for Petitioners 28&#x96;30; Brief for Respondent 17, n. 9; Reply Brief 3&#x96;7.  Without resolving that dispute, we underscore that the First Congress clearly did confer copyright protection on works that had already been created.

						 We note again that Justice Breyer makes no such concession.  See supra, at 2, n. 1.  He does not train his fire, as petitioners do, on Congress&#x92; choice to place existing and future copyrights in parity.  Moving beyond the bounds of the parties&#x92; presentations, and with abundant policy arguments but precious little support from precedent, he would condemn Congress&#x92; entire product as irrational.

						 This approach comported with English practice at the time.  The Statute of Anne, 1710, 8 Ann. c. 19, provided copyright protection to books not yet composed or published, books already composed but not yet published, and books already composed and published.  See ibid. (&#x93;[T]he author of any book or books already composed, and not printed and published, or that shall hereafter be composed, and his assignee or assigns, shall have the sole liberty of printing and reprinting such book and books for the term of fourteen years, to commence from the day of the first publishing the same, and no longer.&#x94;); ibid.  (&#x93;[T]he author of any book or books already printed &#x2026; or the bookseller or booksellers, printer or printers, or other person or persons, who hath or have purchased or acquired the copy or copies of any book or books, in order to print or reprint the same, shall have the sole right and liberty of printing such book and books for the term of one and twenty years, to commence from the said tenth day of April, and no longer.&#x94;).


Justice Stevens stresses the rejection of a proposed amendment to the Statute of Anne that would have extended the term of existing copyrights, and reports that opponents of the extension feared it would perpetuate the monopoly position enjoyed by English booksellers.  Post, at 12, and n. 9.  But the English Parliament confronted a situation that never existed in the United States.  Through the late 17th century, a government-sanctioned printing monopoly was held by the Stationers&#x92; Company, &#x93;the ancient London guild of printers and booksellers.&#x94;  M. Rose, Authors and Owners: The Invention of Copyright 4 (1993); see L. Patterson, Copyright in Historical Perspective ch. 3 (1968).  Although that legal monopoly ended in 1695, concerns about monopolistic practices remained, and the 18th century English Parliament was resistant to any enhancement of booksellers&#x92; and publishers&#x92; entrenched position.  See Rose, supra, at 52&#x96;56.  In this country, in contrast, competition among publishers, printers, and booksellers was &#x93;intens[e]&#x94; at the time of the founding, and &#x93;there was not even a rough analog to the Stationers&#x92; Company on the horizon.&#x94;  Nachbar, Constructing Copyright&#x92;s Mythology, 6 Green Bag 2d 37, 45 (2002).  The Framers guarded against the future accumulation of monopoly power in booksellers and publishers by authorizing Congress to vest copyrights only in &#x93;Authors.&#x94;  Justice Stevens does not even attempt to explain how Parliament&#x92;s response to England&#x92;s experience with a publishing monopoly may be construed to impose a constitutional limitation on Congress&#x92; power to extend copyrights granted to &#x93;Authors.&#x94;

						 Moreover, the precise duration of a federal copyright has never been fixed at the time of the initial grant.  The 1790 Act provided a federal copyright term of 14 years from the work&#x92;s publication, renewable for an additional 14 years if the author survived and applied for an additional term.  &#xA7;1.  Congress retained that approach in subsequent statutes.  See Stewart v. Abend, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/495/207" class="subref" title="subref">495 U. S. 207</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">217</a> (1990)
 (&#x93;Since the earliest copyright statute in this country, the copyright term of ownership has been split between an original term and a renewal term.&#x94;).  Similarly, under the method for measuring copyright terms established by the 1976 Act and retained by the CTEA, the baseline copyright term is measured in part by the life of the author, rendering its duration indeterminate at the time of the grant.  See 1976 Act &#xA7;302(a);

						 Justice Stevens would sweep away these decisions, asserting that Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/1" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 1</a> (1966)
, &#x93;flatly contradicts&#x94; them.  Post, at 17.  Nothing but wishful thinking underpins that assertion.  The controversy in Graham involved no patent extension.  Graham addressed an invention&#x92;s very eligibility for patent protection, and spent no words on Congress&#x92; power to enlarge a patent&#x92;s duration.

						 Justice Stevens recites words from Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/376/225" class="subref" title="subref">376 U. S. 225</a> (1964)
, supporting the uncontroversial proposition that a State may not &#x93;extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date,&#x94; id., at 231, then boldly asserts that for the same reasons Congress may not do so either.  See post, at 1, 5.  But Sears placed no reins on Congress&#x92; authority to extend a patent&#x92;s life.  The full sentence in Sears, from which Justice Stevens extracts words, reads: &#x93;Obviously a State could not, consistently with the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date or give a patent on an article which lacked the level of invention required for federal patents.&#x94;  376 U. S., at 231.  The point insistently made in Sears is no more and no less than this: States may not enact measures inconsistent with the federal patent laws.  Ibid. (&#x93;[A] State cannot encroach upon the federal patent laws directly &#x2026; [and] cannot &#x2026; give protection of a kind that clashes with the objectives of the federal patent laws.&#x94;).  A decision thus rooted in the Supremacy Clause cannot be turned around to shrink congressional choices.


Also unavailing is Justice Stevens&#x92; appeal to language found in a private letter written by James Madison.  Post, at 9, n. 6; see also dissenting opinion of Breyer, J., post, at 5, 20.  Respondent points to a better &#x93;demonstrat[ion],&#x94; post, at 5, n. 3 (Stevens, J., dissenting), of Madison&#x92;s and other Framers&#x92; understanding of the scope of Congress&#x92; power to extend patents: &#x93;[T]hen-President Thomas Jefferson&#x97;the first administrator of the patent system, and perhaps the Founder with the narrowest view of the copyright and patent powers&#x97;signed the 1808 and 1809 patent term extensions into law; &#x2026; James Madison, who drafted the Constitution&#x92;s &#x91;limited Times&#x92; language, issued the extended patents under those laws as Secretary of State; and &#x2026; Madison as President signed another patent term extension in 1815.&#x94;  Brief for Respondent 15.

						 Justice Stevens reads McClurg to convey that &#x93;Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee.&#x94; Post, at 19.  But McClurg concerned no such change.  To the contrary, as Justice Stevens acknowledges, McClurg held that use of an invention by the patentee&#x92;s employer did not invalidate the inventor&#x92;s 1834 patent, &#x93;even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.&#x94;  Post, at 18.  In other words, McClurg evaluated the patentee&#x92;s rights not simply in light of the patent law in force at the time the patent issued, but also in light of &#x93;such changes as ha[d] been since made.&#x94;  1 How., at 206.  It is thus inescapably plain that McClurg upheld the application of expanded patent protection to an existing patent.

						 Justice Breyer would adopt a heightened, three-part test for the constitutionality of copyright enactments.  Post, at 3.  He would invalidate the CTEA as irrational in part because, in his view, harmonizing the United States and European Union baseline copyright terms &#x93;apparent[ly]&#x94; fails to achieve &#x93;significant&#x94; uniformity.  Post, at 23.  But see infra, at 15.  The novelty of the &#x93;rational basis&#x94; approach he presents is plain.  Cf. Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,

).  Rather than subjecting Congress&#x92; legislative choices in the copyright area to heightened judicial scrutiny, we have stressed that &#x93;it is not our role to alter the delicate balance Congress has labored to achieve.&#x94;  Stewart v.

						 Responding to an inquiry whether copyrights could be extended &#x93;forever,&#x94; Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters emphasized the dominant reason for the CTEA: &#x93;There certainly are proponents of perpetual copyright: We heard that in our proceeding on term extension.  The Songwriters Guild suggested a perpetual term.  However, our Constitution says limited times, but there really isn&#x92;t a very good indication on what limited times is.

						 Members of Congress expressed the view that, as a result of increases in human longevity and in parents&#x92; average age when their children are born, the pre-CTEA term did not adequately secure &#x93;the right to profit from licensing one&#x92;s work during one&#x92;s lifetime andto take pride and comfort in knowing that one&#x92;s children&#x97;and per-haps their children&#x97;might also benefit from one&#x92;s posthumous popularity.&#x94;  141 Cong.

						 Justice Breyer urges that the economic incentives accompanying copyright term extension are too insignificant to &#x93;mov[e]&#x94; any author with a &#x93;rational economic perspective.&#x94;  Post, at 14; see post, at 13&#x96;16.  Calibrating rational economic incentives, however, like &#x93;fashion[ing] &#x2026; new rules [in light of] new technology,&#x94; Sony, 464 U. S., at 431, is a task primarily for Congress, not the courts.  Congress heard testimony from a number of prominent artists; each expressed the belief that the copyright system&#x92;s assurance of fair compensation for themselves and their heirs was an incentive to create.  See, e.g., House Hearings 233&#x96;239 (statement of Quincy Jones); Copyright Term Extension Act of 1995: Hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 55&#x96;56 (1995) (statement of Bob Dylan); id., at 56&#x96;57 (statement of Don Henley); id., at 57 (statement of Carlos Santana).  We would not take Congress to task for crediting this evidence which, as Justice Breyer acknowledges, reflects general &#x93;propositions about the value of incentives&#x94; that are &#x93;undeniably true.&#x94;  Post, at 14. 


Congress also heard testimony from Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters and others regarding the economic incentives created by the CTEA.  According to the Register, extending the copyright for existing works &#x93;could &#x2026; provide additional income that would finance the production and distribution of new works.&#x94;  House Hearings 158.  &#x93;Authors would not be able to continue to create,&#x94; the Register explained, &#x93;unless they earned income on their finished works.  The public benefits not only from an author&#x92;s original work but also from his or her further creations.  Although this truism may be illustrated in many ways, one of the best examples is Noah Webster[,] who supported his entire family from the earnings on his speller and grammar during the twenty years he took to complete his dictionary.&#x94;  Id., at 165.

						 Justice Breyer agrees that &#x93;Congress did not intend to act unconstitutionally&#x94; when it enacted the CTEA, post, at 15, yet in his very next breath, he seems to make just that accusation, ibid.  What else is one to glean from his selection of scattered statements from individual members of Congress?  He does not identify any statement in the statutory text that installs a perpetual copyright, for there is none.  But even if the statutory text were sufficiently ambiguous to warrant recourse to legislative history, Justice Breyer&#x92;s selections are not the sort to which this Court accords high value: &#x93;In surveying legislative history we have repeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding the Legislature&#x92;s intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill, which &#x91;represen[t] the considered and collective understanding of those [members of Congress] involved in drafting and studying proposed legislation.&#x92; &#x94;  Garcia v.

 (quoting Zuber v. Allen,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">186</a> (1969)
).  The House and Senate Reports accompanying the CTEA reflect no purpose to make copyright a forever thing.  Notably, the Senate Report expressly acknowledged that the Constitution &#x93;clearly precludes Congress from granting unlimited protection for copyrighted works,&#x94; S. Rep. No. 104&#x96;315, p. 11 (1996), and disclaimed any intent to contravene that prohibition, ibid.  Members of Congress instrumental in the CTEA&#x92;s passage spoke to similar effect.  See, e.g., 144 Cong. Rec. H1458 (daily ed. Mar. 25, 1998) (statement of Rep. Coble) (observing that &#x93;copyright protection should be for a limited time only&#x94; and that &#x93;[p]erpetual protection does not benefit society&#x94;).   


Justice Breyer nevertheless insists that the &#x93;economic effect&#x94; of the CTEA is to make the copyright term &#x93;virtually perpetual.&#x94;  Post, at 1.  Relying on formulas and assumptions provided in an amicus brief supporting petitioners, he stresses that the CTEA creates a copyright term worth 99.8% of the value of a perpetual copyright.  Post, at 13&#x96;15.  If Justice Breyer&#x92;s calculations were a basis for holding the CTEA unconstitutional, then the 1976 Act would surely fall as well, for&#x97;under the same assumptions he indulges&#x97;the term set by that Act secures 99.4% of the value of a perpetual term.  See Brief for George A. Akerloff et al. as Amici Curiae 6, n. 6 (describing the relevant formula).  Indeed, on that analysis even the &#x93;limited&#x94; character of the 1909 (97.7%) and 1831 (94.1%) Acts might be suspect.  Justice Breyer several times places the Founding Fathers on his side.  See, e.g., post, at 5, 20.  It is doubtful, however, that those architects of our Nation, in framing the &#x93;limited Times&#x94; prescription, thought in terms of the calculator rather than the calendar.

						 Respondent notes that the CTEA&#x92;s life-plus-70-years baseline term is expected to produce an average copyright duration of 95 years, and that this term &#x93;resembles some other long-accepted durational practices in the law, such as 99-year leases of real property and bequests within the rule against perpetuities.&#x94;  Brief for Respondent 27, n. 18.  Whether such referents mark the outer boundary of &#x93;limited Times&#x94; is not before us today.  Justice Breyer suggests that the CTEA&#x92;s baseline term extends beyond that typically permitted by the traditional rule against perpetuities.  Post, at 15&#x96;16.  The traditional common-law rule looks to lives in being plus 21 years.  Under that rule, the period before a bequest vests could easily equal or exceed the anticipated average copyright term under the CTEA.  If, for example, the vesting period on a deed were defined with reference to the life of an infant, the sum of the measuring life plus 21 years could commonly add up to 95 years.

						 Justice Stevens&#x92; characterization of reward to the author as &#x93;a secondary consideration&#x94; of copyright law, post, at 6, n. 4 (internal quotation marks omitted), understates the relationship between such rewards and the &#x93;Progress of Science.&#x94;  As we have explained, &#x93;[t]he economic philosophy behind the [Copyright] [C]lause &#x2026; is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors.&#x94;  Mazer v. Stein,

.  Accordingly, &#x93;copyright law celebrates the profit motive, recognizing that the incentive to profit from the exploitation of copyrights will redound to the public benefit by resulting in the proliferation of knowledge&#x2026; .  The profit motive is the engine that ensures the progress of science.&#x94;  American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 802 F. Supp. 1, 27 (SDNY 1992), aff&#x92;d, 60 F. 3d 913 (CA2 1994).  Rewarding authors for their creative labor and &#x93;promot[ing] &#x2026; Progress&#x94; are thus complementary; as James Madison observed, in copyright &#x93;[t]he public good fully coincides &#x2026; with the claims of individuals.&#x94;  The Federalist No. 43, p. 272 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).  Justice Breyer&#x92;s assertion that &#x93;copyright statutes must serve public, not private, ends&#x94; post, at 6, similarly misses the mark.  The two ends are not mutually exclusive; copyright law serves public ends by providing individuals with an incentive to pursue private ones.

						 As we have noted, see supra, at 5, n. 3, petitioners seek to distinguish the 1790 Act from those that followed.  They argue that by requiring authors seeking its protection to surrender whatever rights they had under state law, the 1790 Act enhanced uniformity and certainty and thus &#x93;promote[d] &#x2026; Progress.&#x94;  See Brief for Petitioners 28&#x96;31.  This account of the 1790 Act simply confirms, however, thatthe First Congress understood it could &#x93;promote &#x2026; Progress&#x94; by extending copyright protection to existing works.  Every subsequent adjustment of copyright&#x92;s duration, including the CTEA, reflects a similar understanding.

						 The fact that patent and copyright involve different exchanges does not, of course, mean that we may not be guided in our &#x93;limited Times&#x94; analysis by Congress&#x92; repeated extensions of existing patents.  See supra, at 10&#x96;13.  If patent&#x92;s quid pro quo is more exacting than copyright&#x92;s, then Congress&#x92; repeated extensions of existing patents without constitutional objection suggests even more strongly that similar legislation with respect to copyrights is constitutionally permissible.

						 Petitioners originally framed this argument as implicating the CTEA&#x92;s extension of both existing and future copyrights.  See Pet. for Cert. i.  Now, however, they train on the CTEA&#x92;s extension of existing copyrights and urge against consideration of the CTEA&#x92;s 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> validity as applied to future copyrights.  See Brief for Petitioners 39&#x96;48; Reply Brief 16&#x96;17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11&#x96;13.  We therefore consider petitioners&#x92; argument as so limited.  We note, however, that petitioners do not explain how their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> argument is moored to the prospective/retrospective line they urge us to draw, nor do they say whether or how their free speech argument applies to copyright duration but not to other aspects of copyright protection, notably scope.

In both postures, it is appropriate to construe copyright&#x92;s internal safeguards to accommodate

				This case concerns the authority the Constitution assigns to Congress to prescribe the duration of copyrights.  The Copyright and Patent Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, &#xA7;8, cl. 8, provides as to copyrights: &#x93;Congress shall have Power &#x2026; [t]o promote the Progress of Science &#x2026; by securing [to Authors] for limited Times &#x2026; the exclusive Right to their &#x2026; Writings.&#x94;  In 1998, in the measure here under inspection, Congress enlarged the duration of copyrights by 20 years.

				In accord with the District Court and the Court of Appeals, we reject petitioners&#x92; challenges to the CTEA.  In that 1998 legislation, as in all previous copyright term extensions, Congress placed existing and future copyrights in parity.  In prescribing that alignment, we hold, Congress acted within its authority and did not transgress constitutional limitations.

				We evaluate petitioners&#x92; challenge to the constitutionality of the CTEA against the backdrop of Congress&#x92; previous exercises of its authority under the Copyright Clause.  The Nation&#x92;s first copyright statute, enacted in 1790, provided a federal copyright term of 14 years from the date of publication, renewable for an additional 14 years if the author survived the first term.  Act of May 31, 1790, ch. 15, &#xA7;1,

For works created by identified natural persons, the 1976 Act provided that federal copyright protection would run from the work&#x92;s creation, not&#x97;as in the 1790, 1831, and 1909 Acts&#x97;its publication; protection would last until 50 years after the author&#x92;s death.  &#xA7;302(a).  In these respects, the 1976 Act aligned United States copyright terms with the then-dominant international standard adopted under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.  See H. R. Rep. No. 94&#x96;1476, p. 135 (1976).  For anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire, the 1976 Act provided a term of 75 years from publication or 100 years from creation, whichever expired first.  &#xA7;302(c).

				  Petitioners contend, however, that existing copyrights extended to endure for that same term are not &#x93;limited.&#x94;  Petitioners&#x92; argument essentially reads into the text of the Copyright Clause the command that a time prescription, once set, becomes forever &#x93;fixed&#x94; or &#x93;inalterable.&#x94;  The word &#x93;limited,&#x94; however, does not convey a meaning so constricted.  At the time of the Framing, that word meant what it means today: &#x93;confine[d] within certain bounds,&#x94; &#x93;restrain[ed],&#x94; or &#x93;circumscribe[d].&#x94;  S.

				Congress&#x92; consistent historical practice of applying newly enacted copyright terms to future and existing copyrights reflects a judgment stated concisely by Representative Huntington at the time of the 1831 Act: &#x93;[J]ustice, policy, and equity alike forb[id]&#x94; that an &#x93;author who had sold his [work] a week ago, be placed in a worse situation than the author who should sell his work the day after the passing of [the] act.&#x94;  7 Cong.

The CTEA follows this historical practice by keeping the duration provisions of the 1976 Act largely in place and simply adding 20 years to each of them.  Guided by text, history, and precedent, we cannot agree with petitioners&#x92; submission that extending the duration of existing copyrights is categorically beyond Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright Clause.

				The CTEA reflects judgments of a kind Congress typically makes, judgments we cannot dismiss as outside the Legislature&#x92;s domain.  As respondent describes, see Brief for Respondent 37&#x96;38, a key factor in the CTEA&#x92;s passage was a 1993 European Union (EU) directive instructing EU members to establish a copyright term of life plus 70 years.  EU Council Directive 93/98, p. 4; see 144 Cong. Rec. S12377&#x96;S12378 (daily ed. Oct. 12, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch).  Consistent with the Berne Convention, the EU directed its members to deny this longer term to the works of any non-EU country whose laws did not secure the same extended term.  See Berne Conv. Art. 7(8); P. Goldstein, International Copyright &#xA7;5.3, p. 239 (2001).  By extending the baseline United States copyright term to life plus 70 years, Congress sought to ensure that American authors would receive the same copyright protection in Europe as their European counterparts.

				In sum, we find that the CTEA is a rational enactment; we are not at liberty to second-guess congressional determinations and policy judgments of this order, however debatable or arguably unwise they may be.  Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the CTEA&#x97;which continues the unbroken congressional practice of treating future and existing copyrights in parity for term extension purposes&#x97;is an impermissible exercise of Congress&#x92; power under the Copyright Clause.

				Petitioners dominantly advance a series of arguments all premised on the proposition that Congress may not extend an existing copyright absent new consideration from the author.  They pursue this main theme under three headings.  Petitioners contend that the CTEA&#x92;s extension of existing copyrights (1) overlooks the requirement of &#x93;originality,&#x94; (2) fails to &#x93;promote the Progress of Science,&#x94; and (3) ignores copyright&#x92;s

				 at 359.  Relying on 
				<em>

				More forcibly, petitioners contend that the CTEA&#x92;s extension of existing copyrights does not &#x93;promote the Progress of Science&#x94; as contemplated by the preambular language of the Copyright Clause.  Art. I, &#xA7;8, cl. 8.  To sustain this objection, petitioners do not argue that the Clause&#x92;s preamble is an independently enforceable limit on Congress&#x92; power.  See 239 F. 3d, at 378 (Petitioners acknowledge that &#x93;the preamble of the Copyright Clause is not a substantive limit on Congress&#x92; legislative power.&#x94; (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Rather, they maintain that the preambular language identifies the sole end to which Congress may legislate; accordingly, they conclude, the meaning of &#x93;limited Times&#x94; must be &#x93;determined in light of that specified end.&#x94;  Brief for Petitioners 19.  The CTEA&#x92;s extension of existing copyrights categorically fails to &#x93;promote the Progress of Science,&#x94; petitioners argue, because it does not stimulate the creation of new works but merely adds value to works already created.

				Closely related to petitioners&#x92; preambular argument, or a variant of it, is their assertion that the Copyright Clause &#x93;imbeds a quid pro quo.&#x94;  Brief for Petitioners 23.  They contend, in this regard, that Congress may grant to an &#x93;Autho[r]&#x94; an &#x93;exclusive Right&#x94; for a &#x93;limited Tim[e],&#x94; but only in exchange for a &#x93;Writin[g].&#x94;  Congress&#x92; power to confer copyright protection, petitioners argue, is thus contingent upon an exchange: The author of an original work receives an &#x93;exclusive Right&#x94; for a &#x93;limited Tim[e]&#x94; in exchange for a dedication to the public thereafter.  Extending an existing copyright without demanding additional consideration, petitioners maintain, bestows an unpaid-for benefit on copyright holders and their heirs, in violation of the 
				<em>
					quid pro quo
				</em>
				 requirement.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We can demur to petitioners&#x92; description of the Copyright Clause as a grant of legislative authority empowering Congress &#x93;to secure a bargain&#x97;this for that.&#x94;  Brief for Petitioners 16; see

 (&#x93;The economic philosophy behind the clause empowering Congress to grant patents and copyrights is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors in &#x91;Science and useful Arts.&#x92; &#x94;).  But the legislative evolution earlier recalled demonstrates what the bargain entails.  Given the consistent placement of existing copyright holders in parity with future holders, the author of a work created in the last 170 years would reasonably comprehend, as the &#x93;this&#x94; offered her, a copyright not only for the time in place when protection is gained, but also for any renewal or extension legislated during that time.

				  Congress could rationally seek to &#x93;promote &#x2026; Progress&#x94; by including in every copyright statute an express guarantee that authors would receive the benefit of any later legislative extension of the copyright term.  Nothing in the Copyright Clause bars Congress from creating the same incentive by adopting the same position as a matter of unbroken practice.  See Brief for Respondent 31&#x96;32.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> were adopted close in time.  This proximity indicates that, in the Framers&#x92; view, copyright&#x92;s limited monopolies are compatible with free speech principles.  Indeed, copyright&#x92;s purpose is to 
				<em>
					promote
				</em>
				 the creation and publication of free expression.  As 
				<em>
					Harper &amp; Row
				</em>
				 observed: &#x93;[T]he Framers intended copyright itself to be the engine of free expression.  By establishing a marketable right to the use of one&#x92;s expression, copyright supplies the economic incentive to create and disseminate ideas.&#x94;  471 U. S., at 558.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In addition to spurring the creation and publication of new expression, copyright law contains built-in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> accommodations.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 560.  First, it distinguishes between ideas and expression and makes only the latter eligible for copyright protection.  Specifically, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/102.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">17 U. S. C. &#xA7;102(b)</a> provides: &#x93;In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.&#x94;  As we said in 
				<em>
					Harper &amp; Row
				</em>
				, this &#x93;idea/expression dichotomy strike[s] a definitional balance between the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> and the Copyright Act by permitting free communication of facts while still protecting an author&#x92;s expression.&#x94;  471 U. S., at 556 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Due to this distinction, every idea, theory, and fact in a copyrighted work becomes instantly available for public exploitation at the moment of publication.  See

				Second, the &#x93;fair use&#x94; defense allows the public to use not only facts and ideas contained in a copyrighted work, but also expression itself in certain circumstances.  Codified at 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html" class="subref" title="subref">17 U. S.

				The CTEA itself supplements these traditional

First, it allows libraries, archives, and similar institutions to &#x93;reproduce&#x94; and &#x93;distribute, display, or perform in facsimile or digital form&#x94; copies of certain published works &#x93;during the last 20 years of any term of copyright &#x2026; for purposes of preservation, scholarship, or research&#x94; if the work is not already being exploited commercially and further copies are unavailable at a reasonable price.

				<em>
					Turner
				</em>
				 required cable operators to carry and transmit broadcast stations through their proprietary cable systems.  Those &#x93;must-carry&#x94; provisions, we explained, implicated &#x93;the heart of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>,&#x94; namely, &#x93;the principle that each person should decide for himself or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and adherence.&#x94;

				The CTEA, in contrast, does not oblige anyone to reproduce another&#x92;s speech against the carrier&#x92;s will.  Instead, it protects authors&#x92; original expression from unrestricted exploitation.  Protection of that order does not raise the free speech concerns present when the government compels or burdens the communication of particular facts or ideas.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> securely protects the freedom to make&#x97;or decline to make&#x97;one&#x92;s own speech; it bears less heavily when speakers assert the right to make other people&#x92;s speeches.  To the extent such assertions raise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> concerns, copyright&#x92;s built-in free speech safeguards are generally adequate to address them.  We recognize that the D. C. Circuit spoke too broadly when it declared copyrights &#x93;categorically immune from challenges under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.&#x94;  239 F. 3d, at 375.  But when, as in this case, Congress has not altered the traditional contours of copyright protection, further 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> scrutiny is unnecessary.  See

				If petitioners&#x92; vision of the Copyright Clause held sway, it would do more than render the CTEA&#x92;s duration extensions unconstitutional as to existing works.  Indeed, petitioners&#x92; assertion that the provisions of the CTEA are not severable would make the CTEA&#x92;s enlarged terms invalid even as to tomorrow&#x92;s work.  The 1976 Act&#x92;s time extensions, which set the pattern that the CTEA followed, would be vulnerable as well.

				As we read the Framers&#x92; instruction, the Copyright Clause empowers Congress to determine the intellectual property regimes that, overall, in that body&#x92;s judgment, will serve the ends of the Clause.  See

Beneath the facade of their inventive constitutional interpretation, petitioners forcefully urge that Congress pursued very bad policy in prescribing the CTEA&#x92;s long terms.  The wisdom of Congress&#x92; action, however, is not within our province to second guess.  Satisfied that the legislation before us remains inside the domain the Constitution assigns to the First Branch, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

						 Justice Breyer&#x92;s dissent is not similarly restrained.  He makes no effort meaningfully to distinguish existing copyrights from future grants.  See, e.g., post, at 1, 13&#x96;19, 23&#x96;25.  Under his reasoning, the CTEA&#x92;s 20-year extension is globally unconstitutional.

						 Asserting that the last several decades have seen a proliferation of copyright legislation in departure from Congress&#x92; traditional pace of legislative amendment in this area, petitioners cite nine statutes passed between 1962 and 1974, each of which incrementally extended existing copyrights for brief periods.

						 Petitioners argue that the 1790 Act must be distinguished from the later Acts on the ground that it covered existing works but did not extend existing copyrights.  Reply Brief 3&#x96;7.  The parties disagree on the question whether the 1790 Act&#x92;s copyright term should be regarded in part as compensation for the loss of any then existing state- or common-law copyright protections.  See Brief for Petitioners 28&#x96;30; Brief for Respondent 17, n. 9; Reply Brief 3&#x96;7.  Without resolving that dispute, we underscore that the First Congress clearly did confer copyright protection on works that had already been created.

						 We note again that Justice Breyer makes no such concession.  See supra, at 2, n. 1.  He does not train his fire, as petitioners do, on Congress&#x92; choice to place existing and future copyrights in parity.  Moving beyond the bounds of the parties&#x92; presentations, and with abundant policy arguments but precious little support from precedent, he would condemn Congress&#x92; entire product as irrational.

						 This approach comported with English practice at the time.  The Statute of Anne, 1710, 8 Ann. c. 19, provided copyright protection to books not yet composed or published, books already composed but not yet published, and books already composed and published.  See ibid. (&#x93;[T]he author of any book or books already composed, and not printed and published, or that shall hereafter be composed, and his assignee or assigns, shall have the sole liberty of printing and reprinting such book and books for the term of fourteen years, to commence from the day of the first publishing the same, and no longer.&#x94;); ibid.  (&#x93;[T]he author of any book or books already printed &#x2026; or the bookseller or booksellers, printer or printers, or other person or persons, who hath or have purchased or acquired the copy or copies of any book or books, in order to print or reprint the same, shall have the sole right and liberty of printing such book and books for the term of one and twenty years, to commence from the said tenth day of April, and no longer.&#x94;).


Justice Stevens stresses the rejection of a proposed amendment to the Statute of Anne that would have extended the term of existing copyrights, and reports that opponents of the extension feared it would perpetuate the monopoly position enjoyed by English booksellers.  Post, at 12, and n. 9.  But the English Parliament confronted a situation that never existed in the United States.  Through the late 17th century, a government-sanctioned printing monopoly was held by the Stationers&#x92; Company, &#x93;the ancient London guild of printers and booksellers.&#x94;  M. Rose, Authors and Owners: The Invention of Copyright 4 (1993); see L. Patterson, Copyright in Historical Perspective ch. 3 (1968).  Although that legal monopoly ended in 1695, concerns about monopolistic practices remained, and the 18th century English Parliament was resistant to any enhancement of booksellers&#x92; and publishers&#x92; entrenched position.  See Rose, supra, at 52&#x96;56.  In this country, in contrast, competition among publishers, printers, and booksellers was &#x93;intens[e]&#x94; at the time of the founding, and &#x93;there was not even a rough analog to the Stationers&#x92; Company on the horizon.&#x94;  Nachbar, Constructing Copyright&#x92;s Mythology, 6 Green Bag 2d 37, 45 (2002).  The Framers guarded against the future accumulation of monopoly power in booksellers and publishers by authorizing Congress to vest copyrights only in &#x93;Authors.&#x94;  Justice Stevens does not even attempt to explain how Parliament&#x92;s response to England&#x92;s experience with a publishing monopoly may be construed to impose a constitutional limitation on Congress&#x92; power to extend copyrights granted to &#x93;Authors.&#x94;

						 Moreover, the precise duration of a federal copyright has never been fixed at the time of the initial grant.  The 1790 Act provided a federal copyright term of 14 years from the work&#x92;s publication, renewable for an additional 14 years if the author survived and applied for an additional term.  &#xA7;1.  Congress retained that approach in subsequent statutes.  See Stewart v. Abend, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/495/207" class="subref" title="subref">495 U. S. 207</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">217</a> (1990)
 (&#x93;Since the earliest copyright statute in this country, the copyright term of ownership has been split between an original term and a renewal term.&#x94;).  Similarly, under the method for measuring copyright terms established by the 1976 Act and retained by the CTEA, the baseline copyright term is measured in part by the life of the author, rendering its duration indeterminate at the time of the grant.  See 1976 Act &#xA7;302(a);

						 Justice Stevens would sweep away these decisions, asserting that Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/1" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 1</a> (1966)
, &#x93;flatly contradicts&#x94; them.  Post, at 17.  Nothing but wishful thinking underpins that assertion.  The controversy in Graham involved no patent extension.  Graham addressed an invention&#x92;s very eligibility for patent protection, and spent no words on Congress&#x92; power to enlarge a patent&#x92;s duration.

						 Justice Stevens recites words from Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/376/225" class="subref" title="subref">376 U. S. 225</a> (1964)
, supporting the uncontroversial proposition that a State may not &#x93;extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date,&#x94; id., at 231, then boldly asserts that for the same reasons Congress may not do so either.  See post, at 1, 5.  But Sears placed no reins on Congress&#x92; authority to extend a patent&#x92;s life.  The full sentence in Sears, from which Justice Stevens extracts words, reads: &#x93;Obviously a State could not, consistently with the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date or give a patent on an article which lacked the level of invention required for federal patents.&#x94;  376 U. S., at 231.  The point insistently made in Sears is no more and no less than this: States may not enact measures inconsistent with the federal patent laws.  Ibid. (&#x93;[A] State cannot encroach upon the federal patent laws directly &#x2026; [and] cannot &#x2026; give protection of a kind that clashes with the objectives of the federal patent laws.&#x94;).  A decision thus rooted in the Supremacy Clause cannot be turned around to shrink congressional choices.


Also unavailing is Justice Stevens&#x92; appeal to language found in a private letter written by James Madison.  Post, at 9, n. 6; see also dissenting opinion of Breyer, J., post, at 5, 20.  Respondent points to a better &#x93;demonstrat[ion],&#x94; post, at 5, n. 3 (Stevens, J., dissenting), of Madison&#x92;s and other Framers&#x92; understanding of the scope of Congress&#x92; power to extend patents: &#x93;[T]hen-President Thomas Jefferson&#x97;the first administrator of the patent system, and perhaps the Founder with the narrowest view of the copyright and patent powers&#x97;signed the 1808 and 1809 patent term extensions into law; &#x2026; James Madison, who drafted the Constitution&#x92;s &#x91;limited Times&#x92; language, issued the extended patents under those laws as Secretary of State; and &#x2026; Madison as President signed another patent term extension in 1815.&#x94;  Brief for Respondent 15.

						 Justice Stevens reads McClurg to convey that &#x93;Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee.&#x94; Post, at 19.  But McClurg concerned no such change.  To the contrary, as Justice Stevens acknowledges, McClurg held that use of an invention by the patentee&#x92;s employer did not invalidate the inventor&#x92;s 1834 patent, &#x93;even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.&#x94;  Post, at 18.  In other words, McClurg evaluated the patentee&#x92;s rights not simply in light of the patent law in force at the time the patent issued, but also in light of &#x93;such changes as ha[d] been since made.&#x94;  1 How., at 206.  It is thus inescapably plain that McClurg upheld the application of expanded patent protection to an existing patent.

						 Justice Breyer would adopt a heightened, three-part test for the constitutionality of copyright enactments.  Post, at 3.  He would invalidate the CTEA as irrational in part because, in his view, harmonizing the United States and European Union baseline copyright terms &#x93;apparent[ly]&#x94; fails to achieve &#x93;significant&#x94; uniformity.  Post, at 23.  But see infra, at 15.  The novelty of the &#x93;rational basis&#x94; approach he presents is plain.  Cf. Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,

).  Rather than subjecting Congress&#x92; legislative choices in the copyright area to heightened judicial scrutiny, we have stressed that &#x93;it is not our role to alter the delicate balance Congress has labored to achieve.&#x94;  Stewart v.

						 Members of Congress expressed the view that, as a result of increases in human longevity and in parents&#x92; average age when their children are born, the pre-CTEA term did not adequately secure &#x93;the right to profit from licensing one&#x92;s work during one&#x92;s lifetime andto take pride and comfort in knowing that one&#x92;s children&#x97;and per-haps their children&#x97;might also benefit from one&#x92;s posthumous popularity.&#x94;  141 Cong. Rec. 6553 (1995) (statement of Sen. Feinstein); see 144 Cong. Rec. S12377 (daily ed. Oct. 12, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch) (&#x93;Among the main developments [compelling reconsideration of the 1976 Act&#x92;s term] is the effect of demographic trends, such as increasing longevity and the trend toward rearing children later in life, on the effectiveness of the life-plus-50 term to provide adequate protection for American creators and their heirs.&#x94;).  Also cited was &#x93;the failure of the U. S. copyright term to keep pace with the substantially increased commercial life of copyrighted works resulting from the rapid growth in communications media.&#x94;  Ibid. (statement of Sen.

						 Justice Breyer urges that the economic incentives accompanying copyright term extension are too insignificant to &#x93;mov[e]&#x94; any author with a &#x93;rational economic perspective.&#x94;  Post, at 14; see post, at 13&#x96;16.  Calibrating rational economic incentives, however, like &#x93;fashion[ing] &#x2026; new rules [in light of] new technology,&#x94; Sony, 464 U. S., at 431, is a task primarily for Congress, not the courts.  Congress heard testimony from a number of prominent artists; each expressed the belief that the copyright system&#x92;s assurance of fair compensation for themselves and their heirs was an incentive to create.  See, e.g., House Hearings 233&#x96;239 (statement of Quincy Jones); Copyright Term Extension Act of 1995: Hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 55&#x96;56 (1995) (statement of Bob Dylan); id., at 56&#x96;57 (statement of Don Henley); id., at 57 (statement of Carlos Santana).  We would not take Congress to task for crediting this evidence which, as Justice Breyer acknowledges, reflects general &#x93;propositions about the value of incentives&#x94; that are &#x93;undeniably true.&#x94;  Post, at 14. 


Congress also heard testimony from Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters and others regarding the economic incentives created by the CTEA.  According to the Register, extending the copyright for existing works &#x93;could &#x2026; provide additional income that would finance the production and distribution of new works.&#x94;  House Hearings 158.  &#x93;Authors would not be able to continue to create,&#x94; the Register explained, &#x93;unless they earned income on their finished works.  The public benefits not only from an author&#x92;s original work but also from his or her further creations.  Although this truism may be illustrated in many ways, one of the best examples is Noah Webster[,] who supported his entire family from the earnings on his speller and grammar during the twenty years he took to complete his dictionary.&#x94;  Id., at 165.

						 Justice Breyer agrees that &#x93;Congress did not intend to act unconstitutionally&#x94; when it enacted the CTEA, post, at 15, yet in his very next breath, he seems to make just that accusation, ibid.  What else is one to glean from his selection of scattered statements from individual members of Congress?  He does not identify any statement in the statutory text that installs a perpetual copyright, for there is none.  But even if the statutory text were sufficiently ambiguous to warrant recourse to legislative history, Justice Breyer&#x92;s selections are not the sort to which this Court accords high value: &#x93;In surveying legislative history we have repeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding the Legislature&#x92;s intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill, which &#x91;represen[t] the considered and collective understanding of those [members of Congress] involved in drafting and studying proposed legislation.&#x92; &#x94;  Garcia v. United States,

 (quoting Zuber v. Allen, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/396/168" class="subref" title="subref">396 U. S. 168</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">186</a> (1969)
).  The House and Senate Reports accompanying the CTEA reflect no purpose to make copyright a forever thing.  Notably, the Senate Report expressly acknowledged that the Constitution &#x93;clearly precludes Congress from granting unlimited protection for copyrighted works,&#x94; S. Rep. No. 104&#x96;315, p. 11 (1996), and disclaimed any intent to contravene that prohibition, ibid.  Members of Congress instrumental in the CTEA&#x92;s passage spoke to similar effect.  See, e.g., 144 Cong. Rec. H1458 (daily ed. Mar. 25, 1998) (statement of Rep. Coble) (observing that &#x93;copyright protection should be for a limited time only&#x94; and that &#x93;[p]erpetual protection does not benefit society&#x94;).   


Justice Breyer nevertheless insists that the &#x93;economic effect&#x94; of the CTEA is to make the copyright term &#x93;virtually perpetual.&#x94;  Post, at 1.  Relying on formulas and assumptions provided in an amicus brief supporting petitioners, he stresses that the CTEA creates a copyright term worth 99.8% of the value of a perpetual copyright.  Post, at 13&#x96;15.  If Justice Breyer&#x92;s calculations were a basis for holding the CTEA unconstitutional, then the 1976 Act would surely fall as well, for&#x97;under the same assumptions he indulges&#x97;the term set by that Act secures 99.4% of the value of a perpetual term.  See Brief for George A. Akerloff et al. as Amici Curiae 6, n. 6 (describing the relevant formula).  Indeed, on that analysis even the &#x93;limited&#x94; character of the 1909 (97.7%) and 1831 (94.1%) Acts might be suspect.  Justice Breyer several times places the Founding Fathers on his side.  See, e.g., post, at 5, 20.  It is doubtful, however, that those architects of our Nation, in framing the &#x93;limited Times&#x94; prescription, thought in terms of the calculator rather than the calendar.

						 Respondent notes that the CTEA&#x92;s life-plus-70-years baseline term is expected to produce an average copyright duration of 95 years, and that this term &#x93;resembles some other long-accepted durational practices in the law, such as 99-year leases of real property and bequests within the rule against perpetuities.&#x94;  Brief for Respondent 27, n. 18.  Whether such referents mark the outer boundary of &#x93;limited Times&#x94; is not before us today.  Justice Breyer suggests that the CTEA&#x92;s baseline term extends beyond that typically permitted by the traditional rule against perpetuities.  Post, at 15&#x96;16.  The traditional common-law rule looks to lives in being plus 21 years.  Under that rule, the period before a bequest vests could easily equal or exceed the anticipated average copyright term under the CTEA.  If, for example, the vesting period on a deed were defined with reference to the life of an infant, the sum of the measuring life plus 21 years could commonly add up to 95 years.

						 Justice Stevens&#x92; characterization of reward to the author as &#x93;a secondary consideration&#x94; of copyright law, post, at 6, n. 4 (internal quotation marks omitted), understates the relationship between such rewards and the &#x93;Progress of Science.&#x94;  As we have explained, &#x93;[t]he economic philosophy behind the [Copyright] [C]lause &#x2026; is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors.&#x94;  Mazer v. Stein, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/347/201" class="subref" title="subref">347 U. S. 201</a>,

.  Accordingly, &#x93;copyright law celebrates the profit motive, recognizing that the incentive to profit from the exploitation of copyrights will redound to the public benefit by resulting in the proliferation of knowledge&#x2026; .  The profit motive is the engine that ensures the progress of science.&#x94;  American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 802 F. Supp. 1, 27 (SDNY 1992), aff&#x92;d, 60 F. 3d 913 (CA2 1994).  Rewarding authors for their creative labor and &#x93;promot[ing] &#x2026; Progress&#x94; are thus complementary; as James Madison observed, in copyright &#x93;[t]he public good fully coincides &#x2026; with the claims of individuals.&#x94;  The Federalist No. 43, p. 272 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).  Justice Breyer&#x92;s assertion that &#x93;copyright statutes must serve public, not private, ends&#x94; post, at 6, similarly misses the mark.  The two ends are not mutually exclusive; copyright law serves public ends by providing individuals with an incentive to pursue private ones.

						 As we have noted, see supra, at 5, n. 3, petitioners seek to distinguish the 1790 Act from those that followed.  They argue that by requiring authors seeking its protection to surrender whatever rights they had under state law, the 1790 Act enhanced uniformity and certainty and thus &#x93;promote[d] &#x2026; Progress.&#x94;  See Brief for Petitioners 28&#x96;31.  This account of the 1790 Act simply confirms, however, thatthe First Congress understood it could &#x93;promote &#x2026; Progress&#x94; by extending copyright protection to existing works.  Every subsequent adjustment of copyright&#x92;s duration, including the CTEA, reflects a similar understanding.

						 The fact that patent and copyright involve different exchanges does not, of course, mean that we may not be guided in our &#x93;limited Times&#x94; analysis by Congress&#x92; repeated extensions of existing patents.  See supra, at 10&#x96;13.  If patent&#x92;s quid pro quo is more exacting than copyright&#x92;s, then Congress&#x92; repeated extensions of existing patents without constitutional objection suggests even more strongly that similar legislation with respect to copyrights is constitutionally permissible.

						 Petitioners originally framed this argument as implicating the CTEA&#x92;s extension of both existing and future copyrights.  See Pet. for Cert. i.  Now, however, they train on the CTEA&#x92;s extension of existing copyrights and urge against consideration of the CTEA&#x92;s 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> validity as applied to future copyrights.  See Brief for Petitioners 39&#x96;48; Reply Brief 16&#x96;17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11&#x96;13.  We therefore consider petitioners&#x92; argument as so limited.  We note, however, that petitioners do not explain how their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> argument is moored to the prospective/retrospective line they urge us to draw, nor do they say whether or how their free speech argument applies to copyright duration but not to other aspects of copyright protection, notably scope.

				This case concerns the authority the Constitution assigns to Congress to prescribe the duration of copyrights.  The Copyright and Patent Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, &#xA7;8, cl. 8, provides as to copyrights: &#x93;Congress shall have Power &#x2026; [t]o promote the Progress of Science &#x2026; by securing [to Authors] for limited Times &#x2026; the exclusive Right to their &#x2026; Writings.&#x94;  In 1998, in the measure here under inspection, Congress enlarged the duration of copyrights by 20 years.

				In accord with the District Court and the Court of Appeals, we reject petitioners&#x92; challenges to the CTEA.  In that 1998 legislation, as in all previous copyright term extensions, Congress placed existing and future copyrights in parity.  In prescribing that alignment, we hold, Congress acted within its authority and did not transgress constitutional limitations.

				We evaluate petitioners&#x92; challenge to the constitutionality of the CTEA against the backdrop of Congress&#x92; previous exercises of its authority under the Copyright Clause.  The Nation&#x92;s first copyright statute, enacted in 1790, provided a federal copyright term of 14 years from the date of publication, renewable for an additional 14 years if the author survived the first term.  Act of May 31, 1790, ch. 15, &#xA7;1,

				In 1976, Congress altered the method for computing federal copyright terms.  1976 Act &#xA7;&#xA7;302&#x96;304.  For works created by identified natural persons, the 1976 Act provided that federal copyright protection would run from the work&#x92;s creation, not&#x97;as in the 1790, 1831, and 1909 Acts&#x97;its publication; protection would last until 50 years after the author&#x92;s death.  &#xA7;302(a).  In these respects, the 1976 Act aligned United States copyright terms with the then-dominant international standard adopted under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.  See H. R. Rep. No. 94&#x96;1476, p. 135 (1976).  For anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire, the 1976 Act provided a term of 75 years from publication or 100 years from creation, whichever expired first.  &#xA7;302(c).

				  Petitioners contend, however, that existing copyrights extended to endure for that same term are not &#x93;limited.&#x94;  Petitioners&#x92; argument essentially reads into the text of the Copyright Clause the command that a time prescription, once set, becomes forever &#x93;fixed&#x94; or &#x93;inalterable.&#x94;  The word &#x93;limited,&#x94; however, does not convey a meaning so constricted.  At the time of the Framing, that word meant what it means today: &#x93;confine[d] within certain bounds,&#x94; &#x93;restrain[ed],&#x94; or &#x93;circumscribe[d].&#x94;  S.

				Congress&#x92; consistent historical practice of applying newly enacted copyright terms to future and existing copyrights reflects a judgment stated concisely by Representative Huntington at the time of the 1831 Act: &#x93;[J]ustice, policy, and equity alike forb[id]&#x94; that an &#x93;author who had sold his [work] a week ago, be placed in a worse situation than the author who should sell his work the day after the passing of [the] act.&#x94;  7 Cong.

The CTEA follows this historical practice by keeping the duration provisions of the 1976 Act largely in place and simply adding 20 years to each of them.  Guided by text, history, and precedent, we cannot agree with petitioners&#x92; submission that extending the duration of existing copyrights is categorically beyond Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright Clause.

				The CTEA reflects judgments of a kind Congress typically makes, judgments we cannot dismiss as outside the Legislature&#x92;s domain.  As respondent describes, see Brief for Respondent 37&#x96;38, a key factor in the CTEA&#x92;s passage was a 1993 European Union (EU) directive instructing EU members to establish a copyright term of life plus 70 years.  EU Council Directive 93/98, p. 4; see 144 Cong. Rec. S12377&#x96;S12378 (daily ed. Oct. 12, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch).  Consistent with the Berne Convention, the EU directed its members to deny this longer term to the works of any non-EU country whose laws did not secure the same extended term.  See Berne Conv. Art. 7(8); P. Goldstein, International Copyright &#xA7;5.3, p. 239 (2001).  By extending the baseline United States copyright term to life plus 70 years, Congress sought to ensure that American authors would receive the same copyright protection in Europe as their European counterparts.

				Petitioners dominantly advance a series of arguments all premised on the proposition that Congress may not extend an existing copyright absent new consideration from the author.  They pursue this main theme under three headings.  Petitioners contend that the CTEA&#x92;s extension of existing copyrights (1) overlooks the requirement of &#x93;originality,&#x94; (2) fails to &#x93;promote the Progress of Science,&#x94; and (3) ignores copyright&#x92;s

				 at 359.  Relying on 
				<em>

				More forcibly, petitioners contend that the CTEA&#x92;s extension of existing copyrights does not &#x93;promote the Progress of Science&#x94; as contemplated by the preambular language of the Copyright Clause.  Art. I, &#xA7;8, cl. 8.  To sustain this objection, petitioners do not argue that the Clause&#x92;s preamble is an independently enforceable limit on Congress&#x92; power.  See 239 F. 3d, at 378 (Petitioners acknowledge that &#x93;the preamble of the Copyright Clause is not a substantive limit on Congress&#x92; legislative power.&#x94; (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Rather, they maintain that the preambular language identifies the sole end to which Congress may legislate; accordingly, they conclude, the meaning of &#x93;limited Times&#x94; must be &#x93;determined in light of that specified end.&#x94;  Brief for Petitioners 19.  The CTEA&#x92;s extension of existing copyrights categorically fails to &#x93;promote the Progress of Science,&#x94; petitioners argue, because it does not stimulate the creation of new works but merely adds value to works already created.

				Closely related to petitioners&#x92; preambular argument, or a variant of it, is their assertion that the Copyright Clause &#x93;imbeds a quid pro quo.&#x94;  Brief for Petitioners 23.  They contend, in this regard, that Congress may grant to an &#x93;Autho[r]&#x94; an &#x93;exclusive Right&#x94; for a &#x93;limited Tim[e],&#x94; but only in exchange for a &#x93;Writin[g].&#x94;  Congress&#x92; power to confer copyright protection, petitioners argue, is thus contingent upon an exchange: The author of an original work receives an &#x93;exclusive Right&#x94; for a &#x93;limited Tim[e]&#x94; in exchange for a dedication to the public thereafter.  Extending an existing copyright without demanding additional consideration, petitioners maintain, bestows an unpaid-for benefit on copyright holders and their heirs, in violation of the 
				<em>
					quid pro quo
				</em>
				 requirement.

        <p class="bodytext">

 (&#x93;The economic philosophy behind the clause empowering Congress to grant patents and copyrights is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors in &#x91;Science and useful Arts.&#x92; &#x94;).  But the legislative evolution earlier recalled demonstrates what the bargain entails.  Given the consistent placement of existing copyright holders in parity with future holders, the author of a work created in the last 170 years would reasonably comprehend, as the &#x93;this&#x94; offered her, a copyright not only for the time in place when protection is gained, but also for any renewal or extension legislated during that time.

				  Congress could rationally seek to &#x93;promote &#x2026; Progress&#x94; by including in every copyright statute an express guarantee that authors would receive the benefit of any later legislative extension of the copyright term.  Nothing in the Copyright Clause bars Congress from creating the same incentive by adopting the same position as a matter of unbroken practice.  See Brief for Respondent 31&#x96;32.

				The CTEA, in contrast, does not oblige anyone to reproduce another&#x92;s speech against the carrier&#x92;s will.  Instead, it protects authors&#x92; original expression from unrestricted exploitation.  Protection of that order does not raise the free speech concerns present when the government compels or burdens the communication of particular facts or ideas.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> securely protects the freedom to make&#x97;or decline to make&#x97;one&#x92;s own speech; it bears less heavily when speakers assert the right to make other people&#x92;s speeches.  To the extent such assertions raise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> concerns, copyright&#x92;s built-in free speech safeguards are generally adequate to address them.  We recognize that the D. C. Circuit spoke too broadly when it declared copyrights &#x93;categorically immune from challenges under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.&#x94;  239 F. 3d, at 375.  But when, as in this case, Congress has not altered the traditional contours of copyright protection, further 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> scrutiny is unnecessary.  See

				If petitioners&#x92; vision of the Copyright Clause held sway, it would do more than render the CTEA&#x92;s duration extensions unconstitutional as to existing works.  Indeed, petitioners&#x92; assertion that the provisions of the CTEA are not severable would make the CTEA&#x92;s enlarged terms invalid even as to tomorrow&#x92;s work.  The 1976 Act&#x92;s time extensions, which set the pattern that the CTEA followed, would be vulnerable as well.

Beneath the facade of their inventive constitutional interpretation, petitioners forcefully urge that Congress pursued very bad policy in prescribing the CTEA&#x92;s long terms.  The wisdom of Congress&#x92; action, however, is not within our province to second guess.  Satisfied that the legislation before us remains inside the domain the Constitution assigns to the First Branch, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

						 Justice Breyer&#x92;s dissent is not similarly restrained.  He makes no effort meaningfully to distinguish existing copyrights from future grants.  See, e.g., post, at 1, 13&#x96;19, 23&#x96;25.  Under his reasoning, the CTEA&#x92;s 20-year extension is globally unconstitutional.

						 Asserting that the last several decades have seen a proliferation of copyright legislation in departure from Congress&#x92; traditional pace of legislative amendment in this area, petitioners cite nine statutes passed between 1962 and 1974, each of which incrementally extended existing copyrights for brief periods.

						 Petitioners argue that the 1790 Act must be distinguished from the later Acts on the ground that it covered existing works but did not extend existing copyrights.  Reply Brief 3&#x96;7.  The parties disagree on the question whether the 1790 Act&#x92;s copyright term should be regarded in part as compensation for the loss of any then existing state- or common-law copyright protections.  See Brief for Petitioners 28&#x96;30; Brief for Respondent 17, n. 9; Reply Brief 3&#x96;7.  Without resolving that dispute, we underscore that the First Congress clearly did confer copyright protection on works that had already been created.

						 We note again that Justice Breyer makes no such concession.  See supra, at 2, n. 1.  He does not train his fire, as petitioners do, on Congress&#x92; choice to place existing and future copyrights in parity.  Moving beyond the bounds of the parties&#x92; presentations, and with abundant policy arguments but precious little support from precedent, he would condemn Congress&#x92; entire product as irrational.

						 This approach comported with English practice at the time.  The Statute of Anne, 1710, 8 Ann. c. 19, provided copyright protection to books not yet composed or published, books already composed but not yet published, and books already composed and published.  See ibid. (&#x93;[T]he author of any book or books already composed, and not printed and published, or that shall hereafter be composed, and his assignee or assigns, shall have the sole liberty of printing and reprinting such book and books for the term of fourteen years, to commence from the day of the first publishing the same, and no longer.&#x94;); ibid.  (&#x93;[T]he author of any book or books already printed &#x2026; or the bookseller or booksellers, printer or printers, or other person or persons, who hath or have purchased or acquired the copy or copies of any book or books, in order to print or reprint the same, shall have the sole right and liberty of printing such book and books for the term of one and twenty years, to commence from the said tenth day of April, and no longer.&#x94;).


Justice Stevens stresses the rejection of a proposed amendment to the Statute of Anne that would have extended the term of existing copyrights, and reports that opponents of the extension feared it would perpetuate the monopoly position enjoyed by English booksellers.  Post, at 12, and n. 9.  But the English Parliament confronted a situation that never existed in the United States.  Through the late 17th century, a government-sanctioned printing monopoly was held by the Stationers&#x92; Company, &#x93;the ancient London guild of printers and booksellers.&#x94;  M. Rose, Authors and Owners: The Invention of Copyright 4 (1993); see L. Patterson, Copyright in Historical Perspective ch. 3 (1968).  Although that legal monopoly ended in 1695, concerns about monopolistic practices remained, and the 18th century English Parliament was resistant to any enhancement of booksellers&#x92; and publishers&#x92; entrenched position.  See Rose, supra, at 52&#x96;56.  In this country, in contrast, competition among publishers, printers, and booksellers was &#x93;intens[e]&#x94; at the time of the founding, and &#x93;there was not even a rough analog to the Stationers&#x92; Company on the horizon.&#x94;  Nachbar, Constructing Copyright&#x92;s Mythology, 6 Green Bag 2d 37, 45 (2002).  The Framers guarded against the future accumulation of monopoly power in booksellers and publishers by authorizing Congress to vest copyrights only in &#x93;Authors.&#x94;  Justice Stevens does not even attempt to explain how Parliament&#x92;s response to England&#x92;s experience with a publishing monopoly may be construed to impose a constitutional limitation on Congress&#x92; power to extend copyrights granted to &#x93;Authors.&#x94;

						 Moreover, the precise duration of a federal copyright has never been fixed at the time of the initial grant.  The 1790 Act provided a federal copyright term of 14 years from the work&#x92;s publication, renewable for an additional 14 years if the author survived and applied for an additional term.  &#xA7;1.  Congress retained that approach in subsequent statutes.  See Stewart v. Abend, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/495/207" class="subref" title="subref">495 U. S. 207</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">217</a> (1990)
 (&#x93;Since the earliest copyright statute in this country, the copyright term of ownership has been split between an original term and a renewal term.&#x94;).  Similarly, under the method for measuring copyright terms established by the 1976 Act and retained by the CTEA, the baseline copyright term is measured in part by the life of the author, rendering its duration indeterminate at the time of the grant.  See 1976 Act &#xA7;302(a);

						 Justice Stevens would sweep away these decisions, asserting that Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/1" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 1</a> (1966)
, &#x93;flatly contradicts&#x94; them.  Post, at 17.  Nothing but wishful thinking underpins that assertion.  The controversy in Graham involved no patent extension.  Graham addressed an invention&#x92;s very eligibility for patent protection, and spent no words on Congress&#x92; power to enlarge a patent&#x92;s duration.

						 Justice Stevens recites words from Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/376/225" class="subref" title="subref">376 U. S. 225</a> (1964)
, supporting the uncontroversial proposition that a State may not &#x93;extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date,&#x94; id., at 231, then boldly asserts that for the same reasons Congress may not do so either.  See post, at 1, 5.  But Sears placed no reins on Congress&#x92; authority to extend a patent&#x92;s life.  The full sentence in Sears, from which Justice Stevens extracts words, reads: &#x93;Obviously a State could not, consistently with the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date or give a patent on an article which lacked the level of invention required for federal patents.&#x94;  376 U. S., at 231.  The point insistently made in Sears is no more and no less than this: States may not enact measures inconsistent with the federal patent laws.  Ibid. (&#x93;[A] State cannot encroach upon the federal patent laws directly &#x2026; [and] cannot &#x2026; give protection of a kind that clashes with the objectives of the federal patent laws.&#x94;).  A decision thus rooted in the Supremacy Clause cannot be turned around to shrink congressional choices.


Also unavailing is Justice Stevens&#x92; appeal to language found in a private letter written by James Madison.  Post, at 9, n. 6; see also dissenting opinion of Breyer, J., post, at 5, 20.  Respondent points to a better &#x93;demonstrat[ion],&#x94; post, at 5, n. 3 (Stevens, J., dissenting), of Madison&#x92;s and other Framers&#x92; understanding of the scope of Congress&#x92; power to extend patents: &#x93;[T]hen-President Thomas Jefferson&#x97;the first administrator of the patent system, and perhaps the Founder with the narrowest view of the copyright and patent powers&#x97;signed the 1808 and 1809 patent term extensions into law; &#x2026; James Madison, who drafted the Constitution&#x92;s &#x91;limited Times&#x92; language, issued the extended patents under those laws as Secretary of State; and &#x2026; Madison as President signed another patent term extension in 1815.&#x94;  Brief for Respondent 15.

						 Justice Stevens reads McClurg to convey that &#x93;Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee.&#x94; Post, at 19.  But McClurg concerned no such change.  To the contrary, as Justice Stevens acknowledges, McClurg held that use of an invention by the patentee&#x92;s employer did not invalidate the inventor&#x92;s 1834 patent, &#x93;even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.&#x94;  Post, at 18.  In other words, McClurg evaluated the patentee&#x92;s rights not simply in light of the patent law in force at the time the patent issued, but also in light of &#x93;such changes as ha[d] been since made.&#x94;  1 How., at 206.  It is thus inescapably plain that McClurg upheld the application of expanded patent protection to an existing patent.

						 Justice Breyer would adopt a heightened, three-part test for the constitutionality of copyright enactments.  Post, at 3.  He would invalidate the CTEA as irrational in part because, in his view, harmonizing the United States and European Union baseline copyright terms &#x93;apparent[ly]&#x94; fails to achieve &#x93;significant&#x94; uniformity.  Post, at 23.  But see infra, at 15.  The novelty of the &#x93;rational basis&#x94; approach he presents is plain.  Cf. Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,

).  Rather than subjecting Congress&#x92; legislative choices in the copyright area to heightened judicial scrutiny, we have stressed that &#x93;it is not our role to alter the delicate balance Congress has labored to achieve.&#x94;  Stewart v.

						 Members of Congress expressed the view that, as a result of increases in human longevity and in parents&#x92; average age when their children are born, the pre-CTEA term did not adequately secure &#x93;the right to profit from licensing one&#x92;s work during one&#x92;s lifetime andto take pride and comfort in knowing that one&#x92;s children&#x97;and per-haps their children&#x97;might also benefit from one&#x92;s posthumous popularity.&#x94;  141 Cong.

						 Justice Breyer urges that the economic incentives accompanying copyright term extension are too insignificant to &#x93;mov[e]&#x94; any author with a &#x93;rational economic perspective.&#x94;  Post, at 14; see post, at 13&#x96;16.  Calibrating rational economic incentives, however, like &#x93;fashion[ing] &#x2026; new rules [in light of] new technology,&#x94; Sony, 464 U. S., at 431, is a task primarily for Congress, not the courts.  Congress heard testimony from a number of prominent artists; each expressed the belief that the copyright system&#x92;s assurance of fair compensation for themselves and their heirs was an incentive to create.  See, e.g., House Hearings 233&#x96;239 (statement of Quincy Jones); Copyright Term Extension Act of 1995: Hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 55&#x96;56 (1995) (statement of Bob Dylan); id., at 56&#x96;57 (statement of Don Henley); id., at 57 (statement of Carlos Santana).  We would not take Congress to task for crediting this evidence which, as Justice Breyer acknowledges, reflects general &#x93;propositions about the value of incentives&#x94; that are &#x93;undeniably true.&#x94;  Post, at 14. 


Congress also heard testimony from Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters and others regarding the economic incentives created by the CTEA.  According to the Register, extending the copyright for existing works &#x93;could &#x2026; provide additional income that would finance the production and distribution of new works.&#x94;  House Hearings 158.  &#x93;Authors would not be able to continue to create,&#x94; the Register explained, &#x93;unless they earned income on their finished works.  The public benefits not only from an author&#x92;s original work but also from his or her further creations.  Although this truism may be illustrated in many ways, one of the best examples is Noah Webster[,] who supported his entire family from the earnings on his speller and grammar during the twenty years he took to complete his dictionary.&#x94;  Id., at 165.

						 Justice Breyer agrees that &#x93;Congress did not intend to act unconstitutionally&#x94; when it enacted the CTEA, post, at 15, yet in his very next breath, he seems to make just that accusation, ibid.  What else is one to glean from his selection of scattered statements from individual members of Congress?  He does not identify any statement in the statutory text that installs a perpetual copyright, for there is none.  But even if the statutory text were sufficiently ambiguous to warrant recourse to legislative history, Justice Breyer&#x92;s selections are not the sort to which this Court accords high value: &#x93;In surveying legislative history we have repeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding the Legislature&#x92;s intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill, which &#x91;represen[t] the considered and collective understanding of those [members of Congress] involved in drafting and studying proposed legislation.&#x92; &#x94;  Garcia v.

 (quoting Zuber v. Allen, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/396/168" class="subref" title="subref">396 U. S. 168</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">186</a> (1969)
).  The House and Senate Reports accompanying the CTEA reflect no purpose to make copyright a forever thing.  Notably, the Senate Report expressly acknowledged that the Constitution &#x93;clearly precludes Congress from granting unlimited protection for copyrighted works,&#x94; S. Rep. No. 104&#x96;315, p. 11 (1996), and disclaimed any intent to contravene that prohibition, ibid.  Members of Congress instrumental in the CTEA&#x92;s passage spoke to similar effect.  See, e.g., 144 Cong. Rec. H1458 (daily ed. Mar. 25, 1998) (statement of Rep. Coble) (observing that &#x93;copyright protection should be for a limited time only&#x94; and that &#x93;[p]erpetual protection does not benefit society&#x94;).   


Justice Breyer nevertheless insists that the &#x93;economic effect&#x94; of the CTEA is to make the copyright term &#x93;virtually perpetual.&#x94;  Post, at 1.  Relying on formulas and assumptions provided in an amicus brief supporting petitioners, he stresses that the CTEA creates a copyright term worth 99.8% of the value of a perpetual copyright.  Post, at 13&#x96;15.  If Justice Breyer&#x92;s calculations were a basis for holding the CTEA unconstitutional, then the 1976 Act would surely fall as well, for&#x97;under the same assumptions he indulges&#x97;the term set by that Act secures 99.4% of the value of a perpetual term.  See Brief for George A. Akerloff et al. as Amici Curiae 6, n. 6 (describing the relevant formula).  Indeed, on that analysis even the &#x93;limited&#x94; character of the 1909 (97.7%) and 1831 (94.1%) Acts might be suspect.  Justice Breyer several times places the Founding Fathers on his side.  See, e.g., post, at 5, 20.  It is doubtful, however, that those architects of our Nation, in framing the &#x93;limited Times&#x94; prescription, thought in terms of the calculator rather than the calendar.

						 Respondent notes that the CTEA&#x92;s life-plus-70-years baseline term is expected to produce an average copyright duration of 95 years, and that this term &#x93;resembles some other long-accepted durational practices in the law, such as 99-year leases of real property and bequests within the rule against perpetuities.&#x94;  Brief for Respondent 27, n. 18.  Whether such referents mark the outer boundary of &#x93;limited Times&#x94; is not before us today.  Justice Breyer suggests that the CTEA&#x92;s baseline term extends beyond that typically permitted by the traditional rule against perpetuities.  Post, at 15&#x96;16.  The traditional common-law rule looks to lives in being plus 21 years.  Under that rule, the period before a bequest vests could easily equal or exceed the anticipated average copyright term under the CTEA.  If, for example, the vesting period on a deed were defined with reference to the life of an infant, the sum of the measuring life plus 21 years could commonly add up to 95 years.

						 Justice Stevens&#x92; characterization of reward to the author as &#x93;a secondary consideration&#x94; of copyright law, post, at 6, n. 4 (internal quotation marks omitted), understates the relationship between such rewards and the &#x93;Progress of Science.&#x94;  As we have explained, &#x93;[t]he economic philosophy behind the [Copyright] [C]lause &#x2026; is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors.&#x94;  Mazer v.

.  Accordingly, &#x93;copyright law celebrates the profit motive, recognizing that the incentive to profit from the exploitation of copyrights will redound to the public benefit by resulting in the proliferation of knowledge&#x2026; .  The profit motive is the engine that ensures the progress of science.&#x94;  American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 802 F. Supp. 1, 27 (SDNY 1992), aff&#x92;d, 60 F. 3d 913 (CA2 1994).  Rewarding authors for their creative labor and &#x93;promot[ing] &#x2026; Progress&#x94; are thus complementary; as James Madison observed, in copyright &#x93;[t]he public good fully coincides &#x2026; with the claims of individuals.&#x94;  The Federalist No. 43, p. 272 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).  Justice Breyer&#x92;s assertion that &#x93;copyright statutes must serve public, not private, ends&#x94; post, at 6, similarly misses the mark.  The two ends are not mutually exclusive; copyright law serves public ends by providing individuals with an incentive to pursue private ones.

						 As we have noted, see supra, at 5, n. 3, petitioners seek to distinguish the 1790 Act from those that followed.  They argue that by requiring authors seeking its protection to surrender whatever rights they had under state law, the 1790 Act enhanced uniformity and certainty and thus &#x93;promote[d] &#x2026; Progress.&#x94;  See Brief for Petitioners 28&#x96;31.  This account of the 1790 Act simply confirms, however, thatthe First Congress understood it could &#x93;promote &#x2026; Progress&#x94; by extending copyright protection to existing works.  Every subsequent adjustment of copyright&#x92;s duration, including the CTEA, reflects a similar understanding.

						 The fact that patent and copyright involve different exchanges does not, of course, mean that we may not be guided in our &#x93;limited Times&#x94; analysis by Congress&#x92; repeated extensions of existing patents.  See supra, at 10&#x96;13.  If patent&#x92;s quid pro quo is more exacting than copyright&#x92;s, then Congress&#x92; repeated extensions of existing patents without constitutional objection suggests even more strongly that similar legislation with respect to copyrights is constitutionally permissible.

						 Petitioners originally framed this argument as implicating the CTEA&#x92;s extension of both existing and future copyrights.  See Pet. for Cert. i.  Now, however, they train on the CTEA&#x92;s extension of existing copyrights and urge against consideration of the CTEA&#x92;s 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> validity as applied to future copyrights.  See Brief for Petitioners 39&#x96;48; Reply Brief 16&#x96;17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11&#x96;13.  We therefore consider petitioners&#x92; argument as so limited.  We note, however, that petitioners do not explain how their 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> argument is moored to the prospective/retrospective line they urge us to draw, nor do they say whether or how their free speech argument applies to copyright duration but not to other aspects of copyright protection, notably scope.

				This case concerns the authority the Constitution assigns to Congress to prescribe the duration of copyrights.  The Copyright and Patent Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, &#xA7;8, cl. 8, provides as to copyrights: &#x93;Congress shall have Power &#x2026; [t]o promote the Progress of Science &#x2026; by securing [to Authors] for limited Times &#x2026; the exclusive Right to their &#x2026; Writings.&#x94;  In 1998, in the measure here under inspection, Congress enlarged the duration of copyrights by 20 years.

				In accord with the District Court and the Court of Appeals, we reject petitioners&#x92; challenges to the CTEA.  In that 1998 legislation, as in all previous copyright term extensions, Congress placed existing and future copyrights in parity.  In prescribing that alignment, we hold, Congress acted within its authority and did not transgress constitutional limitations.

				We evaluate petitioners&#x92; challenge to the constitutionality of the CTEA against the backdrop of Congress&#x92; previous exercises of its authority under the Copyright Clause.  The Nation&#x92;s first copyright statute, enacted in 1790, provided a federal copyright term of 14 years from the date of publication, renewable for an additional 14 years if the author survived the first term.  Act of May 31, 1790, ch. 15, &#xA7;1, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.

				In 1976, Congress altered the method for computing federal copyright terms.  1976 Act &#xA7;&#xA7;302&#x96;304.  For works created by identified natural persons, the 1976 Act provided that federal copyright protection would run from the work&#x92;s creation, not&#x97;as in the 1790, 1831, and 1909 Acts&#x97;its publication; protection would last until 50 years after the author&#x92;s death.  &#xA7;302(a).  In these respects, the 1976 Act aligned United States copyright terms with the then-dominant international standard adopted under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.  See H. R. Rep. No. 94&#x96;1476, p. 135 (1976).  For anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire, the 1976 Act provided a term of 75 years from publication or 100 years from creation, whichever expired first.  &#xA7;302(c).

				  Petitioners contend, however, that existing copyrights extended to endure for that same term are not &#x93;limited.&#x94;  Petitioners&#x92; argument essentially reads into the text of the Copyright Clause the command that a time prescription, once set, becomes forever &#x93;fixed&#x94; or &#x93;inalterable.&#x94;  The word &#x93;limited,&#x94; however, does not convey a meaning so constricted.  At the time of the Framing, that word meant what it means today: &#x93;confine[d] within certain bounds,&#x94; &#x93;restrain[ed],&#x94; or &#x93;circumscribe[d].&#x94;  S.

				Congress&#x92; consistent historical practice of applying newly enacted copyright terms to future and existing copyrights reflects a judgment stated concisely by Representative Huntington at the time of the 1831 Act: &#x93;[J]ustice, policy, and equity alike forb[id]&#x94; that an &#x93;author who had sold his [work] a week ago, be placed in a worse situation than the author who should sell his work the day after the passing of [the] act.&#x94;  7 Cong. Deb. 424 (1831); accord Symposium, The Constitutionality of Copyright Term Extension, 18 Cardozo Arts &amp; Ent. L. J. 651, 694 (2000) (Prof. Miller) (&#x93;[S]ince 1790, it has indeed been Congress&#x92;s policy that the author of yesterday&#x92;s work should not get a lesser reward than the author of tomorrow&#x92;s work just because Congress passed a statute lengthening the term today.&#x94;).  The CTEA follows this historical practice by keeping the duration provisions of the 1976 Act largely in place and simply adding 20 years to each of them.  Guided by text, history, and precedent, we cannot agree with petitioners&#x92; submission that extending the duration of existing copyrights is categorically beyond Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright Clause.

				The CTEA reflects judgments of a kind Congress typically makes, judgments we cannot dismiss as outside the Legislature&#x92;s domain.  As respondent describes, see Brief for Respondent 37&#x96;38, a key factor in the CTEA&#x92;s passage was a 1993 European Union (EU) directive instructing EU members to establish a copyright term of life plus 70 years.  EU Council Directive 93/98, p. 4; see 144 Cong. Rec. S12377&#x96;S12378 (daily ed. Oct. 12, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch).  Consistent with the Berne Convention, the EU directed its members to deny this longer term to the works of any non-EU country whose laws did not secure the same extended term.  See Berne Conv. Art. 7(8); P. Goldstein, International Copyright &#xA7;5.3, p. 239 (2001).  By extending the baseline United States copyright term to life plus 70 years, Congress sought to ensure that American authors would receive the same copyright protection in Europe as their European counterparts.

See 239 F. 3d, at 378 (Petitioners acknowledge that &#x93;the preamble of the Copyright Clause is not a substantive limit on Congress&#x92; legislative power.&#x94; (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Rather, they maintain that the preambular language identifies the sole end to which Congress may legislate; accordingly, they conclude, the meaning of &#x93;limited Times&#x94; must be &#x93;determined in light of that specified end.&#x94;  Brief for Petitioners 19.  The CTEA&#x92;s extension of existing copyrights categorically fails to &#x93;promote the Progress of Science,&#x94; petitioners argue, because it does not stimulate the creation of new works but merely adds value to works already created.

				Closely related to petitioners&#x92; preambular argument, or a variant of it, is their assertion that the Copyright Clause &#x93;imbeds a quid pro quo.&#x94;  Brief for Petitioners 23.  They contend, in this regard, that Congress may grant to an &#x93;Autho[r]&#x94; an &#x93;exclusive Right&#x94; for a &#x93;limited Tim[e],&#x94; but only in exchange for a &#x93;Writin[g].&#x94;  Congress&#x92; power to confer copyright protection, petitioners argue, is thus contingent upon an exchange: The author of an original work receives an &#x93;exclusive Right&#x94; for a &#x93;limited Tim[e]&#x94; in exchange for a dedication to the public thereafter.  Extending an existing copyright without demanding additional consideration, petitioners maintain, bestows an unpaid-for benefit on copyright holders and their heirs, in violation of the 
				<em>
					quid pro quo
				</em>
				 requirement.

        <p class="bodytext">

 (&#x93;The economic philosophy behind the clause empowering Congress to grant patents and copyrights is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors in &#x91;Science and useful Arts.&#x92; &#x94;).  But the legislative evolution earlier recalled demonstrates what the bargain entails.  Given the consistent placement of existing copyright holders in parity with future holders, the author of a work created in the last 170 years would reasonably comprehend, as the &#x93;this&#x94; offered her, a copyright not only for the time in place when protection is gained, but also for any renewal or extension legislated during that time.

				  Congress could rationally seek to &#x93;promote &#x2026; Progress&#x94; by including in every copyright statute an express guarantee that authors would receive the benefit of any later legislative extension of the copyright term.  Nothing in the Copyright Clause bars Congress from creating the same incentive by adopting the same position as a matter of unbroken practice.  See Brief for Respondent 31&#x96;32.

				  We reject petitioners&#x92; plea for imposition of uncommonly strict scrutiny on a copyright scheme that incorporates its own speech-protective purposes and safeguards.  The Copyright Clause and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> were adopted close in time.  This proximity indicates that, in the Framers&#x92; view, copyright&#x92;s limited monopolies are compatible with free speech principles.  Indeed, copyright&#x92;s purpose is to 
				<em>
					promote
				</em>
				 the creation and publication of free expression.  As 
				<em>
					Harper &amp; Row
				</em>
				 observed: &#x93;[T]he Framers intended copyright itself to be the engine of free expression.  By establishing a marketable right to the use of one&#x92;s expression, copyright supplies the economic incentive to create and disseminate ideas.&#x94;  471 U. S., at 558.

				In addition to spurring the creation and publication of new expression, copyright law contains built-in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> accommodations.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 560.  First, it distinguishes between ideas and expression and makes only the latter eligible for copyright protection.  Specifically, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/102.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">17 U. S. C. &#xA7;102(b)</a> provides: &#x93;In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.&#x94;  As we said in 
				<em>
					Harper &amp; Row
				</em>
				, this &#x93;idea/expression dichotomy strike[s] a definitional balance between the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> and the Copyright Act by permitting free communication of facts while still protecting an author&#x92;s expression.&#x94;  471 U.

Due to this distinction, every idea, theory, and fact in a copyrighted work becomes instantly available for public exploitation at the moment of publication.  See

				The CTEA, in contrast, does not oblige anyone to reproduce another&#x92;s speech against the carrier&#x92;s will.  Instead, it protects authors&#x92; original expression from unrestricted exploitation.  Protection of that order does not raise the free speech concerns present when the government compels or burdens the communication of particular facts or ideas.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> securely protects the freedom to make&#x97;or decline to make&#x97;one&#x92;s own speech; it bears less heavily when speakers assert the right to make other people&#x92;s speeches.  To the extent such assertions raise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> concerns, copyright&#x92;s built-in free speech safeguards are generally adequate to address them.  We recognize that the D. C. Circuit spoke too broadly when it declared copyrights &#x93;categorically immune from challenges under the

				If petitioners&#x92; vision of the Copyright Clause held sway, it would do more than render the CTEA&#x92;s duration extensions unconstitutional as to existing works.  Indeed, petitioners&#x92; assertion that the provisions of the CTEA are not severable would make the CTEA&#x92;s enlarged terms invalid even as to tomorrow&#x92;s work.  The 1976 Act&#x92;s time extensions, which set the pattern that the CTEA followed, would be vulnerable as well.

						 Justice Breyer&#x92;s dissent is not similarly restrained.  He makes no effort meaningfully to distinguish existing copyrights from future grants.  See, e.g., post, at 1, 13&#x96;19, 23&#x96;25.  Under his reasoning, the CTEA&#x92;s 20-year extension is globally unconstitutional.

						 Asserting that the last several decades have seen a proliferation of copyright legislation in departure from Congress&#x92; traditional pace of legislative amendment in this area, petitioners cite nine statutes passed between 1962 and 1974, each of which incrementally extended existing copyrights for brief periods.

						 Petitioners argue that the 1790 Act must be distinguished from the later Acts on the ground that it covered existing works but did not extend existing copyrights.  Reply Brief 3&#x96;7.  The parties disagree on the question whether the 1790 Act&#x92;s copyright term should be regarded in part as compensation for the loss of any then existing state- or common-law copyright protections.  See Brief for Petitioners 28&#x96;30; Brief for Respondent 17, n. 9; Reply Brief 3&#x96;7.  Without resolving that dispute, we underscore that the First Congress clearly did confer copyright protection on works that had already been created.

						 We note again that Justice Breyer makes no such concession.  See supra, at 2, n. 1.  He does not train his fire, as petitioners do, on Congress&#x92; choice to place existing and future copyrights in parity.  Moving beyond the bounds of the parties&#x92; presentations, and with abundant policy arguments but precious little support from precedent, he would condemn Congress&#x92; entire product as irrational.

						 This approach comported with English practice at the time.  The Statute of Anne, 1710, 8 Ann. c. 19, provided copyright protection to books not yet composed or published, books already composed but not yet published, and books already composed and published.  See ibid. (&#x93;[T]he author of any book or books already composed, and not printed and published, or that shall hereafter be composed, and his assignee or assigns, shall have the sole liberty of printing and reprinting such book and books for the term of fourteen years, to commence from the day of the first publishing the same, and no longer.&#x94;); ibid.  (&#x93;[T]he author of any book or books already printed &#x2026; or the bookseller or booksellers, printer or printers, or other person or persons, who hath or have purchased or acquired the copy or copies of any book or books, in order to print or reprint the same, shall have the sole right and liberty of printing such book and books for the term of one and twenty years, to commence from the said tenth day of April, and no longer.&#x94;).


Justice Stevens stresses the rejection of a proposed amendment to the Statute of Anne that would have extended the term of existing copyrights, and reports that opponents of the extension feared it would perpetuate the monopoly position enjoyed by English booksellers.  Post, at 12, and n. 9.  But the English Parliament confronted a situation that never existed in the United States.  Through the late 17th century, a government-sanctioned printing monopoly was held by the Stationers&#x92; Company, &#x93;the ancient London guild of printers and booksellers.&#x94;  M. Rose, Authors and Owners: The Invention of Copyright 4 (1993); see L. Patterson, Copyright in Historical Perspective ch. 3 (1968).  Although that legal monopoly ended in 1695, concerns about monopolistic practices remained, and the 18th century English Parliament was resistant to any enhancement of booksellers&#x92; and publishers&#x92; entrenched position.  See Rose, supra, at 52&#x96;56.  In this country, in contrast, competition among publishers, printers, and booksellers was &#x93;intens[e]&#x94; at the time of the founding, and &#x93;there was not even a rough analog to the Stationers&#x92; Company on the horizon.&#x94;  Nachbar, Constructing Copyright&#x92;s Mythology, 6 Green Bag 2d 37, 45 (2002).  The Framers guarded against the future accumulation of monopoly power in booksellers and publishers by authorizing Congress to vest copyrights only in &#x93;Authors.&#x94;  Justice Stevens does not even attempt to explain how Parliament&#x92;s response to England&#x92;s experience with a publishing monopoly may be construed to impose a constitutional limitation on Congress&#x92; power to extend copyrights granted to &#x93;Authors.&#x94;

						 Moreover, the precise duration of a federal copyright has never been fixed at the time of the initial grant.  The 1790 Act provided a federal copyright term of 14 years from the work&#x92;s publication, renewable for an additional 14 years if the author survived and applied for an additional term.  &#xA7;1.  Congress retained that approach in subsequent statutes.  See Stewart v. Abend, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/495/207" class="subref" title="subref">495 U. S. 207</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">217</a> (1990)
 (&#x93;Since the earliest copyright statute in this country, the copyright term of ownership has been split between an original term and a renewal term.&#x94;).  Similarly, under the method for measuring copyright terms established by the 1976 Act and retained by the CTEA, the baseline copyright term is measured in part by the life of the author, rendering its duration indeterminate at the time of the grant.  See 1976 Act &#xA7;302(a);

						 Justice Stevens would sweep away these decisions, asserting that Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/1" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 1</a> (1966)
, &#x93;flatly contradicts&#x94; them.  Post, at 17.  Nothing but wishful thinking underpins that assertion.  The controversy in Graham involved no patent extension.  Graham addressed an invention&#x92;s very eligibility for patent protection, and spent no words on Congress&#x92; power to enlarge a patent&#x92;s duration.

						 Justice Stevens recites words from Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/376/225" class="subref" title="subref">376 U. S. 225</a> (1964)
, supporting the uncontroversial proposition that a State may not &#x93;extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date,&#x94; id., at 231, then boldly asserts that for the same reasons Congress may not do so either.  See post, at 1, 5.  But Sears placed no reins on Congress&#x92; authority to extend a patent&#x92;s life.  The full sentence in Sears, from which Justice Stevens extracts words, reads: &#x93;Obviously a State could not, consistently with the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date or give a patent on an article which lacked the level of invention required for federal patents.&#x94;  376 U. S., at 231.  The point insistently made in Sears is no more and no less than this: States may not enact measures inconsistent with the federal patent laws.  Ibid. (&#x93;[A] State cannot encroach upon the federal patent laws directly &#x2026; [and] cannot &#x2026; give protection of a kind that clashes with the objectives of the federal patent laws.&#x94;).  A decision thus rooted in the Supremacy Clause cannot be turned around to shrink congressional choices.


Also unavailing is Justice Stevens&#x92; appeal to language found in a private letter written by James Madison.  Post, at 9, n. 6; see also dissenting opinion of Breyer, J., post, at 5, 20.  Respondent points to a better &#x93;demonstrat[ion],&#x94; post, at 5, n. 3 (Stevens, J., dissenting), of Madison&#x92;s and other Framers&#x92; understanding of the scope of Congress&#x92; power to extend patents: &#x93;[T]hen-President Thomas Jefferson&#x97;the first administrator of the patent system, and perhaps the Founder with the narrowest view of the copyright and patent powers&#x97;signed the 1808 and 1809 patent term extensions into law; &#x2026; James Madison, who drafted the Constitution&#x92;s &#x91;limited Times&#x92; language, issued the extended patents under those laws as Secretary of State; and &#x2026; Madison as President signed another patent term extension in 1815.&#x94;  Brief for Respondent 15.

						 Justice Stevens reads McClurg to convey that &#x93;Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee.&#x94; Post, at 19.  But McClurg concerned no such change.  To the contrary, as Justice Stevens acknowledges, McClurg held that use of an invention by the patentee&#x92;s employer did not invalidate the inventor&#x92;s 1834 patent, &#x93;even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.&#x94;  Post, at 18.  In other words, McClurg evaluated the patentee&#x92;s rights not simply in light of the patent law in force at the time the patent issued, but also in light of &#x93;such changes as ha[d] been since made.&#x94;  1 How., at 206.  It is thus inescapably plain that McClurg upheld the application of expanded patent protection to an existing patent.

						 Justice Breyer would adopt a heightened, three-part test for the constitutionality of copyright enactments.  Post, at 3.  He would invalidate the CTEA as irrational in part because, in his view, harmonizing the United States and European Union baseline copyright terms &#x93;apparent[ly]&#x94; fails to achieve &#x93;significant&#x94; uniformity.  Post, at 23.  But see infra, at 15.  The novelty of the &#x93;rational basis&#x94; approach he presents is plain.  Cf. Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,

).  Rather than subjecting Congress&#x92; legislative choices in the copyright area to heightened judicial scrutiny, we have stressed that &#x93;it is not our role to alter the delicate balance Congress has labored to achieve.&#x94;  Stewart v.

						 Members of Congress expressed the view that, as a result of increases in human longevity and in parents&#x92; average age when their children are born, the pre-CTEA term did not adequately secure &#x93;the right to profit from licensing one&#x92;s work during one&#x92;s lifetime andto take pride and comfort in knowing that one&#x92;s children&#x97;and per-haps their children&#x97;might also benefit from one&#x92;s posthumous popularity.&#x94;  141 Cong.

						 Justice Breyer urges that the economic incentives accompanying copyright term extension are too insignificant to &#x93;mov[e]&#x94; any author with a &#x93;rational economic perspective.&#x94;  Post, at 14; see post, at 13&#x96;16.  Calibrating rational economic incentives, however, like &#x93;fashion[ing] &#x2026; new rules [in light of] new technology,&#x94; Sony, 464 U. S., at 431, is a task primarily for Congress, not the courts.  Congress heard testimony from a number of prominent artists; each expressed the belief that the copyright system&#x92;s assurance of fair compensation for themselves and their heirs was an incentive to create.  See, e.g., House Hearings 233&#x96;239 (statement of Quincy Jones); Copyright Term Extension Act of 1995: Hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 55&#x96;56 (1995) (statement of Bob Dylan); id., at 56&#x96;57 (statement of Don Henley); id., at 57 (statement of Carlos Santana).  We would not take Congress to task for crediting this evidence which, as Justice Breyer acknowledges, reflects general &#x93;propositions about the value of incentives&#x94; that are &#x93;undeniably true.&#x94;  Post, at 14. 


Congress also heard testimony from Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters and others regarding the economic incentives created by the CTEA.  According to the Register, extending the copyright for existing works &#x93;could &#x2026; provide additional income that would finance the production and distribution of new works.&#x94;  House Hearings 158.  &#x93;Authors would not be able to continue to create,&#x94; the Register explained, &#x93;unless they earned income on their finished works.  The public benefits not only from an author&#x92;s original work but also from his or her further creations.  Although this truism may be illustrated in many ways, one of the best examples is Noah Webster[,] who supported his entire family from the earnings on his speller and grammar during the twenty years he took to complete his dictionary.&#x94;  Id., at 165.

						 Justice Breyer agrees that &#x93;Congress did not intend to act unconstitutionally&#x94; when it enacted the CTEA, post, at 15, yet in his very next breath, he seems to make just that accusation, ibid.  What else is one to glean from his selection of scattered statements from individual members of Congress?  He does not identify any statement in the statutory text that installs a perpetual copyright, for there is none.  But even if the statutory text were sufficiently ambiguous to warrant recourse to legislative history, Justice Breyer&#x92;s selections are not the sort to which this Court accords high value: &#x93;In surveying legislative history we have repeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding the Legislature&#x92;s intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill, which &#x91;represen[t] the considered and collective understanding of those [members of Congress] involved in drafting and studying proposed legislation.&#x92; &#x94;  Garcia v.

).  The House and Senate Reports accompanying the CTEA reflect no purpose to make copyright a forever thing.  Notably, the Senate Report expressly acknowledged that the Constitution &#x93;clearly precludes Congress from granting unlimited protection for copyrighted works,&#x94; S. Rep. No. 104&#x96;315, p. 11 (1996), and disclaimed any intent to contravene that prohibition, ibid.  Members of Congress instrumental in the CTEA&#x92;s passage spoke to similar effect.  See, e.g., 144 Cong. Rec. H1458 (daily ed. Mar. 25, 1998) (statement of Rep. Coble) (observing that &#x93;copyright protection should be for a limited time only&#x94; and that &#x93;[p]erpetual protection does not benefit society&#x94;).   


Justice Breyer nevertheless insists that the &#x93;economic effect&#x94; of the CTEA is to make the copyright term &#x93;virtually perpetual.&#x94;  Post, at 1.  Relying on formulas and assumptions provided in an amicus brief supporting petitioners, he stresses that the CTEA creates a copyright term worth 99.8% of the value of a perpetual copyright.  Post, at 13&#x96;15.  If Justice Breyer&#x92;s calculations were a basis for holding the CTEA unconstitutional, then the 1976 Act would surely fall as well, for&#x97;under the same assumptions he indulges&#x97;the term set by that Act secures 99.4% of the value of a perpetual term.  See Brief for George A. Akerloff et al. as Amici Curiae 6, n. 6 (describing the relevant formula).  Indeed, on that analysis even the &#x93;limited&#x94; character of the 1909 (97.7%) and 1831 (94.1%) Acts might be suspect.  Justice Breyer several times places the Founding Fathers on his side.  See, e.g., post, at 5, 20.  It is doubtful, however, that those architects of our Nation, in framing the &#x93;limited Times&#x94; prescription, thought in terms of the calculator rather than the calendar.

						 Respondent notes that the CTEA&#x92;s life-plus-70-years baseline term is expected to produce an average copyright duration of 95 years, and that this term &#x93;resembles some other long-accepted durational practices in the law, such as 99-year leases of real property and bequests within the rule against perpetuities.&#x94;  Brief for Respondent 27, n. 18.  Whether such referents mark the outer boundary of &#x93;limited Times&#x94; is not before us today.  Justice Breyer suggests that the CTEA&#x92;s baseline term extends beyond that typically permitted by the traditional rule against perpetuities.  Post, at 15&#x96;16.  The traditional common-law rule looks to lives in being plus 21 years.  Under that rule, the period before a bequest vests could easily equal or exceed the anticipated average copyright term under the CTEA.  If, for example, the vesting period on a deed were defined with reference to the life of an infant, the sum of the measuring life plus 21 years could commonly add up to 95 years.

						 Justice Stevens&#x92; characterization of reward to the author as &#x93;a secondary consideration&#x94; of copyright law, post, at 6, n. 4 (internal quotation marks omitted), understates the relationship between such rewards and the &#x93;Progress of Science.&#x94;  As we have explained, &#x93;[t]he economic philosophy behind the [Copyright] [C]lause &#x2026; is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors.&#x94;  Mazer v.

.  Accordingly, &#x93;copyright law celebrates the profit motive, recognizing that the incentive to profit from the exploitation of copyrights will redound to the public benefit by resulting in the proliferation of knowledge&#x2026; .  The profit motive is the engine that ensures the progress of science.&#x94;  American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 802 F. Supp. 1, 27 (SDNY 1992), aff&#x92;d, 60 F. 3d 913 (CA2 1994).  Rewarding authors for their creative labor and &#x93;promot[ing] &#x2026; Progress&#x94; are thus complementary; as James Madison observed, in copyright &#x93;[t]he public good fully coincides &#x2026; with the claims of individuals.&#x94;  The Federalist No. 43, p. 272 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).  Justice Breyer&#x92;s assertion that &#x93;copyright statutes must serve public, not private, ends&#x94; post, at 6, similarly misses the mark.  The two ends are not mutually exclusive; copyright law serves public ends by providing individuals with an incentive to pursue private ones.

						 As we have noted, see supra, at 5, n. 3, petitioners seek to distinguish the 1790 Act from those that followed.  They argue that by requiring authors seeking its protection to surrender whatever rights they had under state law, the 1790 Act enhanced uniformity and certainty and thus &#x93;promote[d] &#x2026; Progress.&#x94;  See Brief for Petitioners 28&#x96;31.  This account of the 1790 Act simply confirms, however, thatthe First Congress understood it could &#x93;promote &#x2026; Progress&#x94; by extending copyright protection to existing works.  Every subsequent adjustment of copyright&#x92;s duration, including the CTEA, reflects a similar understanding.

						 The fact that patent and copyright involve different exchanges does not, of course, mean that we may not be guided in our &#x93;limited Times&#x94; analysis by Congress&#x92; repeated extensions of existing patents.  See supra, at 10&#x96;13.  If patent&#x92;s quid pro quo is more exacting than copyright&#x92;s, then Congress&#x92; repeated extensions of existing patents without constitutional objection suggests even more strongly that similar legislation with respect to copyrights is constitutionally permissible.

						 Petitioners originally framed this argument as implicating the CTEA&#x92;s extension of both existing and future copyrights.  See Pet. for Cert. i.  Now, however, they train on the CTEA&#x92;s extension of existing copyrights and urge against consideration of the CTEA&#x92;s

See Brief for Petitioners 39&#x96;48; Reply Brief 16&#x96;17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11&#x96;13.  We therefore consider petitioners&#x92; argument as so limited.  We note, however, that petitioners do not explain how their

				This case concerns the authority the Constitution assigns to Congress to prescribe the duration of copyrights.  The Copyright and Patent Clause of the Constitution, Art. I, &#xA7;8, cl. 8, provides as to copyrights: &#x93;Congress shall have Power &#x2026; [t]o promote the Progress of Science &#x2026; by securing [to Authors] for limited Times &#x2026; the exclusive Right to their &#x2026; Writings.&#x94;  In 1998, in the measure here under inspection, Congress enlarged the duration of copyrights by 20 years.

				In accord with the District Court and the Court of Appeals, we reject petitioners&#x92; challenges to the CTEA.  In that 1998 legislation, as in all previous copyright term extensions, Congress placed existing and future copyrights in parity.  In prescribing that alignment, we hold, Congress acted within its authority and did not transgress constitutional limitations.

				We evaluate petitioners&#x92; challenge to the constitutionality of the CTEA against the backdrop of Congress&#x92; previous exercises of its authority under the Copyright Clause.  The Nation&#x92;s first copyright statute, enacted in 1790, provided a federal copyright term of 14 years from the date of publication, renewable for an additional 14 years if the author survived the first term.  Act of May 31, 1790, ch. 15, &#xA7;1, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.

				In 1976, Congress altered the method for computing federal copyright terms.  1976 Act &#xA7;&#xA7;302&#x96;304.  For works created by identified natural persons, the 1976 Act provided that federal copyright protection would run from the work&#x92;s creation, not&#x97;as in the 1790, 1831, and 1909 Acts&#x97;its publication; protection would last until 50 years after the author&#x92;s death.  &#xA7;302(a).  In these respects, the 1976 Act aligned United States copyright terms with the then-dominant international standard adopted under the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.  See H. R. Rep. No. 94&#x96;1476, p. 135 (1976).  For anonymous works, pseudonymous works, and works made for hire, the 1976 Act provided a term of 75 years from publication or 100 years from creation, whichever expired first.  &#xA7;302(c).

For published works with existing copyrights as of that date, the 1976 Act granted a copyright term of 75 years from the date of publication, &#xA7;304(a) and (b), a 19-year increase over the 56-year term applicable under the 1909 Act.

				  Petitioners contend, however, that existing copyrights extended to endure for that same term are not &#x93;limited.&#x94;  Petitioners&#x92; argument essentially reads into the text of the Copyright Clause the command that a time prescription, once set, becomes forever &#x93;fixed&#x94; or &#x93;inalterable.&#x94;  The word &#x93;limited,&#x94; however, does not convey a meaning so constricted.  At the time of the Framing, that word meant what it means today: &#x93;confine[d] within certain bounds,&#x94; &#x93;restrain[ed],&#x94; or &#x93;circumscribe[d].&#x94;  S.

				Congress&#x92; consistent historical practice of applying newly enacted copyright terms to future and existing copyrights reflects a judgment stated concisely by Representative Huntington at the time of the 1831 Act: &#x93;[J]ustice, policy, and equity alike forb[id]&#x94; that an &#x93;author who had sold his [work] a week ago, be placed in a worse situation than the author who should sell his work the day after the passing of [the] act.&#x94;  7 Cong.

J. 651, 694 (2000) (Prof. Miller) (&#x93;[S]ince 1790, it has indeed been Congress&#x92;s policy that the author of yesterday&#x92;s work should not get a lesser reward than the author of tomorrow&#x92;s work just because Congress passed a statute lengthening the term today.&#x94;).  The CTEA follows this historical practice by keeping the duration provisions of the 1976 Act largely in place and simply adding 20 years to each of them.  Guided by text, history, and precedent, we cannot agree with petitioners&#x92; submission that extending the duration of existing copyrights is categorically beyond Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright Clause.

				The CTEA reflects judgments of a kind Congress typically makes, judgments we cannot dismiss as outside the Legislature&#x92;s domain.  As respondent describes, see Brief for Respondent 37&#x96;38, a key factor in the CTEA&#x92;s passage was a 1993 European Union (EU) directive instructing EU members to establish a copyright term of life plus 70 years.  EU Council Directive 93/98, p. 4; see 144 Cong. Rec. S12377&#x96;S12378 (daily ed. Oct. 12, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch).  Consistent with the Berne Convention, the EU directed its members to deny this longer term to the works of any non-EU country whose laws did not secure the same extended term.  See Berne Conv. Art. 7(8); P. Goldstein, International Copyright &#xA7;5.3, p. 239 (2001).  By extending the baseline United States copyright term to life plus 70 years, Congress sought to ensure that American authors would receive the same copyright protection in Europe as their European counterparts.

				Closely related to petitioners&#x92; preambular argument, or a variant of it, is their assertion that the Copyright Clause &#x93;imbeds a quid pro quo.&#x94;  Brief for Petitioners 23.  They contend, in this regard, that Congress may grant to an &#x93;Autho[r]&#x94; an &#x93;exclusive Right&#x94; for a &#x93;limited Tim[e],&#x94; but only in exchange for a &#x93;Writin[g].&#x94;  Congress&#x92; power to confer copyright protection, petitioners argue, is thus contingent upon an exchange: The author of an original work receives an &#x93;exclusive Right&#x94; for a &#x93;limited Tim[e]&#x94; in exchange for a dedication to the public thereafter.  Extending an existing copyright without demanding additional consideration, petitioners maintain, bestows an unpaid-for benefit on copyright holders and their heirs, in violation of the 
				<em>
					quid pro quo
				</em>
				 requirement.

        <p class="bodytext">

 (&#x93;The economic philosophy behind the clause empowering Congress to grant patents and copyrights is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors in &#x91;Science and useful Arts.&#x92; &#x94;).  But the legislative evolution earlier recalled demonstrates what the bargain entails.  Given the consistent placement of existing copyright holders in parity with future holders, the author of a work created in the last 170 years would reasonably comprehend, as the &#x93;this&#x94; offered her, a copyright not only for the time in place when protection is gained, but also for any renewal or extension legislated during that time.

				  Congress could rationally seek to &#x93;promote &#x2026; Progress&#x94; by including in every copyright statute an express guarantee that authors would receive the benefit of any later legislative extension of the copyright term.

				  We reject petitioners&#x92; plea for imposition of uncommonly strict scrutiny on a copyright scheme that incorporates its own speech-protective purposes and safeguards.  The Copyright Clause and 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> were adopted close in time.  This proximity indicates that, in the Framers&#x92; view, copyright&#x92;s limited monopolies are compatible with free speech principles.  Indeed, copyright&#x92;s purpose is to 
				<em>
					promote
				</em>
				 the creation and publication of free expression.  As 
				<em>
					Harper &amp; Row
				</em>
				 observed: &#x93;[T]he Framers intended copyright itself to be the engine of free expression.  By establishing a marketable right to the use of one&#x92;s expression, copyright supplies the economic incentive to create and disseminate ideas.&#x94;  471 U. S., at 558.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In addition to spurring the creation and publication of new expression, copyright law contains built-in 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> accommodations.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 560.  First, it distinguishes between ideas and expression and makes only the latter eligible for copyright protection.  Specifically, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/102.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">17 U. S. C. &#xA7;102(b)</a> provides: &#x93;In no case does copyright protection for an original work of authorship extend to any idea, procedure, process, system, method of operation, concept, principle, or discovery, regardless of the form in which it is described, explained, illustrated, or embodied in such work.&#x94;  As we said in 
				<em>
					Harper &amp; Row
				</em>
				, this &#x93;idea/expression dichotomy strike[s] a definitional balance between the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> and the Copyright Act by permitting free communication of facts while still protecting an author&#x92;s expression.&#x94;  471 U.

Due to this distinction, every idea, theory, and fact in a copyrighted work becomes instantly available for public exploitation at the moment of publication.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 499 U. S., at 349&#x96;350.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the &#x93;fair use&#x94; defense allows the public to use not only facts and ideas contained in a copyrighted work, but also expression itself in certain circumstances.  Codified at 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/17/107.html" class="subref" title="subref">17 U. S.

				The CTEA itself supplements these traditional

				<em>
					Turner
				</em>
				 required cable operators to carry and transmit broadcast stations through their proprietary cable systems.  Those &#x93;must-carry&#x94; provisions, we explained, implicated &#x93;the heart of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>,&#x94; namely, &#x93;the principle that each person should decide for himself or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression, consideration, and adherence.&#x94;

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The CTEA, in contrast, does not oblige anyone to reproduce another&#x92;s speech against the carrier&#x92;s will.  Instead, it protects authors&#x92; original expression from unrestricted exploitation.  Protection of that order does not raise the free speech concerns present when the government compels or burdens the communication of particular facts or ideas.  The

				If petitioners&#x92; vision of the Copyright Clause held sway, it would do more than render the CTEA&#x92;s duration extensions unconstitutional as to existing works.  Indeed, petitioners&#x92; assertion that the provisions of the CTEA are not severable would make the CTEA&#x92;s enlarged terms invalid even as to tomorrow&#x92;s work.  The 1976 Act&#x92;s time extensions, which set the pattern that the CTEA followed, would be vulnerable as well.

Beneath the facade of their inventive constitutional interpretation, petitioners forcefully urge that Congress pursued very bad policy in prescribing the CTEA&#x92;s long terms.  The wisdom of Congress&#x92; action, however, is not within our province to second guess.  Satisfied that the legislation before us remains inside the domain the Constitution assigns to the First Branch, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.

						 Justice Breyer&#x92;s dissent is not similarly restrained.  He makes no effort meaningfully to distinguish existing copyrights from future grants.  See, e.g., post, at 1, 13&#x96;19, 23&#x96;25.  Under his reasoning, the CTEA&#x92;s 20-year extension is globally unconstitutional.

						 Asserting that the last several decades have seen a proliferation of copyright legislation in departure from Congress&#x92; traditional pace of legislative amendment in this area, petitioners cite nine statutes passed between 1962 and 1974, each of which incrementally extended existing copyrights for brief periods.

						 Petitioners argue that the 1790 Act must be distinguished from the later Acts on the ground that it covered existing works but did not extend existing copyrights.  Reply Brief 3&#x96;7.  The parties disagree on the question whether the 1790 Act&#x92;s copyright term should be regarded in part as compensation for the loss of any then existing state- or common-law copyright protections.  See Brief for Petitioners 28&#x96;30; Brief for Respondent 17, n. 9; Reply Brief 3&#x96;7.  Without resolving that dispute, we underscore that the First Congress clearly did confer copyright protection on works that had already been created.

						 We note again that Justice Breyer makes no such concession.  See supra, at 2, n. 1.  He does not train his fire, as petitioners do, on Congress&#x92; choice to place existing and future copyrights in parity.  Moving beyond the bounds of the parties&#x92; presentations, and with abundant policy arguments but precious little support from precedent, he would condemn Congress&#x92; entire product as irrational.

						 This approach comported with English practice at the time.  The Statute of Anne, 1710, 8 Ann. c. 19, provided copyright protection to books not yet composed or published, books already composed but not yet published, and books already composed and published.  See ibid. (&#x93;[T]he author of any book or books already composed, and not printed and published, or that shall hereafter be composed, and his assignee or assigns, shall have the sole liberty of printing and reprinting such book and books for the term of fourteen years, to commence from the day of the first publishing the same, and no longer.&#x94;); ibid.  (&#x93;[T]he author of any book or books already printed &#x2026; or the bookseller or booksellers, printer or printers, or other person or persons, who hath or have purchased or acquired the copy or copies of any book or books, in order to print or reprint the same, shall have the sole right and liberty of printing such book and books for the term of one and twenty years, to commence from the said tenth day of April, and no longer.&#x94;).


Justice Stevens stresses the rejection of a proposed amendment to the Statute of Anne that would have extended the term of existing copyrights, and reports that opponents of the extension feared it would perpetuate the monopoly position enjoyed by English booksellers.  Post, at 12, and n. 9.  But the English Parliament confronted a situation that never existed in the United States.  Through the late 17th century, a government-sanctioned printing monopoly was held by the Stationers&#x92; Company, &#x93;the ancient London guild of printers and booksellers.&#x94;  M. Rose, Authors and Owners: The Invention of Copyright 4 (1993); see L. Patterson, Copyright in Historical Perspective ch. 3 (1968).  Although that legal monopoly ended in 1695, concerns about monopolistic practices remained, and the 18th century English Parliament was resistant to any enhancement of booksellers&#x92; and publishers&#x92; entrenched position.  See Rose, supra, at 52&#x96;56.  In this country, in contrast, competition among publishers, printers, and booksellers was &#x93;intens[e]&#x94; at the time of the founding, and &#x93;there was not even a rough analog to the Stationers&#x92; Company on the horizon.&#x94;  Nachbar, Constructing Copyright&#x92;s Mythology, 6 Green Bag 2d 37, 45 (2002).  The Framers guarded against the future accumulation of monopoly power in booksellers and publishers by authorizing Congress to vest copyrights only in &#x93;Authors.&#x94;  Justice Stevens does not even attempt to explain how Parliament&#x92;s response to England&#x92;s experience with a publishing monopoly may be construed to impose a constitutional limitation on Congress&#x92; power to extend copyrights granted to &#x93;Authors.&#x94;

						 Moreover, the precise duration of a federal copyright has never been fixed at the time of the initial grant.  The 1790 Act provided a federal copyright term of 14 years from the work&#x92;s publication, renewable for an additional 14 years if the author survived and applied for an additional term.  &#xA7;1.  Congress retained that approach in subsequent statutes.  See Stewart v. Abend, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/495/207" class="subref" title="subref">495 U. S. 207</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">217</a> (1990)
 (&#x93;Since the earliest copyright statute in this country, the copyright term of ownership has been split between an original term and a renewal term.&#x94;).  Similarly, under the method for measuring copyright terms established by the 1976 Act and retained by the CTEA, the baseline copyright term is measured in part by the life of the author, rendering its duration indeterminate at the time of the grant.  See 1976 Act &#xA7;302(a);

						 Justice Stevens would sweep away these decisions, asserting that Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/1" class="subref" title="subref">383 U. S. 1</a> (1966)
, &#x93;flatly contradicts&#x94; them.  Post, at 17.  Nothing but wishful thinking underpins that assertion.  The controversy in Graham involved no patent extension.  Graham addressed an invention&#x92;s very eligibility for patent protection, and spent no words on Congress&#x92; power to enlarge a patent&#x92;s duration.

						 Justice Stevens recites words from Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Stiffel Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/376/225" class="subref" title="subref">376 U. S. 225</a> (1964)
, supporting the uncontroversial proposition that a State may not &#x93;extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date,&#x94; id., at 231, then boldly asserts that for the same reasons Congress may not do so either.  See post, at 1, 5.  But Sears placed no reins on Congress&#x92; authority to extend a patent&#x92;s life.  The full sentence in Sears, from which Justice Stevens extracts words, reads: &#x93;Obviously a State could not, consistently with the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution, extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date or give a patent on an article which lacked the level of invention required for federal patents.&#x94;  376 U. S., at 231.  The point insistently made in Sears is no more and no less than this: States may not enact measures inconsistent with the federal patent laws.  Ibid. (&#x93;[A] State cannot encroach upon the federal patent laws directly &#x2026; [and] cannot &#x2026; give protection of a kind that clashes with the objectives of the federal patent laws.&#x94;).  A decision thus rooted in the Supremacy Clause cannot be turned around to shrink congressional choices.


Also unavailing is Justice Stevens&#x92; appeal to language found in a private letter written by James Madison.  Post, at 9, n. 6; see also dissenting opinion of Breyer, J., post, at 5, 20.  Respondent points to a better &#x93;demonstrat[ion],&#x94; post, at 5, n. 3 (Stevens, J., dissenting), of Madison&#x92;s and other Framers&#x92; understanding of the scope of Congress&#x92; power to extend patents: &#x93;[T]hen-President Thomas Jefferson&#x97;the first administrator of the patent system, and perhaps the Founder with the narrowest view of the copyright and patent powers&#x97;signed the 1808 and 1809 patent term extensions into law; &#x2026; James Madison, who drafted the Constitution&#x92;s &#x91;limited Times&#x92; language, issued the extended patents under those laws as Secretary of State; and &#x2026; Madison as President signed another patent term extension in 1815.&#x94;  Brief for Respondent 15.

						 Justice Stevens reads McClurg to convey that &#x93;Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee.&#x94; Post, at 19.  But McClurg concerned no such change.  To the contrary, as Justice Stevens acknowledges, McClurg held that use of an invention by the patentee&#x92;s employer did not invalidate the inventor&#x92;s 1834 patent, &#x93;even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.&#x94;  Post, at 18.  In other words, McClurg evaluated the patentee&#x92;s rights not simply in light of the patent law in force at the time the patent issued, but also in light of &#x93;such changes as ha[d] been since made.&#x94;  1 How., at 206.  It is thus inescapably plain that McClurg upheld the application of expanded patent protection to an existing patent.

						 Justice Breyer would adopt a heightened, three-part test for the constitutionality of copyright enactments.  Post, at 3.  He would invalidate the CTEA as irrational in part because, in his view, harmonizing the United States and European Union baseline copyright terms &#x93;apparent[ly]&#x94; fails to achieve &#x93;significant&#x94; uniformity.  Post, at 23.  But see infra, at 15.  The novelty of the &#x93;rational basis&#x94; approach he presents is plain.  Cf. Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett,

 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (&#x93;Rational-basis review&#x97;with its presumptions favoring constitutionality&#x97;is &#x91;a paradigm of judicial restraint.&#x92; &#x94;) (quoting FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc.,

).  Rather than subjecting Congress&#x92; legislative choices in the copyright area to heightened judicial scrutiny, we have stressed that &#x93;it is not our role to alter the delicate balance Congress has labored to achieve.&#x94;  Stewart v. Abend, 495 U. S., at 230; see Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,

						 Members of Congress expressed the view that, as a result of increases in human longevity and in parents&#x92; average age when their children are born, the pre-CTEA term did not adequately secure &#x93;the right to profit from licensing one&#x92;s work during one&#x92;s lifetime andto take pride and comfort in knowing that one&#x92;s children&#x97;and per-haps their children&#x97;might also benefit from one&#x92;s posthumous popularity.&#x94;  141 Cong. Rec. 6553 (1995) (statement of Sen. Feinstein); see 144 Cong. Rec. S12377 (daily ed. Oct. 12, 1998) (statement of Sen. Hatch) (&#x93;Among the main developments [compelling reconsideration of the 1976 Act&#x92;s term] is the effect of demographic trends, such as increasing longevity and the trend toward rearing children later in life, on the effectiveness of the life-plus-50 term to provide adequate protection for American creators and their heirs.&#x94;).

						 Justice Breyer urges that the economic incentives accompanying copyright term extension are too insignificant to &#x93;mov[e]&#x94; any author with a &#x93;rational economic perspective.&#x94;  Post, at 14; see post, at 13&#x96;16.  Calibrating rational economic incentives, however, like &#x93;fashion[ing] &#x2026; new rules [in light of] new technology,&#x94; Sony, 464 U. S., at 431, is a task primarily for Congress, not the courts.  Congress heard testimony from a number of prominent artists; each expressed the belief that the copyright system&#x92;s assurance of fair compensation for themselves and their heirs was an incentive to create.  See, e.g., House Hearings 233&#x96;239 (statement of Quincy Jones); Copyright Term Extension Act of 1995: Hearings before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 104th Cong., 1st Sess., 55&#x96;56 (1995) (statement of Bob Dylan); id., at 56&#x96;57 (statement of Don Henley); id., at 57 (statement of Carlos Santana).  We would not take Congress to task for crediting this evidence which, as Justice Breyer acknowledges, reflects general &#x93;propositions about the value of incentives&#x94; that are &#x93;undeniably true.&#x94;  Post, at 14. 


Congress also heard testimony from Register of Copyrights Marybeth Peters and others regarding the economic incentives created by the CTEA.  According to the Register, extending the copyright for existing works &#x93;could &#x2026; provide additional income that would finance the production and distribution of new works.&#x94;  House Hearings 158.  &#x93;Authors would not be able to continue to create,&#x94; the Register explained, &#x93;unless they earned income on their finished works.  The public benefits not only from an author&#x92;s original work but also from his or her further creations.  Although this truism may be illustrated in many ways, one of the best examples is Noah Webster[,] who supported his entire family from the earnings on his speller and grammar during the twenty years he took to complete his dictionary.&#x94;  Id., at 165.

						 Justice Breyer agrees that &#x93;Congress did not intend to act unconstitutionally&#x94; when it enacted the CTEA, post, at 15, yet in his very next breath, he seems to make just that accusation, ibid.  What else is one to glean from his selection of scattered statements from individual members of Congress?  He does not identify any statement in the statutory text that installs a perpetual copyright, for there is none.  But even if the statutory text were sufficiently ambiguous to warrant recourse to legislative history, Justice Breyer&#x92;s selections are not the sort to which this Court accords high value: &#x93;In surveying legislative history we have repeatedly stated that the authoritative source for finding the Legislature&#x92;s intent lies in the Committee Reports on the bill, which &#x91;represen[t] the considered and collective understanding of those [members of Congress] involved in drafting and studying proposed legislation.&#x92; &#x94;  Garcia v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/469/70" class="subref" title="subref">469 U. S. 70</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">76</a> (1984)
 (quoting Zuber v. Allen, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/396/168" class="subref" title="subref">396 U. S. 168</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">186</a> (1969)
).  The House and Senate Reports accompanying the CTEA reflect no purpose to make copyright a forever thing.  Notably, the Senate Report expressly acknowledged that the Constitution &#x93;clearly precludes Congress from granting unlimited protection for copyrighted works,&#x94; S. Rep. No. 104&#x96;315, p. 11 (1996), and disclaimed any intent to contravene that prohibition, ibid.  Members of Congress instrumental in the CTEA&#x92;s passage spoke to similar effect.  See, e.g., 144 Cong. Rec. H1458 (daily ed. Mar. 25, 1998) (statement of Rep. Coble) (observing that &#x93;copyright protection should be for a limited time only&#x94; and that &#x93;[p]erpetual protection does not benefit society&#x94;).   


Justice Breyer nevertheless insists that the &#x93;economic effect&#x94; of the CTEA is to make the copyright term &#x93;virtually perpetual.&#x94;  Post, at 1.  Relying on formulas and assumptions provided in an amicus brief supporting petitioners, he stresses that the CTEA creates a copyright term worth 99.8% of the value of a perpetual copyright.  Post, at 13&#x96;15.  If Justice Breyer&#x92;s calculations were a basis for holding the CTEA unconstitutional, then the 1976 Act would surely fall as well, for&#x97;under the same assumptions he indulges&#x97;the term set by that Act secures 99.4% of the value of a perpetual term.  See Brief for George A. Akerloff et al. as Amici Curiae 6, n. 6 (describing the relevant formula).  Indeed, on that analysis even the &#x93;limited&#x94; character of the 1909 (97.7%) and 1831 (94.1%) Acts might be suspect.  Justice Breyer several times places the Founding Fathers on his side.  See, e.g., post, at 5, 20.  It is doubtful, however, that those architects of our Nation, in framing the &#x93;limited Times&#x94; prescription, thought in terms of the calculator rather than the calendar.

						 Respondent notes that the CTEA&#x92;s life-plus-70-years baseline term is expected to produce an average copyright duration of 95 years, and that this term &#x93;resembles some other long-accepted durational practices in the law, such as 99-year leases of real property and bequests within the rule against perpetuities.&#x94;  Brief for Respondent 27, n. 18.  Whether such referents mark the outer boundary of &#x93;limited Times&#x94; is not before us today.  Justice Breyer suggests that the CTEA&#x92;s baseline term extends beyond that typically permitted by the traditional rule against perpetuities.  Post, at 15&#x96;16.  The traditional common-law rule looks to lives in being plus 21 years.  Under that rule, the period before a bequest vests could easily equal or exceed the anticipated average copyright term under the CTEA.  If, for example, the vesting period on a deed were defined with reference to the life of an infant, the sum of the measuring life plus 21 years could commonly add up to 95 years.

						 Justice Stevens&#x92; characterization of reward to the author as &#x93;a secondary consideration&#x94; of copyright law, post, at 6, n. 4 (internal quotation marks omitted), understates the relationship between such rewards and the &#x93;Progress of Science.&#x94;  As we have explained, &#x93;[t]he economic philosophy behind the [Copyright] [C]lause &#x2026; is the conviction that encouragement of individual effort by personal gain is the best way to advance public welfare through the talents of authors and inventors.&#x94;  Mazer v. Stein,

.  Accordingly, &#x93;copyright law celebrates the profit motive, recognizing that the incentive to profit from the exploitation of copyrights will redound to the public benefit by resulting in the proliferation of knowledge&#x2026; .  The profit motive is the engine that ensures the progress of science.&#x94;  American Geophysical Union v. Texaco Inc., 802 F. Supp. 1, 27 (SDNY 1992), aff&#x92;d, 60 F. 3d 913 (CA2 1994).  Rewarding authors for their creative labor and &#x93;promot[ing] &#x2026; Progress&#x94; are thus complementary; as James Madison observed, in copyright &#x93;[t]he public good fully coincides &#x2026; with the claims of individuals.&#x94;  The Federalist No. 43, p. 272 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).  Justice Breyer&#x92;s assertion that &#x93;copyright statutes must serve public, not private, ends&#x94; post, at 6, similarly misses the mark.  The two ends are not mutually exclusive; copyright law serves public ends by providing individuals with an incentive to pursue private ones.

						 As we have noted, see supra, at 5, n. 3, petitioners seek to distinguish the 1790 Act from those that followed.

This account of the 1790 Act simply confirms, however, thatthe First Congress understood it could &#x93;promote &#x2026; Progress&#x94; by extending copyright protection to existing works.  Every subsequent adjustment of copyright&#x92;s duration, including the CTEA, reflects a similar understanding.

				  As I shall explain, the reasons why a State may not extend the life of a patent apply to Congress as well.  If Congress may not expand the scope of a patent monopoly, it also may not extend the life of a copyright beyond its expiration date.  Accordingly, insofar as the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.
2827, purported to extend the life of unexpired copyrights, it is invalid.  Because the majority&#x92;s contrary conclusion rests on the mistaken premise that this Court has virtually no role in reviewing congressional grants of monopoly privileges to authors, inventors and their successors, I respectfully dissent.

If an inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention; if he should for a long period of years retain the monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure; and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to secure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under it during his fourteen years; it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful arts, and give a premium to those, who should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries.&#x94;

 (&#x93;[T]he patent system represents a carefully crafted bargain that encourages both the creation and the public disclosure of new and useful advances in technology, in return for an exclusive monopoly for a limited period of time&#x94;).  It would be manifestly unfair if, after issuing a patent, the Government as a representative of the public sought to modify the bargain by shortening the term of the patent in order to accelerate public access to the invention.  The fairness considerations that underlie the constitutional protections against 
				<em>
					ex post facto
				</em>
				 laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts would presumably disable Congress from making such a retroactive change in the public&#x92;s bargain with an inventor without providing compensation for the taking.  Those same considerations should protect members of the public who make plans to exploit an invention as soon as it enters the public domain from a retroactive modification of the bargain that extends the term of the patent monopoly.  As I discuss below, the few historical exceptions to this rule do not undermine the constitutional analysis.  For quite plainly, the limitations &#x93;implicit in the Patent Clause itself,&#x94; 489 U. S., at 151, adequately explain why neither a State nor Congress may &#x93;extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date,&#x94;

				 extensions of copyrights result in a gratuitous transfer of wealth from the public to authors, publishers, and their successors in interest.  Such retroactive extensions do not even arguably serve either of the purposes of the Copyright/Patent Clause.  The reasons why such extensions of the patent monopoly are unconstitutional apply to copyrights as well.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent, however, advances four arguments in support of the constitutionality of such retroactive extensions: (1) the first Copyright Act enacted shortly after the Constitution was ratified applied to works that had already been produced; (2) later Congresses have repeatedly authorized extensions of copyrights and patents; (3) such extensions promote the useful arts by giving copyright holders an incentive to preserve and restore certain valuable motion pictures; and (4) as a matter of equity, whenever Congress provides a longer term as an incentive to the creation of new works by authors, it should provide an equivalent reward to the owners of all unexpired copyrights.  None of these arguments is persuasive.

				What eventually became the Patent Act of 1790 had its genesis in House Resolution 41, introduced on February 16, 1790.  That resolution differed from H. R. 10 in one important respect.  Whereas H. R. 10 would have extended patent protection to only those inventions that were &#x93;not before known or used,&#x94; H. R. 41, by contrast, added the phrase &#x93;within the United States&#x94; to that limitation and expressly authorized patent protection for &#x93;any person, who shall after the passing of this act, first import into the United States . . . any . . . device . . . not before used or known in the said States.&#x94;  6 Documentary History,

				, at 1626&#x96;1632.  This change would have authorized patents of importation, providing United States patent protection for inventions already in use elsewhere.  This change, however, was short lived and was removed by a floor amendment on March 5, 1789.  Walterscheid 125.  Though exact records of the floor debate are lost, correspondence from House members indicate that doubts about the constitutionality of such a provision led to its removal.  Representative Thomas Fitzsimmons wrote to a leading industrialist that day stating that the section &#x93;&#x91;allowing to Importers, was left out, the Constitutional power being Questionable.&#x92; &#x94;

				, at 126 (quoting Letter from Rep. Thomas Fitzsimmons to Tench Coxe (March 5, 1790)).  James Madison himself recognized this constitutional limitation on patents of importation, flatly stating that the constitution &#x93;forbids patents for that purpose.&#x94;  13 Papers of James Madison 128 (C.

				The final version of the 1790 Patent Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
109, did not contain the geographic qualifier and thus did not provide for patents of importation.  This statutory omission, coupled with the contemporaneous statements by legislators, provides strong evidence that Congress recognized significant limitations on their constitutional authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause to extend protection to a class of intellectual properties.  This recognition of a categorical constitutional limitation is fundamentally at odds with the majority&#x92;s reading of Article I, &#xA7;8 to provide essentially no limit on congressional action under the Clause.  If early congressional practice does, indeed, inform our analysis, as it should, then the majority&#x92;s judicial excision of these constitutional limits cannot be correct.

The Copyright Act

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				Congress also passed the first Copyright Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124, in 1790.  At that time there were a number of maps, charts, and books that had already been printed, some of which were copyrighted under state laws and some of which were arguably entitled to perpetual protection under the common law.  The federal statute applied to those works as well as to new works.  In some cases the application of the new federal rule reduced the pre-existing protections, and in others it may have increased the protection.  What is significant is that the statute provided a general rule creating new federal rights that supplanted the diverse state rights that previously existed.  It did not extend or attach to any of those pre-existing state and common-law rights: &#x93;That congress, in passing the act of 1790, did not legislate in reference to existing rights, appears clear.&#x94;  Wheaton

 (&#x93;As this Court has repeatedly said, the Congress did not sanction an existing right but created a new one&#x94;).  Congress set in place a federal structure governing certain types of intellectual property for the new Republic.  That Congress exercised its unquestionable constitutional authority to

				  Precisely put, the question presented by this case does not even implicate the 1790 Act, for that Act created, rather than extended, copyright protection.  That this law applied to works already in existence says nothing about the First Congress&#x92; conception of their power to extend this newly created federal right.

				Moreover, members of Congress in 1790 were well aware of the distinction between the creation of new copyright regimes and the extension of existing copyrights.  The 1790 Act was patterned, in many ways, after the Statute of Anne enacted in England in 1710.  8 Ann., c. 19; see

.  The English statute, in addition to providing authors with copyrights on new works for a term of 14 years renewable for another 14-year term, also replaced the booksellers&#x92; claimed perpetual rights in existing works with a single 21-year term.  In 1735, the booksellers proposed an amendment that would have extended the terms of existing copyrights until 1756, but the amendment was defeated.  Opponents of the amendment had argued that if the bill were to pass, it would &#x93;in Effect be establishing a perpetual Monopoly &#x2026; only to increase the private Gain of the Booksellers &#x2026; .&#x94;

				  The authors of the federal statute that used the Statute of Anne as a model were familiar with this history.  Accordingly, this Court should be especially wary of relying on Congress&#x92; creation of a new system to support the proposition that Congress unquestionably understood that it had constitutional authority to extend existing copyrights.

				Since the creation of federal patent and copyright protection in 1790, Congress has passed a variety of legislation, both providing specific relief for individual authors and inventors as well as changing the general statutes conferring patent and copyright privileges.  Some of the changes did indeed, as the majority describes, extend existing protections retroactively.  Other changes, however, did not do so.  A more complete and comprehensive look at the history of congressional action under the

				Congress, aside from changing the process of applying for a patent in the 1793 Patent Act, did not significantly alter the basic patent and copyright systems for the next 40 years.  During this time, however, Congress did consider many private bills.  Respondent seeks support from &#x93;Congress&#x92;s historical practice of using its Copyright and Patent Clause authority to extend the terms of individual patents and copyrights.&#x94;  Brief for Respondent 13.

				The first example relied upon by respondent, the extension of Oliver Evans&#x92; patent in 1808, ch. 8, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70, demonstrates the pitfalls of relying on an incomplete historical analysis.  Evans, an inventor who had developed several improvements in milling flour, received the third federal patent on January 7, 1791.  See Federico, Patent Trials of Oliver Evans, 27 J. Pat. Off. Soc. 586, 590 (1945).  Under the 14-year term provided by the 1790 Patent Act, this patent was to expire on January 7, 1805.  Claiming that 14 years had not provided him a sufficient time to realize income from his invention and that the net profits were spent developing improvements on the steam engine, Evans first sought an extension of his patent in December 1804.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 598; 14 Annals of Congress 1002.  Unsuccessful in 1804, he tried again in 1805, and yet again in 1806, to persuade Congress to pass his private bill.  Undaunted, Evans tried one last time to revive his expired patent after receiving an adverse judgment in an infringement action.  See 
				<em>
					Evans 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 8 F. Cas. 837 (No. 4,555) (CC Pa. 1807).  This time, his effort at private legislation was successful and Congress passed a bill extending his patent for 14 years.  See An Act for the relief of Oliver Evans, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70.  This legislation, passed January 21, 1808, restored a patent monopoly for an invention that had been in the public domain for over four years.  As such, this Act unquestionably exceeded Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause: &#x93;The Congress in the exercise of the patent power may not overreach the restraints imposed by the stated constitutional purpose. &#x2026;  
				<em>
					Congress may not authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain, or to restrict free access to materials already available.

				This extension of patent protection to an expired patent was not an isolated incident.  Congress passed private bills either directly extending patents or allowing otherwise untimely applicants to apply for patent extensions for approximately 75 patents between 1790 and 1875.  Of these 75 patents, at least 56 had already fallen into the public domain.

				Copyright legislation has a similar history.  The federal Copyright Act was first amended in 1831. That amendment, like later amendments, not only authorized a longer term for new works, but also extended the terms of unexpired copyrights.  Respondent argues that that historical practice effectively establishes the constitutionality of retroactive extensions of unexpired copyrights.  Of course, the practice buttressess the presumption of validity that attaches to every Act of Congress.  But, as our decision in

, demonstrates, the fact that Congress has repeatedly acted on a mistaken interpretation of the Constitution does not qualify our duty to invalidate an unconstitutional practice when it is finally challenged in an appropriate case.  As Justice White pointed out in his dissent in 
				<em>
					Chadha
				</em>
				, that case sounded the &#x93;death knell for nearly 200 other statutory provisions&#x94; in which Congress had exercised a &#x93;legislative veto.&#x94;

				It would be particularly unwise to attach constitutional significance to the 1831 amendment because of the very different legal landscape against which it was enacted.  Congress based its authority to pass the amendment on grounds shortly thereafter declared improper by the Court.  The Judiciary Committee Report prepared for the House of Representatives asserted that &#x93;an author has an exclusive and perpetual right, in preference to any other, to the fruits of his labor.&#x94;  7 Gales &amp; Seaton, Register of Debates in Congress cxx (1831).  The floor debate echoed this same sentiment.  See,

				 8 Pet., at 661 (&#x93;Congress, then, by this act, instead of sanctioning an existing right, as contended for, created it&#x94;).

				In 1861, Congress amended the term of patents, from a 14-year term plus opportunity for 7-year extension to a flat 17 years with no extension permitted.  Act of Mar. 2, 1861, ch. 88, &#xA7;16,

				  To be sure, Congress, at many times in its history, has retroactively extended the terms of existing copyrights and patents.  This history, however, reveals a much more heterogeneous practice than respondent contends.  It is replete with actions that were unquestionably unconstitutional.  Though relevant, the history is not dispositive of the constitutionality of Sonny Bono Act.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The general presumption that historic practice illuminates the constitutionality of congressional action is not controlling in this case.  That presumption is strongest when the earliest acts of Congress are considered, for the overlap of identity between those who created the Constitution and those who first constituted Congress provides &#x93;contemporaneous and weighty evidence&#x94; of the Constitution&#x92;s &#x93;true meaning.&#x94;

				The majority&#x92;s reliance on the other patent case it cites is similarly misplaced.  Contrary to the suggestion in the Court&#x92;s opinion, 
				<em>
					McClurg 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Kingsland,

				, at 10&#x96;11. The question in that case was whether the former employer of the inventor, one James Harley, could be held liable as an infringer for continuing to use the process that Harley had invented in 1834 when he was in its employ.  The Court first held that the employer&#x92;s use of the process before the patent issued was not a public use that would invalidate the patent, even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.  1 How., at 206&#x96;208.  The Court then disposed of the case on the ground that a statute enacted in 1839 protected the alleged infringer&#x92;s right to continue to use the process after the patent issued.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 209&#x96;211.  Our opinion said nothing about the power of Congress to extend the life of an issued patent.  It did note that Congress has plenary power to legislate on the subject of patents provided &#x93;that they do not take away the rights of property in existing patents.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 206.  The fact that Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee is, of course, fully consistent with the view that it cannot enlarge the patent monopoly to the detriment of the public after a patent has issued.

				The history of retroactive extensions of existing and expired copyrights and patents, though relevant, is not conclusive of the constitutionality of the Sonny Bono Act.

				Respondent also argues that the Act promotes the useful arts by providing incentives to restore old movies.  For at least three reasons, the interest in preserving perishable copies of old copyrighted films does not justify a wholesale extension of existing copyrights.  First, such restoration and preservation will not even arguably promote any new works by authors or inventors.  And, of course, any original expression in the restoration and preservation of movies will receive new copyright protection.

            </a>
				  Second, however strong the justification for preserving such works may be, that justification applies equally to works whose copyrights have already expired.  Yet no one seriously contends that the Copyright/Patent Clause would authorize the grant of monopoly privileges for works already in the public domain solely to encourage their restoration.  Finally, even if this concern with aging movies would permit congressional protection, the remedy offered&#x97;a blanket extension of all copyrights&#x97;simply bears no relationship to the alleged harm.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Finally, respondent relies on concerns of equity to justify the retroactive extension.  If Congress concludes that a longer period of exclusivity is necessary in order to provide an adequate incentive to authors to produce new works, respondent seems to believe that simple fairness requires that the same lengthened period be provided to authors whose works have already been completed and copyrighted.  This is a classic non sequitur.  The reason for increasing the inducement to create something new simply does not apply to an already-created work.  To the contrary, the equity argument actually provides strong support for petitioners.  Members of the public were entitled to rely on a promised access to copyrighted or patented works at the expiration of the terms specified when the exclusive privileges were granted.  On the other hand, authors will receive the full benefit of the exclusive terms that were promised as an inducement to their creativity, and have no equitable claim to increased compensation for doing nothing more.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				One must indulge in two untenable assumptions to find support in the equitable argument offered by respondent&#x97;that the public interest in free access to copyrighted works is entirely worthless and that authors, as a class, should receive a windfall solely based on completed creative activity.  Indeed, Congress has apparently indulged in those assumptions for under the series of extensions to copyrights, only one year&#x92;s worth of creative work&#x97;that copyrighted in 1923&#x97;has fallen into the public domain during the last 80 years.  But as our cases repeatedly and consistently emphasize, ultimate public access is the overriding purpose of the constitutional provision.  See,

				The express grant of a perpetual copyright would unquestionably violate the textual requirement that the authors&#x92; exclusive rights be only &#x93;for limited Times.&#x94;  Whether the extraordinary length of the grants authorized by the 1998 Act are invalid because they are the functional equivalent of perpetual copyrights is a question that need not be answered in this case because the question presented by the certiorari petition merely challenges Congress&#x92; power to extend retroactively the terms of existing copyrights.  Accordingly, there is no need to determine whether the deference that is normally given to congressional policy judgments may save from judicial review its decision respecting the appropriate length of the term.

				  It is important to note, however, that a categorical rule prohibiting retroactive extensions would effectively preclude perpetual copyrights.  More importantly, as the House of Lords recognized when it refused to amend the Statute of Anne in 1735, unless the Clause is construed to embody such a categorical rule, Congress may extend existing monopoly privileges

				By failing to protect the public interest in free access to the products of inventive and artistic genius&#x97;indeed, by virtually ignoring the central purpose of the Copyright/Patent Clause&#x97;the Court has quitclaimed to Congress its principal responsibility in this area of the law.  Fairly read, the Court has stated that Congress&#x92; actions under the Copyright/Patent Clause are, for all intents and purposes, judicially unreviewable.  That result cannot be squared with the basic tenets of our constitutional structure.  It is not hyperbole to recall the trenchant words of Chief Justice John Marshall: &#x93;It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.&#x94;

						 Justice Harlan wrote a brief concurrence, but did not disagree with this statement.  Justice Black&#x92;s statement echoed a portion of Attorney General Wirt&#x92;s argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 171 (1824): &#x93;The law of Congress declares, that all inventors of useful improvements throughout the United States, shall be entitled to the exclusive right in their discoveries for fourteen years only.  The law of New-York declares, that this inventor shall be entitled to the exclusive use of his discovery for thirty years, and as much longer as the State shall permit.  The law of Congress, by limiting the exclusive right to fourteen years, in effect declares, that after the expiration of that time, the discovery shall be the common right of the whole people of the United States.&#x94;

						Attorney General Wirt made this precise point in his argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 175: &#x93;The limitation is not for the advantage of the inventor, but of society at large, which is to take the benefit of the invention after the period of limitation has expired.  The patentee pays a duty on his patent, which is an effective source of revenue to the United States.  It is virtually a contract between each patentee and the people of the United States, by which the time of exclusive and secure enjoyment is limited, and then the benefit of the discovery results to the public.&#x94;

						The Court acknowledges that this proposition is &#x93;uncontroversial&#x94; today, see ante, at 11, n. 6, but overlooks the fact that it was highly controversial in the early 1800&#x92;s.  See n. 11, infra.  The Court assumes that the Sears holding rested entirely on the pre-emptive effect of congressional statutes even though the opinion itself, like the opinions  in Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City,

, also relied on the pre-emptive effect of the constitutional provision.  That at least some of the Framers recognized that the Constitution itself imposed a limitation even before Congress acted is demonstrated by Madison&#x92;s letter, quoted in n. 6, infra.

						 &#x93;Your idea of appropriating a district of territory to the encouragement of imported inventions is new and worthy of consideration.  I can not but apprehend however that the clause in the constitution which forbids patents for that purpose will lie equally in the way of your expedient.  Congress seem to be tied down to the single mode of encouraging inventions by granting the exclusive benefit of them for a limited time, and therefore to have no more power to give a further encouragement out of a fund of land than a fund of money.  This fetter on the National Legislature tho&#x92; an unfortunate one, was a deliberate one.  The Latitude of authority now wished for was strongly urged and expressly rejected.&#x94;  Madison&#x92;s description of the Copyright/Patent Clause as a &#x93;fetter on the National Legislature&#x94; is fully consistent with this Court&#x92;s opinion in Graham.

						 Importantly, even this first Act required a quid pro quo in order to receive federal copyright protection.  In order to receive protection under the Act, the author was first required to register the work: &#x93;That no person shall be entitled to the benefit of this act, in cases where any map, chart, book or books, hath or have been already printed and published, unless he shall first deposit, and in all other cases, unless he shall before publication deposit a printed copy of the title of such map, chart, book or books, in the clerk&#x92;s office of the district court where the author or proprietor shall reside.&#x94; &#xA7;3, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124.  This registration requirement in federal district court&#x97;a requirement obviously not required under the various state laws protecting written works&#x97;further illustrates that the 1790 Act created new rights, rather than extending existing rights.

						 Respondent&#x92;s reformulation of the questions presented by this case confuses this basic distinction.  We granted certiorari to consider the question: &#x93;Did the D. C. Circuit err in holding that Congress has the power under the Copyright Clause to extend retroactively the term of existing copyrights?&#x94;  Respondent&#x92;s reformulation of the first question presented&#x97;&#x93;Whether the 20-year extension of the terms of all unexpired copyrights . . . violates the Copyright Clause of the Constitution insofar as it applies to works in existence when it took effect&#x94;&#x97;significantly changes the substance of inquiry by changing the focus from the federal statute at issue to irrelevant common-law protections.  Brief for Respondent I.  Indeed, this reformulation violated this Court&#x92;s Rule 24(1)(a), which states that &#x93;the brief [on the merits] may not raise additional questions or change the substance of the questions already presented in&#x94; the petition for certiorari.

						 In the period before our decision in Wheaton, the pre-emptive effect of the Patent/Copyright Clause was also a matter of serious debate within the legal profession. Indeed, in their argument in this Court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 44&#x96;61, 141&#x96;157, the defenders of New York&#x92;s grant of a 30-year monopoly on the passenger trade between New Jersey and Manhattan argued that the Clause actually should be interpreted as confirming the State&#x92;s authority to grant monopoly privileges that supplemented any federal grant. That argument is, of course, flatly inconsistent with our recent unanimous decision in Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S 141 (1989).  Although Attorney General Wirt had urged the Court to endorse our present interpretation of the Clause, its implicit limitations were unsettled when the 1831 Copyright Act was passed.

						  It is true, as the majority points out, ante at 11, n. 5, that Graham did not expressly overrule those earlier cases because Graham did not address the issue whether Congress could revive expired patents. That observation does not even arguably justify reliance on a set of old circuit court cases to support a proposition that is inconsistent with our present understanding of the limits imposed by the Copyright/Patent Clause.  After all, a unanimous Court recently endorsed the precise analysis that the majority now seeks to characterize as &#x93;wishful thinking.&#x94;  Ante, at 11, n. 5.  See Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;Congress may not create patent monopolies of unlimited duration, nor may it &#x91;authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain, or to restrict free access to materials already available&#x92; &#x94; (quoting Graham, 383 U. S., at 6 )).

						 Similarly, the validity of earlier retroactive extensions of copyright protection is not at issue in this case.  To decide the question now presented, we need not consider whether the reliance and expectation interests that have been established by prior extensions passed years ago would alter the result.  Cf. Heckler v. Mathews, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/465/728" class="subref" title="subref">465 U. S. 728</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">746</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;We have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting reasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an unconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time&#x94;).  Those interests are not at issue now, because the act under review in this case was passed only four years ago and has been under challenge in court since shortly after its enactment.

				  As I shall explain, the reasons why a State may not extend the life of a patent apply to Congress as well.  If Congress may not expand the scope of a patent monopoly, it also may not extend the life of a copyright beyond its expiration date.  Accordingly, insofar as the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.
2827, purported to extend the life of unexpired copyrights, it is invalid.  Because the majority&#x92;s contrary conclusion rests on the mistaken premise that this Court has virtually no role in reviewing congressional grants of monopoly privileges to authors, inventors and their successors, I respectfully dissent.

				The authority to issue copyrights stems from the same Clause in the Constitution that created the patent power.  It provides:

If an inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention; if he should for a long period of years retain the monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure; and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to secure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under it during his fourteen years; it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful arts, and give a premium to those, who should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries.&#x94;

It would be manifestly unfair if, after issuing a patent, the Government as a representative of the public sought to modify the bargain by shortening the term of the patent in order to accelerate public access to the invention.  The fairness considerations that underlie the constitutional protections against 
				<em>
					ex post facto
				</em>
				 laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts would presumably disable Congress from making such a retroactive change in the public&#x92;s bargain with an inventor without providing compensation for the taking.  Those same considerations should protect members of the public who make plans to exploit an invention as soon as it enters the public domain from a retroactive modification of the bargain that extends the term of the patent monopoly.  As I discuss below, the few historical exceptions to this rule do not undermine the constitutional analysis.  For quite plainly, the limitations &#x93;implicit in the Patent Clause itself,&#x94; 489 U. S., at 151, adequately explain why neither a State nor Congress may &#x93;extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date,&#x94;

				Neither the purpose of encouraging new inventions nor the overriding interest in advancing progress by adding knowledge to the public domain is served by retroactively increasing the inventor&#x92;s compensation for a completed invention and frustrating the legitimate expectations of members of the public who want to make use of it in a free market.

				 extensions of copyrights result in a gratuitous transfer of wealth from the public to authors, publishers, and their successors in interest.  Such retroactive extensions do not even arguably serve either of the purposes of the Copyright/Patent Clause.  The reasons why such extensions of the patent monopoly are unconstitutional apply to copyrights as well.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent, however, advances four arguments in support of the constitutionality of such retroactive extensions: (1) the first Copyright Act enacted shortly after the Constitution was ratified applied to works that had already been produced; (2) later Congresses have repeatedly authorized extensions of copyrights and patents; (3) such extensions promote the useful arts by giving copyright holders an incentive to preserve and restore certain valuable motion pictures; and (4) as a matter of equity, whenever Congress provides a longer term as an incentive to the creation of new works by authors, it should provide an equivalent reward to the owners of all unexpired copyrights.  None of these arguments is persuasive.

Whereas H. R. 10 would have extended patent protection to only those inventions that were &#x93;not before known or used,&#x94; H.

				The final version of the 1790 Patent Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
109, did not contain the geographic qualifier and thus did not provide for patents of importation.  This statutory omission, coupled with the contemporaneous statements by legislators, provides strong evidence that Congress recognized significant limitations on their constitutional authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause to extend protection to a class of intellectual properties.  This recognition of a categorical constitutional limitation is fundamentally at odds with the majority&#x92;s reading of Article I, &#xA7;8 to provide essentially no limit on congressional action under the Clause.  If early congressional practice does, indeed, inform our analysis, as it should, then the majority&#x92;s judicial excision of these constitutional limits cannot be correct.

				Congress also passed the first Copyright Act,

124, in 1790.  At that time there were a number of maps, charts, and books that had already been printed, some of which were copyrighted under state laws and some of which were arguably entitled to perpetual protection under the common law.  The federal statute applied to those works as well as to new works.  In some cases the application of the new federal rule reduced the pre-existing protections, and in others it may have increased the protection.  What is significant is that the statute provided a general rule creating new federal rights that supplanted the diverse state rights that previously existed.  It did not extend or attach to any of those pre-existing state and common-law rights: &#x93;That congress, in passing the act of 1790, did not legislate in reference to existing rights, appears clear.&#x94;  Wheaton

				Moreover, members of Congress in 1790 were well aware of the distinction between the creation of new copyright regimes and the extension of existing copyrights.  The 1790 Act was patterned, in many ways, after the Statute of Anne enacted in England in 1710.  8 Ann., c. 19; see

.  The English statute, in addition to providing authors with copyrights on new works for a term of 14 years renewable for another 14-year term, also replaced the booksellers&#x92; claimed perpetual rights in existing works with a single 21-year term.  In 1735, the booksellers proposed an amendment that would have extended the terms of existing copyrights until 1756, but the amendment was defeated.  Opponents of the amendment had argued that if the bill were to pass, it would &#x93;in Effect be establishing a perpetual Monopoly &#x2026; only to increase the private Gain of the Booksellers &#x2026; .&#x94;

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70, demonstrates the pitfalls of relying on an incomplete historical analysis.  Evans, an inventor who had developed several improvements in milling flour, received the third federal patent on January 7, 1791.  See Federico, Patent Trials of Oliver Evans, 27 J. Pat. Off. Soc. 586, 590 (1945).  Under the 14-year term provided by the 1790 Patent Act, this patent was to expire on January 7, 1805.  Claiming that 14 years had not provided him a sufficient time to realize income from his invention and that the net profits were spent developing improvements on the steam engine, Evans first sought an extension of his patent in December 1804.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 598; 14 Annals of Congress 1002.  Unsuccessful in 1804, he tried again in 1805, and yet again in 1806, to persuade Congress to pass his private bill.  Undaunted, Evans tried one last time to revive his expired patent after receiving an adverse judgment in an infringement action.  See 
				<em>

				v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 8 F. Cas. 837 (No. 4,555) (CC Pa. 1807).  This time, his effort at private legislation was successful and Congress passed a bill extending his patent for 14 years.  See An Act for the relief of Oliver Evans, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70.  This legislation, passed January 21, 1808, restored a patent monopoly for an invention that had been in the public domain for over four years.  As such, this Act unquestionably exceeded Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause: &#x93;The Congress in the exercise of the patent power may not overreach the restraints imposed by the stated constitutional purpose. &#x2026;

				Copyright legislation has a similar history.  The federal Copyright Act was first amended in 1831. That amendment, like later amendments, not only authorized a longer term for new works, but also extended the terms of unexpired copyrights.

				It would be particularly unwise to attach constitutional significance to the 1831 amendment because of the very different legal landscape against which it was enacted.  Congress based its authority to pass the amendment on grounds shortly thereafter declared improper by the Court.

				The majority&#x92;s reliance on the other patent case it cites is similarly misplaced.  Contrary to the suggestion in the Court&#x92;s opinion, 
				<em>

				</em>
				v. 
				<em>

				, at 10&#x96;11. The question in that case was whether the former employer of the inventor, one James Harley, could be held liable as an infringer for continuing to use the process that Harley had invented in 1834 when he was in its employ.  The Court first held that the employer&#x92;s use of the process before the patent issued was not a public use that would invalidate the patent, even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.  1 How., at 206&#x96;208.  The Court then disposed of the case on the ground that a statute enacted in 1839 protected the alleged infringer&#x92;s right to continue to use the process after the patent issued.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 209&#x96;211.  Our opinion said nothing about the power of Congress to extend the life of an issued patent.  It did note that Congress has plenary power to legislate on the subject of patents provided &#x93;that they do not take away the rights of property in existing patents.&#x94;  
				<em>

				</em>
				at 206.  The fact that Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee is, of course, fully consistent with the view that it cannot enlarge the patent monopoly to the detriment of the public after a patent has issued.

				The history of retroactive extensions of existing and expired copyrights and patents, though relevant, is not conclusive of the constitutionality of the Sonny Bono Act.  The fact that the Court has not previously passed upon the constitutionality of retroactive copyright extensions does not insulate the present extension from constitutional challenge.

				Respondent also argues that the Act promotes the useful arts by providing incentives to restore old movies.  For at least three reasons, the interest in preserving perishable copies of old copyrighted films does not justify a wholesale extension of existing copyrights.  First, such restoration and preservation will not even arguably promote any new works by authors or inventors.  And, of course, any original expression in the restoration and preservation of movies will receive new copyright protection.

            </a>
				  Second, however strong the justification for preserving such works may be, that justification applies equally to works whose copyrights have already expired.  Yet no one seriously contends that the Copyright/Patent Clause would authorize the grant of monopoly privileges for works already in the public domain solely to encourage their restoration.  Finally, even if this concern with aging movies would permit congressional protection, the remedy offered&#x97;a blanket extension of all copyrights&#x97;simply bears no relationship to the alleged harm.

				Finally, respondent relies on concerns of equity to justify the retroactive extension.  If Congress concludes that a longer period of exclusivity is necessary in order to provide an adequate incentive to authors to produce new works, respondent seems to believe that simple fairness requires that the same lengthened period be provided to authors whose works have already been completed and copyrighted.  This is a classic non sequitur.  The reason for increasing the inducement to create something new simply does not apply to an already-created work.  To the contrary, the equity argument actually provides strong support for petitioners.  Members of the public were entitled to rely on a promised access to copyrighted or patented works at the expiration of the terms specified when the exclusive privileges were granted.  On the other hand, authors will receive the full benefit of the exclusive terms that were promised as an inducement to their creativity, and have no equitable claim to increased compensation for doing nothing more.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				One must indulge in two untenable assumptions to find support in the equitable argument offered by respondent&#x97;that the public interest in free access to copyrighted works is entirely worthless and that authors, as a class, should receive a windfall solely based on completed creative activity.  Indeed, Congress has apparently indulged in those assumptions for under the series of extensions to copyrights, only one year&#x92;s worth of creative work&#x97;that copyrighted in 1923&#x97;has fallen into the public domain during the last 80 years.  But as our cases repeatedly and consistently emphasize, ultimate public access is the overriding purpose of the constitutional provision.  See,

				The express grant of a perpetual copyright would unquestionably violate the textual requirement that the authors&#x92; exclusive rights be only &#x93;for limited Times.&#x94;  Whether the extraordinary length of the grants authorized by the 1998 Act are invalid because they are the functional equivalent of perpetual copyrights is a question that need not be answered in this case because the question presented by the certiorari petition merely challenges Congress&#x92; power to extend retroactively the terms of existing copyrights.  Accordingly, there is no need to determine whether the deference that is normally given to congressional policy judgments may save from judicial review its decision respecting the appropriate length of the term.

				  It is important to note, however, that a categorical rule prohibiting retroactive extensions would effectively preclude perpetual copyrights.

				By failing to protect the public interest in free access to the products of inventive and artistic genius&#x97;indeed, by virtually ignoring the central purpose of the Copyright/Patent Clause&#x97;the Court has quitclaimed to Congress its principal responsibility in this area of the law.  Fairly read, the Court has stated that Congress&#x92; actions under the Copyright/Patent Clause are, for all intents and purposes, judicially unreviewable.  That result cannot be squared with the basic tenets of our constitutional structure.  It is not hyperbole to recall the trenchant words of Chief Justice John Marshall: &#x93;It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.&#x94;

						 Justice Harlan wrote a brief concurrence, but did not disagree with this statement.  Justice Black&#x92;s statement echoed a portion of Attorney General Wirt&#x92;s argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 171 (1824): &#x93;The law of Congress declares, that all inventors of useful improvements throughout the United States, shall be entitled to the exclusive right in their discoveries for fourteen years only.  The law of New-York declares, that this inventor shall be entitled to the exclusive use of his discovery for thirty years, and as much longer as the State shall permit.  The law of Congress, by limiting the exclusive right to fourteen years, in effect declares, that after the expiration of that time, the discovery shall be the common right of the whole people of the United States.&#x94;

						Attorney General Wirt made this precise point in his argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 175: &#x93;The limitation is not for the advantage of the inventor, but of society at large, which is to take the benefit of the invention after the period of limitation has expired.  The patentee pays a duty on his patent, which is an effective source of revenue to the United States.  It is virtually a contract between each patentee and the people of the United States, by which the time of exclusive and secure enjoyment is limited, and then the benefit of the discovery results to the public.&#x94;

						The Court acknowledges that this proposition is &#x93;uncontroversial&#x94; today, see ante, at 11, n. 6, but overlooks the fact that it was highly controversial in the early 1800&#x92;s.  See n. 11, infra.  The Court assumes that the Sears holding rested entirely on the pre-emptive effect of congressional statutes even though the opinion itself, like the opinions  in Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City,

						 &#x93;Your idea of appropriating a district of territory to the encouragement of imported inventions is new and worthy of consideration.  I can not but apprehend however that the clause in the constitution which forbids patents for that purpose will lie equally in the way of your expedient.  Congress seem to be tied down to the single mode of encouraging inventions by granting the exclusive benefit of them for a limited time, and therefore to have no more power to give a further encouragement out of a fund of land than a fund of money.  This fetter on the National Legislature tho&#x92; an unfortunate one, was a deliberate one.  The Latitude of authority now wished for was strongly urged and expressly rejected.&#x94;  Madison&#x92;s description of the Copyright/Patent Clause as a &#x93;fetter on the National Legislature&#x94; is fully consistent with this Court&#x92;s opinion in Graham.

						 Importantly, even this first Act required a quid pro quo in order to receive federal copyright protection.  In order to receive protection under the Act, the author was first required to register the work: &#x93;That no person shall be entitled to the benefit of this act, in cases where any map, chart, book or books, hath or have been already printed and published, unless he shall first deposit, and in all other cases, unless he shall before publication deposit a printed copy of the title of such map, chart, book or books, in the clerk&#x92;s office of the district court where the author or proprietor shall reside.&#x94; &#xA7;3, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124.  This registration requirement in federal district court&#x97;a requirement obviously not required under the various state laws protecting written works&#x97;further illustrates that the 1790 Act created new rights, rather than extending existing rights.

						 Respondent&#x92;s reformulation of the questions presented by this case confuses this basic distinction.  We granted certiorari to consider the question: &#x93;Did the D. C.

						 In the period before our decision in Wheaton, the pre-emptive effect of the Patent/Copyright Clause was also a matter of serious debate within the legal profession. Indeed, in their argument in this Court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 44&#x96;61, 141&#x96;157, the defenders of New York&#x92;s grant of a 30-year monopoly on the passenger trade between New Jersey and Manhattan argued that the Clause actually should be interpreted as confirming the State&#x92;s authority to grant monopoly privileges that supplemented any federal grant. That argument is, of course, flatly inconsistent with our recent unanimous decision in Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S 141 (1989).  Although Attorney General Wirt had urged the Court to endorse our present interpretation of the Clause, its implicit limitations were unsettled when the 1831 Copyright Act was passed.

						  It is true, as the majority points out, ante at 11, n. 5, that Graham did not expressly overrule those earlier cases because Graham did not address the issue whether Congress could revive expired patents. That observation does not even arguably justify reliance on a set of old circuit court cases to support a proposition that is inconsistent with our present understanding of the limits imposed by the Copyright/Patent Clause.  After all, a unanimous Court recently endorsed the precise analysis that the majority now seeks to characterize as &#x93;wishful thinking.&#x94;  Ante, at 11, n. 5.  See Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;Congress may not create patent monopolies of unlimited duration, nor may it &#x91;authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain, or to restrict free access to materials already available&#x92; &#x94; (quoting Graham, 383 U.

						 Similarly, the validity of earlier retroactive extensions of copyright protection is not at issue in this case.  To decide the question now presented, we need not consider whether the reliance and expectation interests that have been established by prior extensions passed years ago would alter the result.  Cf. Heckler v. Mathews, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/465/728" class="subref" title="subref">465 U. S. 728</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">746</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;We have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting reasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an unconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time&#x94;).  Those interests are not at issue now, because the act under review in this case was passed only four years ago and has been under challenge in court since shortly after its enactment.

				  As I shall explain, the reasons why a State may not extend the life of a patent apply to Congress as well.  If Congress may not expand the scope of a patent monopoly, it also may not extend the life of a copyright beyond its expiration date.  Accordingly, insofar as the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.
2827, purported to extend the life of unexpired copyrights, it is invalid.  Because the majority&#x92;s contrary conclusion rests on the mistaken premise that this Court has virtually no role in reviewing congressional grants of monopoly privileges to authors, inventors and their successors, I respectfully dissent.

				The authority to issue copyrights stems from the same Clause in the Constitution that created the patent power.  It provides:

If an inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention; if he should for a long period of years retain the monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure; and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to secure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under it during his fourteen years; it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful arts, and give a premium to those, who should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries.&#x94;

 (&#x93;[T]he patent system represents a carefully crafted bargain that encourages both the creation and the public disclosure of new and useful advances in technology, in return for an exclusive monopoly for a limited period of time&#x94;).  It would be manifestly unfair if, after issuing a patent, the Government as a representative of the public sought to modify the bargain by shortening the term of the patent in order to accelerate public access to the invention.  The fairness considerations that underlie the constitutional protections against 
				<em>

				 laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts would presumably disable Congress from making such a retroactive change in the public&#x92;s bargain with an inventor without providing compensation for the taking.  Those same considerations should protect members of the public who make plans to exploit an invention as soon as it enters the public domain from a retroactive modification of the bargain that extends the term of the patent monopoly.  As I discuss below, the few historical exceptions to this rule do not undermine the constitutional analysis.  For quite plainly, the limitations &#x93;implicit in the Patent Clause itself,&#x94; 489 U.

				 extensions of copyrights result in a gratuitous transfer of wealth from the public to authors, publishers, and their successors in interest.  Such retroactive extensions do not even arguably serve either of the purposes of the Copyright/Patent Clause.  The reasons why such extensions of the patent monopoly are unconstitutional apply to copyrights as well.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent, however, advances four arguments in support of the constitutionality of such retroactive extensions: (1) the first Copyright Act enacted shortly after the Constitution was ratified applied to works that had already been produced; (2) later Congresses have repeatedly authorized extensions of copyrights and patents; (3) such extensions promote the useful arts by giving copyright holders an incentive to preserve and restore certain valuable motion pictures; and (4) as a matter of equity, whenever Congress provides a longer term as an incentive to the creation of new works by authors, it should provide an equivalent reward to the owners of all unexpired copyrights.  None of these arguments is persuasive.

Whereas H. R. 10 would have extended patent protection to only those inventions that were &#x93;not before known or used,&#x94; H.

				The final version of the 1790 Patent Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
109, did not contain the geographic qualifier and thus did not provide for patents of importation.  This statutory omission, coupled with the contemporaneous statements by legislators, provides strong evidence that Congress recognized significant limitations on their constitutional authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause to extend protection to a class of intellectual properties.  This recognition of a categorical constitutional limitation is fundamentally at odds with the majority&#x92;s reading of Article I, &#xA7;8 to provide essentially no limit on congressional action under the Clause.  If early congressional practice does, indeed, inform our analysis, as it should, then the majority&#x92;s judicial excision of these constitutional limits cannot be correct.

				Congress also passed the first Copyright Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124, in 1790.  At that time there were a number of maps, charts, and books that had already been printed, some of which were copyrighted under state laws and some of which were arguably entitled to perpetual protection under the common law.  The federal statute applied to those works as well as to new works.  In some cases the application of the new federal rule reduced the pre-existing protections, and in others it may have increased the protection.  What is significant is that the statute provided a general rule creating new federal rights that supplanted the diverse state rights that previously existed.  It did not extend or attach to any of those pre-existing state and common-law rights: &#x93;That congress, in passing the act of 1790, did not legislate in reference to existing rights, appears clear.&#x94;  Wheaton

 (&#x93;As this Court has repeatedly said, the Congress did not sanction an existing right but created a new one&#x94;).

				Moreover, members of Congress in 1790 were well aware of the distinction between the creation of new copyright regimes and the extension of existing copyrights.  The 1790 Act was patterned, in many ways, after the Statute of Anne enacted in England in 1710.  8 Ann., c. 19; see

.  The English statute, in addition to providing authors with copyrights on new works for a term of 14 years renewable for another 14-year term, also replaced the booksellers&#x92; claimed perpetual rights in existing works with a single 21-year term.  In 1735, the booksellers proposed an amendment that would have extended the terms of existing copyrights until 1756, but the amendment was defeated.  Opponents of the amendment had argued that if the bill were to pass, it would &#x93;in Effect be establishing a perpetual Monopoly &#x2026; only to increase the private Gain of the Booksellers &#x2026; .&#x94;

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70, demonstrates the pitfalls of relying on an incomplete historical analysis.  Evans, an inventor who had developed several improvements in milling flour, received the third federal patent on January 7, 1791.  See Federico, Patent Trials of Oliver Evans, 27 J. Pat. Off. Soc. 586, 590 (1945).  Under the 14-year term provided by the 1790 Patent Act, this patent was to expire on January 7, 1805.  Claiming that 14 years had not provided him a sufficient time to realize income from his invention and that the net profits were spent developing improvements on the steam engine, Evans first sought an extension of his patent in December 1804.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 598; 14 Annals of Congress 1002.  Unsuccessful in 1804, he tried again in 1805, and yet again in 1806, to persuade Congress to pass his private bill.  Undaunted, Evans tried one last time to revive his expired patent after receiving an adverse judgment in an infringement action.  See 
				<em>
					Evans 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 8 F. Cas. 837 (No. 4,555) (CC Pa. 1807).  This time, his effort at private legislation was successful and Congress passed a bill extending his patent for 14 years.  See An Act for the relief of Oliver Evans, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70.  This legislation, passed January 21, 1808, restored a patent monopoly for an invention that had been in the public domain for over four years.  As such, this Act unquestionably exceeded Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause: &#x93;The Congress in the exercise of the patent power may not overreach the restraints imposed by the stated constitutional purpose. &#x2026;

				Copyright legislation has a similar history.  The federal Copyright Act was first amended in 1831. That amendment, like later amendments, not only authorized a longer term for new works, but also extended the terms of unexpired copyrights.

				It would be particularly unwise to attach constitutional significance to the 1831 amendment because of the very different legal landscape against which it was enacted.  Congress based its authority to pass the amendment on grounds shortly thereafter declared improper by the Court.  The Judiciary Committee Report prepared for the House of Representatives asserted that &#x93;an author has an exclusive and perpetual right, in preference to any other, to the fruits of his labor.&#x94;  7 Gales &amp; Seaton, Register of Debates in Congress cxx (1831).

				In 1861, Congress amended the term of patents, from a 14-year term plus opportunity for 7-year extension to a flat 17 years with no extension permitted.  Act of Mar. 2, 1861, ch. 88, &#xA7;16,

				  To be sure, Congress, at many times in its history, has retroactively extended the terms of existing copyrights and patents.  This history, however, reveals a much more heterogeneous practice than respondent contends.  It is replete with actions that were unquestionably unconstitutional.  Though relevant, the history is not dispositive of the constitutionality of Sonny Bono Act.

				The general presumption that historic practice illuminates the constitutionality of congressional action is not controlling in this case.  That presumption is strongest when the earliest acts of Congress are considered, for the overlap of identity between those who created the Constitution and those who first constituted Congress provides &#x93;contemporaneous and weighty evidence&#x94; of the Constitution&#x92;s &#x93;true meaning.&#x94;

				The majority&#x92;s reliance on the other patent case it cites is similarly misplaced.  Contrary to the suggestion in the Court&#x92;s opinion, 
				<em>
					McClurg 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>

				1 How. 202 (1843), did not involve the &#x93;legislative expansion&#x94; of an existing patent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10&#x96;11. The question in that case was whether the former employer of the inventor, one James Harley, could be held liable as an infringer for continuing to use the process that Harley had invented in 1834 when he was in its employ.  The Court first held that the employer&#x92;s use of the process before the patent issued was not a public use that would invalidate the patent, even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.  1 How., at 206&#x96;208.  The Court then disposed of the case on the ground that a statute enacted in 1839 protected the alleged infringer&#x92;s right to continue to use the process after the patent issued.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 209&#x96;211.  Our opinion said nothing about the power of Congress to extend the life of an issued patent.  It did note that Congress has plenary power to legislate on the subject of patents provided &#x93;that they do not take away the rights of property in existing patents.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 206.  The fact that Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee is, of course, fully consistent with the view that it cannot enlarge the patent monopoly to the detriment of the public after a patent has issued.

				The history of retroactive extensions of existing and expired copyrights and patents, though relevant, is not conclusive of the constitutionality of the Sonny Bono Act.

				Respondent also argues that the Act promotes the useful arts by providing incentives to restore old movies.  For at least three reasons, the interest in preserving perishable copies of old copyrighted films does not justify a wholesale extension of existing copyrights.  First, such restoration and preservation will not even arguably promote any new works by authors or inventors.  And, of course, any original expression in the restoration and preservation of movies will receive new copyright protection.

            </a>
				  Second, however strong the justification for preserving such works may be, that justification applies equally to works whose copyrights have already expired.  Yet no one seriously contends that the Copyright/Patent Clause would authorize the grant of monopoly privileges for works already in the public domain solely to encourage their restoration.  Finally, even if this concern with aging movies would permit congressional protection, the remedy offered&#x97;a blanket extension of all copyrights&#x97;simply bears no relationship to the alleged harm.

        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Finally, respondent relies on concerns of equity to justify the retroactive extension.  If Congress concludes that a longer period of exclusivity is necessary in order to provide an adequate incentive to authors to produce new works, respondent seems to believe that simple fairness requires that the same lengthened period be provided to authors whose works have already been completed and copyrighted.  This is a classic non sequitur.  The reason for increasing the inducement to create something new simply does not apply to an already-created work.  To the contrary, the equity argument actually provides strong support for petitioners.  Members of the public were entitled to rely on a promised access to copyrighted or patented works at the expiration of the terms specified when the exclusive privileges were granted.  On the other hand, authors will receive the full benefit of the exclusive terms that were promised as an inducement to their creativity, and have no equitable claim to increased compensation for doing nothing more.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				One must indulge in two untenable assumptions to find support in the equitable argument offered by respondent&#x97;that the public interest in free access to copyrighted works is entirely worthless and that authors, as a class, should receive a windfall solely based on completed creative activity.  Indeed, Congress has apparently indulged in those assumptions for under the series of extensions to copyrights, only one year&#x92;s worth of creative work&#x97;that copyrighted in 1923&#x97;has fallen into the public domain during the last 80 years.  But as our cases repeatedly and consistently emphasize, ultimate public access is the overriding purpose of the constitutional provision.  See,

				The express grant of a perpetual copyright would unquestionably violate the textual requirement that the authors&#x92; exclusive rights be only &#x93;for limited Times.&#x94;  Whether the extraordinary length of the grants authorized by the 1998 Act are invalid because they are the functional equivalent of perpetual copyrights is a question that need not be answered in this case because the question presented by the certiorari petition merely challenges Congress&#x92; power to extend retroactively the terms of existing copyrights.  Accordingly, there is no need to determine whether the deference that is normally given to congressional policy judgments may save from judicial review its decision respecting the appropriate length of the term.

				  It is important to note, however, that a categorical rule prohibiting retroactive extensions would effectively preclude perpetual copyrights.  More importantly, as the House of Lords recognized when it refused to amend the Statute of Anne in 1735, unless the Clause is construed to embody such a categorical rule, Congress may extend existing monopoly privileges

				By failing to protect the public interest in free access to the products of inventive and artistic genius&#x97;indeed, by virtually ignoring the central purpose of the Copyright/Patent Clause&#x97;the Court has quitclaimed to Congress its principal responsibility in this area of the law.  Fairly read, the Court has stated that Congress&#x92; actions under the Copyright/Patent Clause are, for all intents and purposes, judicially unreviewable.  That result cannot be squared with the basic tenets of our constitutional structure.

						 Justice Harlan wrote a brief concurrence, but did not disagree with this statement.  Justice Black&#x92;s statement echoed a portion of Attorney General Wirt&#x92;s argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 171 (1824): &#x93;The law of Congress declares, that all inventors of useful improvements throughout the United States, shall be entitled to the exclusive right in their discoveries for fourteen years only.  The law of New-York declares, that this inventor shall be entitled to the exclusive use of his discovery for thirty years, and as much longer as the State shall permit.  The law of Congress, by limiting the exclusive right to fourteen years, in effect declares, that after the expiration of that time, the discovery shall be the common right of the whole people of the United States.&#x94;

						Attorney General Wirt made this precise point in his argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 175: &#x93;The limitation is not for the advantage of the inventor, but of society at large, which is to take the benefit of the invention after the period of limitation has expired.  The patentee pays a duty on his patent, which is an effective source of revenue to the United States.  It is virtually a contract between each patentee and the people of the United States, by which the time of exclusive and secure enjoyment is limited, and then the benefit of the discovery results to the public.&#x94;

						The Court acknowledges that this proposition is &#x93;uncontroversial&#x94; today, see ante, at 11, n. 6, but overlooks the fact that it was highly controversial in the early 1800&#x92;s.  See n. 11, infra.  The Court assumes that the Sears holding rested entirely on the pre-emptive effect of congressional statutes even though the opinion itself, like the opinions  in Graham v.

						 &#x93;Your idea of appropriating a district of territory to the encouragement of imported inventions is new and worthy of consideration.  I can not but apprehend however that the clause in the constitution which forbids patents for that purpose will lie equally in the way of your expedient.  Congress seem to be tied down to the single mode of encouraging inventions by granting the exclusive benefit of them for a limited time, and therefore to have no more power to give a further encouragement out of a fund of land than a fund of money.  This fetter on the National Legislature tho&#x92; an unfortunate one, was a deliberate one.  The Latitude of authority now wished for was strongly urged and expressly rejected.&#x94;  Madison&#x92;s description of the Copyright/Patent Clause as a &#x93;fetter on the National Legislature&#x94; is fully consistent with this Court&#x92;s opinion in Graham.

						 Importantly, even this first Act required a quid pro quo in order to receive federal copyright protection.  In order to receive protection under the Act, the author was first required to register the work: &#x93;That no person shall be entitled to the benefit of this act, in cases where any map, chart, book or books, hath or have been already printed and published, unless he shall first deposit, and in all other cases, unless he shall before publication deposit a printed copy of the title of such map, chart, book or books, in the clerk&#x92;s office of the district court where the author or proprietor shall reside.&#x94; &#xA7;3,

						 In the period before our decision in Wheaton, the pre-emptive effect of the Patent/Copyright Clause was also a matter of serious debate within the legal profession. Indeed, in their argument in this Court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 44&#x96;61, 141&#x96;157, the defenders of New York&#x92;s grant of a 30-year monopoly on the passenger trade between New Jersey and Manhattan argued that the Clause actually should be interpreted as confirming the State&#x92;s authority to grant monopoly privileges that supplemented any federal grant. That argument is, of course, flatly inconsistent with our recent unanimous decision in Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S 141 (1989).  Although Attorney General Wirt had urged the Court to endorse our present interpretation of the Clause, its implicit limitations were unsettled when the 1831 Copyright Act was passed.

						  It is true, as the majority points out, ante at 11, n. 5, that Graham did not expressly overrule those earlier cases because Graham did not address the issue whether Congress could revive expired patents. That observation does not even arguably justify reliance on a set of old circuit court cases to support a proposition that is inconsistent with our present understanding of the limits imposed by the Copyright/Patent Clause.  After all, a unanimous Court recently endorsed the precise analysis that the majority now seeks to characterize as &#x93;wishful thinking.&#x94;  Ante, at 11, n. 5.  See Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;Congress may not create patent monopolies of unlimited duration, nor may it &#x91;authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain, or to restrict free access to materials already available&#x92; &#x94; (quoting Graham, 383 U.

						 Similarly, the validity of earlier retroactive extensions of copyright protection is not at issue in this case.  To decide the question now presented, we need not consider whether the reliance and expectation interests that have been established by prior extensions passed years ago would alter the result.  Cf. Heckler v. Mathews, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/465/728" class="subref" title="subref">465 U. S. 728</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">746</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;We have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting reasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an unconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time&#x94;).  Those interests are not at issue now, because the act under review in this case was passed only four years ago and has been under challenge in court since shortly after its enactment.

				  As I shall explain, the reasons why a State may not extend the life of a patent apply to Congress as well.  If Congress may not expand the scope of a patent monopoly, it also may not extend the life of a copyright beyond its expiration date.  Accordingly, insofar as the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.
2827, purported to extend the life of unexpired copyrights, it is invalid.  Because the majority&#x92;s contrary conclusion rests on the mistaken premise that this Court has virtually no role in reviewing congressional grants of monopoly privileges to authors, inventors and their successors, I respectfully dissent.

If an inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention; if he should for a long period of years retain the monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure; and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to secure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under it during his fourteen years; it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful arts, and give a premium to those, who should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries.&#x94;

 (&#x93;[T]he patent system represents a carefully crafted bargain that encourages both the creation and the public disclosure of new and useful advances in technology, in return for an exclusive monopoly for a limited period of time&#x94;).  It would be manifestly unfair if, after issuing a patent, the Government as a representative of the public sought to modify the bargain by shortening the term of the patent in order to accelerate public access to the invention.  The fairness considerations that underlie the constitutional protections against 
				<em>
					ex post facto
				</em>
				 laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts would presumably disable Congress from making such a retroactive change in the public&#x92;s bargain with an inventor without providing compensation for the taking.  Those same considerations should protect members of the public who make plans to exploit an invention as soon as it enters the public domain from a retroactive modification of the bargain that extends the term of the patent monopoly.  As I discuss below, the few historical exceptions to this rule do not undermine the constitutional analysis.  For quite plainly, the limitations &#x93;implicit in the Patent Clause itself,&#x94; 489 U. S., at 151, adequately explain why neither a State nor Congress may &#x93;extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date,&#x94;

				 extensions of copyrights result in a gratuitous transfer of wealth from the public to authors, publishers, and their successors in interest.  Such retroactive extensions do not even arguably serve either of the purposes of the Copyright/Patent Clause.  The reasons why such extensions of the patent monopoly are unconstitutional apply to copyrights as well.

				Respondent, however, advances four arguments in support of the constitutionality of such retroactive extensions: (1) the first Copyright Act enacted shortly after the Constitution was ratified applied to works that had already been produced; (2) later Congresses have repeatedly authorized extensions of copyrights and patents; (3) such extensions promote the useful arts by giving copyright holders an incentive to preserve and restore certain valuable motion pictures; and (4) as a matter of equity, whenever Congress provides a longer term as an incentive to the creation of new works by authors, it should provide an equivalent reward to the owners of all unexpired copyrights.  None of these arguments is persuasive.

This statutory omission, coupled with the contemporaneous statements by legislators, provides strong evidence that Congress recognized significant limitations on their constitutional authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause to extend protection to a class of intellectual properties.  This recognition of a categorical constitutional limitation is fundamentally at odds with the majority&#x92;s reading of Article I, &#xA7;8 to provide essentially no limit on congressional action under the Clause.

				Congress also passed the first Copyright Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124, in 1790.  At that time there were a number of maps, charts, and books that had already been printed, some of which were copyrighted under state laws and some of which were arguably entitled to perpetual protection under the common law.  The federal statute applied to those works as well as to new works.  In some cases the application of the new federal rule reduced the pre-existing protections, and in others it may have increased the protection.  What is significant is that the statute provided a general rule creating new federal rights that supplanted the diverse state rights that previously existed.  It did not extend or attach to any of those pre-existing state and common-law rights: &#x93;That congress, in passing the act of 1790, did not legislate in reference to existing rights, appears clear.&#x94;  Wheaton

 (&#x93;As this Court has repeatedly said, the Congress did not sanction an existing right but created a new one&#x94;).  Congress set in place a federal structure governing certain types of intellectual property for the new Republic.  That Congress exercised its unquestionable constitutional authority to

				  Precisely put, the question presented by this case does not even implicate the 1790 Act, for that Act created, rather than extended, copyright protection.

				Moreover, members of Congress in 1790 were well aware of the distinction between the creation of new copyright regimes and the extension of existing copyrights.  The 1790 Act was patterned, in many ways, after the Statute of Anne enacted in England in 1710.  8 Ann., c. 19; see

.  The English statute, in addition to providing authors with copyrights on new works for a term of 14 years renewable for another 14-year term, also replaced the booksellers&#x92; claimed perpetual rights in existing works with a single 21-year term.

				Since the creation of federal patent and copyright protection in 1790, Congress has passed a variety of legislation, both providing specific relief for individual authors and inventors as well as changing the general statutes conferring patent and copyright privileges.  Some of the changes did indeed, as the majority describes, extend existing protections retroactively.  Other changes, however, did not do so.  A more complete and comprehensive look at the history of congressional action under the

				The first example relied upon by respondent, the extension of Oliver Evans&#x92; patent in 1808, ch. 8, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70, demonstrates the pitfalls of relying on an incomplete historical analysis.  Evans, an inventor who had developed several improvements in milling flour, received the third federal patent on January 7, 1791.  See Federico, Patent Trials of Oliver Evans, 27 J. Pat. Off. Soc. 586, 590 (1945).  Under the 14-year term provided by the 1790 Patent Act, this patent was to expire on January 7, 1805.  Claiming that 14 years had not provided him a sufficient time to realize income from his invention and that the net profits were spent developing improvements on the steam engine, Evans first sought an extension of his patent in December 1804.  
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 598; 14 Annals of Congress 1002.  Unsuccessful in 1804, he tried again in 1805, and yet again in 1806, to persuade Congress to pass his private bill.  Undaunted, Evans tried one last time to revive his expired patent after receiving an adverse judgment in an infringement action.  See

				v. 
				<em>

				, 8 F. Cas. 837 (No. 4,555) (CC Pa. 1807).  This time, his effort at private legislation was successful and Congress passed a bill extending his patent for 14 years.  See An Act for the relief of Oliver Evans, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70.  This legislation, passed January 21, 1808, restored a patent monopoly for an invention that had been in the public domain for over four years.  As such, this Act unquestionably exceeded Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause: &#x93;The Congress in the exercise of the patent power may not overreach the restraints imposed by the stated constitutional purpose. &#x2026;

				This extension of patent protection to an expired patent was not an isolated incident.  Congress passed private bills either directly extending patents or allowing otherwise untimely applicants to apply for patent extensions for approximately 75 patents between 1790 and 1875.  Of these 75 patents, at least 56 had already fallen into the public domain.

				Copyright legislation has a similar history.  The federal Copyright Act was first amended in 1831. That amendment, like later amendments, not only authorized a longer term for new works, but also extended the terms of unexpired copyrights.  Respondent argues that that historical practice effectively establishes the constitutionality of retroactive extensions of unexpired copyrights.  Of course, the practice buttressess the presumption of validity that attaches to every Act of Congress.  But, as our decision in

				It would be particularly unwise to attach constitutional significance to the 1831 amendment because of the very different legal landscape against which it was enacted.  Congress based its authority to pass the amendment on grounds shortly thereafter declared improper by the Court.  The Judiciary Committee Report prepared for the House of Representatives asserted that &#x93;an author has an exclusive and perpetual right, in preference to any other, to the fruits of his labor.&#x94;  7 Gales &amp; Seaton, Register of Debates in Congress cxx (1831).

				In 1861, Congress amended the term of patents, from a 14-year term plus opportunity for 7-year extension to a flat 17 years with no extension permitted.  Act of Mar. 2, 1861, ch. 88, &#xA7;16,

				  To be sure, Congress, at many times in its history, has retroactively extended the terms of existing copyrights and patents.

				The general presumption that historic practice illuminates the constitutionality of congressional action is not controlling in this case.  That presumption is strongest when the earliest acts of Congress are considered, for the overlap of identity between those who created the Constitution and those who first constituted Congress provides &#x93;contemporaneous and weighty evidence&#x94; of the Constitution&#x92;s &#x93;true meaning.&#x94;

				The majority&#x92;s reliance on the other patent case it cites is similarly misplaced.  Contrary to the suggestion in the Court&#x92;s opinion, 
				<em>
					McClurg 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Kingsland, 
				</em>
				1 How. 202 (1843), did not involve the &#x93;legislative expansion&#x94; of an existing patent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10&#x96;11. The question in that case was whether the former employer of the inventor, one James Harley, could be held liable as an infringer for continuing to use the process that Harley had invented in 1834 when he was in its employ.  The Court first held that the employer&#x92;s use of the process before the patent issued was not a public use that would invalidate the patent, even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.  1 How., at 206&#x96;208.  The Court then disposed of the case on the ground that a statute enacted in 1839 protected the alleged infringer&#x92;s right to continue to use the process after the patent issued.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 209&#x96;211.  Our opinion said nothing about the power of Congress to extend the life of an issued patent.  It did note that Congress has plenary power to legislate on the subject of patents provided &#x93;that they do not take away the rights of property in existing patents.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 206.  The fact that Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee is, of course, fully consistent with the view that it cannot enlarge the patent monopoly to the detriment of the public after a patent has issued.

				Respondent also argues that the Act promotes the useful arts by providing incentives to restore old movies.  For at least three reasons, the interest in preserving perishable copies of old copyrighted films does not justify a wholesale extension of existing copyrights.  First, such restoration and preservation will not even arguably promote any new works by authors or inventors.  And, of course, any original expression in the restoration and preservation of movies will receive new copyright protection.

            </a>
				  Second, however strong the justification for preserving such works may be, that justification applies equally to works whose copyrights have already expired.  Yet no one seriously contends that the Copyright/Patent Clause would authorize the grant of monopoly privileges for works already in the public domain solely to encourage their restoration.  Finally, even if this concern with aging movies would permit congressional protection, the remedy offered&#x97;a blanket extension of all copyrights&#x97;simply bears no relationship to the alleged harm.

        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Finally, respondent relies on concerns of equity to justify the retroactive extension.  If Congress concludes that a longer period of exclusivity is necessary in order to provide an adequate incentive to authors to produce new works, respondent seems to believe that simple fairness requires that the same lengthened period be provided to authors whose works have already been completed and copyrighted.  This is a classic non sequitur.  The reason for increasing the inducement to create something new simply does not apply to an already-created work.  To the contrary, the equity argument actually provides strong support for petitioners.  Members of the public were entitled to rely on a promised access to copyrighted or patented works at the expiration of the terms specified when the exclusive privileges were granted.  On the other hand, authors will receive the full benefit of the exclusive terms that were promised as an inducement to their creativity, and have no equitable claim to increased compensation for doing nothing more.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				One must indulge in two untenable assumptions to find support in the equitable argument offered by respondent&#x97;that the public interest in free access to copyrighted works is entirely worthless and that authors, as a class, should receive a windfall solely based on completed creative activity.  Indeed, Congress has apparently indulged in those assumptions for under the series of extensions to copyrights, only one year&#x92;s worth of creative work&#x97;that copyrighted in 1923&#x97;has fallen into the public domain during the last 80 years.  But as our cases repeatedly and consistently emphasize, ultimate public access is the overriding purpose of the constitutional provision.  See,

            <em>
					Sony Corp.,

				The express grant of a perpetual copyright would unquestionably violate the textual requirement that the authors&#x92; exclusive rights be only &#x93;for limited Times.&#x94;  Whether the extraordinary length of the grants authorized by the 1998 Act are invalid because they are the functional equivalent of perpetual copyrights is a question that need not be answered in this case because the question presented by the certiorari petition merely challenges Congress&#x92; power to extend retroactively the terms of existing copyrights.  Accordingly, there is no need to determine whether the deference that is normally given to congressional policy judgments may save from judicial review its decision respecting the appropriate length of the term.

				  It is important to note, however, that a categorical rule prohibiting retroactive extensions would effectively preclude perpetual copyrights.

						 Justice Harlan wrote a brief concurrence, but did not disagree with this statement.  Justice Black&#x92;s statement echoed a portion of Attorney General Wirt&#x92;s argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 171 (1824): &#x93;The law of Congress declares, that all inventors of useful improvements throughout the United States, shall be entitled to the exclusive right in their discoveries for fourteen years only.  The law of New-York declares, that this inventor shall be entitled to the exclusive use of his discovery for thirty years, and as much longer as the State shall permit.  The law of Congress, by limiting the exclusive right to fourteen years, in effect declares, that after the expiration of that time, the discovery shall be the common right of the whole people of the United States.&#x94;

						Attorney General Wirt made this precise point in his argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 175: &#x93;The limitation is not for the advantage of the inventor, but of society at large, which is to take the benefit of the invention after the period of limitation has expired.  The patentee pays a duty on his patent, which is an effective source of revenue to the United States.  It is virtually a contract between each patentee and the people of the United States, by which the time of exclusive and secure enjoyment is limited, and then the benefit of the discovery results to the public.&#x94;

Congress seem to be tied down to the single mode of encouraging inventions by granting the exclusive benefit of them for a limited time, and therefore to have no more power to give a further encouragement out of a fund of land than a fund of money.  This fetter on the National Legislature tho&#x92; an unfortunate one, was a deliberate one.  The Latitude of authority now wished for was strongly urged and expressly rejected.&#x94;  Madison&#x92;s description of the Copyright/Patent Clause as a &#x93;fetter on the National Legislature&#x94; is fully consistent with this Court&#x92;s opinion in Graham.

						 Importantly, even this first Act required a quid pro quo in order to receive federal copyright protection.  In order to receive protection under the Act, the author was first required to register the work: &#x93;That no person shall be entitled to the benefit of this act, in cases where any map, chart, book or books, hath or have been already printed and published, unless he shall first deposit, and in all other cases, unless he shall before publication deposit a printed copy of the title of such map, chart, book or books, in the clerk&#x92;s office of the district court where the author or proprietor shall reside.&#x94; &#xA7;3,

124.  This registration requirement in federal district court&#x97;a requirement obviously not required under the various state laws protecting written works&#x97;further illustrates that the 1790 Act created new rights, rather than extending existing rights.

						 In the period before our decision in Wheaton, the pre-emptive effect of the Patent/Copyright Clause was also a matter of serious debate within the legal profession. Indeed, in their argument in this Court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 44&#x96;61, 141&#x96;157, the defenders of New York&#x92;s grant of a 30-year monopoly on the passenger trade between New Jersey and Manhattan argued that the Clause actually should be interpreted as confirming the State&#x92;s authority to grant monopoly privileges that supplemented any federal grant. That argument is, of course, flatly inconsistent with our recent unanimous decision in Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S 141 (1989).  Although Attorney General Wirt had urged the Court to endorse our present interpretation of the Clause, its implicit limitations were unsettled when the 1831 Copyright Act was passed.

						  It is true, as the majority points out, ante at 11, n. 5, that Graham did not expressly overrule those earlier cases because Graham did not address the issue whether Congress could revive expired patents. That observation does not even arguably justify reliance on a set of old circuit court cases to support a proposition that is inconsistent with our present understanding of the limits imposed by the Copyright/Patent Clause.  After all, a unanimous Court recently endorsed the precise analysis that the majority now seeks to characterize as &#x93;wishful thinking.&#x94;  Ante, at 11, n. 5.  See Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;Congress may not create patent monopolies of unlimited duration, nor may it &#x91;authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain, or to restrict free access to materials already available&#x92; &#x94; (quoting Graham, 383 U.

						 Similarly, the validity of earlier retroactive extensions of copyright protection is not at issue in this case.  To decide the question now presented, we need not consider whether the reliance and expectation interests that have been established by prior extensions passed years ago would alter the result.  Cf. Heckler v. Mathews, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/465/728" class="subref" title="subref">465 U. S. 728</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">746</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;We have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting reasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an unconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time&#x94;).  Those interests are not at issue now, because the act under review in this case was passed only four years ago and has been under challenge in court since shortly after its enactment.

				  As I shall explain, the reasons why a State may not extend the life of a patent apply to Congress as well.  If Congress may not expand the scope of a patent monopoly, it also may not extend the life of a copyright beyond its expiration date.  Accordingly, insofar as the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.
2827, purported to extend the life of unexpired copyrights, it is invalid.  Because the majority&#x92;s contrary conclusion rests on the mistaken premise that this Court has virtually no role in reviewing congressional grants of monopoly privileges to authors, inventors and their successors, I respectfully dissent.

If an inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention; if he should for a long period of years retain the monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure; and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to secure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under it during his fourteen years; it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful arts, and give a premium to those, who should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries.&#x94;

 (&#x93;[T]he patent system represents a carefully crafted bargain that encourages both the creation and the public disclosure of new and useful advances in technology, in return for an exclusive monopoly for a limited period of time&#x94;).  It would be manifestly unfair if, after issuing a patent, the Government as a representative of the public sought to modify the bargain by shortening the term of the patent in order to accelerate public access to the invention.  The fairness considerations that underlie the constitutional protections against 
				<em>
					ex post facto
				</em>
				 laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts would presumably disable Congress from making such a retroactive change in the public&#x92;s bargain with an inventor without providing compensation for the taking.  Those same considerations should protect members of the public who make plans to exploit an invention as soon as it enters the public domain from a retroactive modification of the bargain that extends the term of the patent monopoly.  As I discuss below, the few historical exceptions to this rule do not undermine the constitutional analysis.  For quite plainly, the limitations &#x93;implicit in the Patent Clause itself,&#x94; 489 U. S., at 151, adequately explain why neither a State nor Congress may &#x93;extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date,&#x94;

				Neither the purpose of encouraging new inventions nor the overriding interest in advancing progress by adding knowledge to the public domain is served by retroactively increasing the inventor&#x92;s compensation for a completed invention and frustrating the legitimate expectations of members of the public who want to make use of it in a free market.

				 extensions of copyrights result in a gratuitous transfer of wealth from the public to authors, publishers, and their successors in interest.  Such retroactive extensions do not even arguably serve either of the purposes of the Copyright/Patent Clause.  The reasons why such extensions of the patent monopoly are unconstitutional apply to copyrights as well.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent, however, advances four arguments in support of the constitutionality of such retroactive extensions: (1) the first Copyright Act enacted shortly after the Constitution was ratified applied to works that had already been produced; (2) later Congresses have repeatedly authorized extensions of copyrights and patents; (3) such extensions promote the useful arts by giving copyright holders an incentive to preserve and restore certain valuable motion pictures; and (4) as a matter of equity, whenever Congress provides a longer term as an incentive to the creation of new works by authors, it should provide an equivalent reward to the owners of all unexpired copyrights.  None of these arguments is persuasive.

R. 41, by contrast, added the phrase &#x93;within the United States&#x94; to that limitation and expressly authorized patent protection for &#x93;any person, who shall after the passing of this act, first import into the United States . . . any . . . device . . . not before used or known in the said States.&#x94;  6 Documentary History,

Though exact records of the floor debate are lost, correspondence from House members indicate that doubts about the constitutionality of such a provision led to its removal.

				The final version of the 1790 Patent Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
109, did not contain the geographic qualifier and thus did not provide for patents of importation.  This statutory omission, coupled with the contemporaneous statements by legislators, provides strong evidence that Congress recognized significant limitations on their constitutional authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause to extend protection to a class of intellectual properties.  This recognition of a categorical constitutional limitation is fundamentally at odds with the majority&#x92;s reading of Article I, &#xA7;8 to provide essentially no limit on congressional action under the Clause.  If early congressional practice does, indeed, inform our analysis, as it should, then the majority&#x92;s judicial excision of these constitutional limits cannot be correct.

				Congress also passed the first Copyright Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124, in 1790.  At that time there were a number of maps, charts, and books that had already been printed, some of which were copyrighted under state laws and some of which were arguably entitled to perpetual protection under the common law.  The federal statute applied to those works as well as to new works.  In some cases the application of the new federal rule reduced the pre-existing protections, and in others it may have increased the protection.  What is significant is that the statute provided a general rule creating new federal rights that supplanted the diverse state rights that previously existed.  It did not extend or attach to any of those pre-existing state and common-law rights: &#x93;That congress, in passing the act of 1790, did not legislate in reference to existing rights, appears clear.&#x94;  Wheaton

 (&#x93;As this Court has repeatedly said, the Congress did not sanction an existing right but created a new one&#x94;).  Congress set in place a federal structure governing certain types of intellectual property for the new Republic.  That Congress exercised its unquestionable constitutional authority to

				  Precisely put, the question presented by this case does not even implicate the 1790 Act, for that Act created, rather than extended, copyright protection.

				Moreover, members of Congress in 1790 were well aware of the distinction between the creation of new copyright regimes and the extension of existing copyrights.  The 1790 Act was patterned, in many ways, after the Statute of Anne enacted in England in 1710.  8 Ann., c. 19; see

.  The English statute, in addition to providing authors with copyrights on new works for a term of 14 years renewable for another 14-year term, also replaced the booksellers&#x92; claimed perpetual rights in existing works with a single 21-year term.  In 1735, the booksellers proposed an amendment that would have extended the terms of existing copyrights until 1756, but the amendment was defeated.  Opponents of the amendment had argued that if the bill were to pass, it would &#x93;in Effect be establishing a perpetual Monopoly &#x2026; only to increase the private Gain of the Booksellers &#x2026; .&#x94;

				Since the creation of federal patent and copyright protection in 1790, Congress has passed a variety of legislation, both providing specific relief for individual authors and inventors as well as changing the general statutes conferring patent and copyright privileges.  Some of the changes did indeed, as the majority describes, extend existing protections retroactively.  Other changes, however, did not do so.  A more complete and comprehensive look at the history of congressional action under the

				Congress, aside from changing the process of applying for a patent in the 1793 Patent Act, did not significantly alter the basic patent and copyright systems for the next 40 years.  During this time, however, Congress did consider many private bills.

				The first example relied upon by respondent, the extension of Oliver Evans&#x92; patent in 1808, ch. 8, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70, demonstrates the pitfalls of relying on an incomplete historical analysis.  Evans, an inventor who had developed several improvements in milling flour, received the third federal patent on January 7, 1791.  See Federico, Patent Trials of Oliver Evans, 27 J. Pat. Off. Soc. 586, 590 (1945).  Under the 14-year term provided by the 1790 Patent Act, this patent was to expire on January 7, 1805.  Claiming that 14 years had not provided him a sufficient time to realize income from his invention and that the net profits were spent developing improvements on the steam engine, Evans first sought an extension of his patent in December 1804.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 598; 14 Annals of Congress 1002.  Unsuccessful in 1804, he tried again in 1805, and yet again in 1806, to persuade Congress to pass his private bill.  Undaunted, Evans tried one last time to revive his expired patent after receiving an adverse judgment in an infringement action.  See 
				<em>
					Evans 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 8 F. Cas. 837 (No. 4,555) (CC Pa. 1807).  This time, his effort at private legislation was successful and Congress passed a bill extending his patent for 14 years.  See An Act for the relief of Oliver Evans, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70.  This legislation, passed January 21, 1808, restored a patent monopoly for an invention that had been in the public domain for over four years.  As such, this Act unquestionably exceeded Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause: &#x93;The Congress in the exercise of the patent power may not overreach the restraints imposed by the stated constitutional purpose. &#x2026;

				This extension of patent protection to an expired patent was not an isolated incident.  Congress passed private bills either directly extending patents or allowing otherwise untimely applicants to apply for patent extensions for approximately 75 patents between 1790 and 1875.  Of these 75 patents, at least 56 had already fallen into the public domain.

				Copyright legislation has a similar history.  The federal Copyright Act was first amended in 1831. That amendment, like later amendments, not only authorized a longer term for new works, but also extended the terms of unexpired copyrights.  Respondent argues that that historical practice effectively establishes the constitutionality of retroactive extensions of unexpired copyrights.  Of course, the practice buttressess the presumption of validity that attaches to every Act of Congress.  But, as our decision in

				<em>

				It would be particularly unwise to attach constitutional significance to the 1831 amendment because of the very different legal landscape against which it was enacted.  Congress based its authority to pass the amendment on grounds shortly thereafter declared improper by the Court.  The Judiciary Committee Report prepared for the House of Representatives asserted that &#x93;an author has an exclusive and perpetual right, in preference to any other, to the fruits of his labor.&#x94;  7 Gales &amp; Seaton, Register of Debates in Congress cxx (1831).

				The general presumption that historic practice illuminates the constitutionality of congressional action is not controlling in this case.

				The majority&#x92;s reliance on the other patent case it cites is similarly misplaced.  Contrary to the suggestion in the Court&#x92;s opinion, 
				<em>

				</em>
				v. 
				<em>

				, at 10&#x96;11. The question in that case was whether the former employer of the inventor, one James Harley, could be held liable as an infringer for continuing to use the process that Harley had invented in 1834 when he was in its employ.  The Court first held that the employer&#x92;s use of the process before the patent issued was not a public use that would invalidate the patent, even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.  1 How., at 206&#x96;208.  The Court then disposed of the case on the ground that a statute enacted in 1839 protected the alleged infringer&#x92;s right to continue to use the process after the patent issued.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 209&#x96;211.  Our opinion said nothing about the power of Congress to extend the life of an issued patent.  It did note that Congress has plenary power to legislate on the subject of patents provided &#x93;that they do not take away the rights of property in existing patents.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 206.  The fact that Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee is, of course, fully consistent with the view that it cannot enlarge the patent monopoly to the detriment of the public after a patent has issued.

				Respondent also argues that the Act promotes the useful arts by providing incentives to restore old movies.  For at least three reasons, the interest in preserving perishable copies of old copyrighted films does not justify a wholesale extension of existing copyrights.  First, such restoration and preservation will not even arguably promote any new works by authors or inventors.  And, of course, any original expression in the restoration and preservation of movies will receive new copyright protection.

            </a>
				  Second, however strong the justification for preserving such works may be, that justification applies equally to works whose copyrights have already expired.  Yet no one seriously contends that the Copyright/Patent Clause would authorize the grant of monopoly privileges for works already in the public domain solely to encourage their restoration.  Finally, even if this concern with aging movies would permit congressional protection, the remedy offered&#x97;a blanket extension of all copyrights&#x97;simply bears no relationship to the alleged harm.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Finally, respondent relies on concerns of equity to justify the retroactive extension.  If Congress concludes that a longer period of exclusivity is necessary in order to provide an adequate incentive to authors to produce new works, respondent seems to believe that simple fairness requires that the same lengthened period be provided to authors whose works have already been completed and copyrighted.  This is a classic non sequitur.  The reason for increasing the inducement to create something new simply does not apply to an already-created work.  To the contrary, the equity argument actually provides strong support for petitioners.  Members of the public were entitled to rely on a promised access to copyrighted or patented works at the expiration of the terms specified when the exclusive privileges were granted.  On the other hand, authors will receive the full benefit of the exclusive terms that were promised as an inducement to their creativity, and have no equitable claim to increased compensation for doing nothing more.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				One must indulge in two untenable assumptions to find support in the equitable argument offered by respondent&#x97;that the public interest in free access to copyrighted works is entirely worthless and that authors, as a class, should receive a windfall solely based on completed creative activity.  Indeed, Congress has apparently indulged in those assumptions for under the series of extensions to copyrights, only one year&#x92;s worth of creative work&#x97;that copyrighted in 1923&#x97;has fallen into the public domain during the last 80 years.  But as our cases repeatedly and consistently emphasize, ultimate public access is the overriding purpose of the constitutional provision.  See,

				The express grant of a perpetual copyright would unquestionably violate the textual requirement that the authors&#x92; exclusive rights be only &#x93;for limited Times.&#x94;  Whether the extraordinary length of the grants authorized by the 1998 Act are invalid because they are the functional equivalent of perpetual copyrights is a question that need not be answered in this case because the question presented by the certiorari petition merely challenges Congress&#x92; power to extend retroactively the terms of existing copyrights.  Accordingly, there is no need to determine whether the deference that is normally given to congressional policy judgments may save from judicial review its decision respecting the appropriate length of the term.

				  It is important to note, however, that a categorical rule prohibiting retroactive extensions would effectively preclude perpetual copyrights.  More importantly, as the House of Lords recognized when it refused to amend the Statute of Anne in 1735, unless the Clause is construed to embody such a categorical rule, Congress may extend existing monopoly privileges

				By failing to protect the public interest in free access to the products of inventive and artistic genius&#x97;indeed, by virtually ignoring the central purpose of the Copyright/Patent Clause&#x97;the Court has quitclaimed to Congress its principal responsibility in this area of the law.  Fairly read, the Court has stated that Congress&#x92; actions under the Copyright/Patent Clause are, for all intents and purposes, judicially unreviewable.  That result cannot be squared with the basic tenets of our constitutional structure.  It is not hyperbole to recall the trenchant words of Chief Justice John Marshall: &#x93;It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.&#x94;

						 Justice Harlan wrote a brief concurrence, but did not disagree with this statement.  Justice Black&#x92;s statement echoed a portion of Attorney General Wirt&#x92;s argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 171 (1824): &#x93;The law of Congress declares, that all inventors of useful improvements throughout the United States, shall be entitled to the exclusive right in their discoveries for fourteen years only.  The law of New-York declares, that this inventor shall be entitled to the exclusive use of his discovery for thirty years, and as much longer as the State shall permit.  The law of Congress, by limiting the exclusive right to fourteen years, in effect declares, that after the expiration of that time, the discovery shall be the common right of the whole people of the United States.&#x94;

						Attorney General Wirt made this precise point in his argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 175: &#x93;The limitation is not for the advantage of the inventor, but of society at large, which is to take the benefit of the invention after the period of limitation has expired.  The patentee pays a duty on his patent, which is an effective source of revenue to the United States.  It is virtually a contract between each patentee and the people of the United States, by which the time of exclusive and secure enjoyment is limited, and then the benefit of the discovery results to the public.&#x94;

						The Court acknowledges that this proposition is &#x93;uncontroversial&#x94; today, see ante, at 11, n. 6, but overlooks the fact that it was highly controversial in the early 1800&#x92;s.  See n. 11, infra.  The Court assumes that the Sears holding rested entirely on the pre-emptive effect of congressional statutes even though the opinion itself, like the opinions  in Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City,

, also relied on the pre-emptive effect of the constitutional provision.  That at least some of the Framers recognized that the Constitution itself imposed a limitation even before Congress acted is demonstrated by Madison&#x92;s letter, quoted in n. 6, infra.

						 &#x93;Your idea of appropriating a district of territory to the encouragement of imported inventions is new and worthy of consideration.  I can not but apprehend however that the clause in the constitution which forbids patents for that purpose will lie equally in the way of your expedient.  Congress seem to be tied down to the single mode of encouraging inventions by granting the exclusive benefit of them for a limited time, and therefore to have no more power to give a further encouragement out of a fund of land than a fund of money.  This fetter on the National Legislature tho&#x92; an unfortunate one, was a deliberate one.  The Latitude of authority now wished for was strongly urged and expressly rejected.&#x94;  Madison&#x92;s description of the Copyright/Patent Clause as a &#x93;fetter on the National Legislature&#x94; is fully consistent with this Court&#x92;s opinion in Graham.

						 Importantly, even this first Act required a quid pro quo in order to receive federal copyright protection.  In order to receive protection under the Act, the author was first required to register the work: &#x93;That no person shall be entitled to the benefit of this act, in cases where any map, chart, book or books, hath or have been already printed and published, unless he shall first deposit, and in all other cases, unless he shall before publication deposit a printed copy of the title of such map, chart, book or books, in the clerk&#x92;s office of the district court where the author or proprietor shall reside.&#x94; &#xA7;3, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124.  This registration requirement in federal district court&#x97;a requirement obviously not required under the various state laws protecting written works&#x97;further illustrates that the 1790 Act created new rights, rather than extending existing rights.

						 Respondent&#x92;s reformulation of the questions presented by this case confuses this basic distinction.  We granted certiorari to consider the question: &#x93;Did the D. C. Circuit err in holding that Congress has the power under the Copyright Clause to extend retroactively the term of existing copyrights?&#x94;  Respondent&#x92;s reformulation of the first question presented&#x97;&#x93;Whether the 20-year extension of the terms of all unexpired copyrights . . . violates the Copyright Clause of the Constitution insofar as it applies to works in existence when it took effect&#x94;&#x97;significantly changes the substance of inquiry by changing the focus from the federal statute at issue to irrelevant common-law protections.  Brief for Respondent I.  Indeed, this reformulation violated this Court&#x92;s Rule 24(1)(a), which states that &#x93;the brief [on the merits] may not raise additional questions or change the substance of the questions already presented in&#x94; the petition for certiorari.

						 In the period before our decision in Wheaton, the pre-emptive effect of the Patent/Copyright Clause was also a matter of serious debate within the legal profession. Indeed, in their argument in this Court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 44&#x96;61, 141&#x96;157, the defenders of New York&#x92;s grant of a 30-year monopoly on the passenger trade between New Jersey and Manhattan argued that the Clause actually should be interpreted as confirming the State&#x92;s authority to grant monopoly privileges that supplemented any federal grant. That argument is, of course, flatly inconsistent with our recent unanimous decision in Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S 141 (1989).  Although Attorney General Wirt had urged the Court to endorse our present interpretation of the Clause, its implicit limitations were unsettled when the 1831 Copyright Act was passed.

						  It is true, as the majority points out, ante at 11, n. 5, that Graham did not expressly overrule those earlier cases because Graham did not address the issue whether Congress could revive expired patents. That observation does not even arguably justify reliance on a set of old circuit court cases to support a proposition that is inconsistent with our present understanding of the limits imposed by the Copyright/Patent Clause.  After all, a unanimous Court recently endorsed the precise analysis that the majority now seeks to characterize as &#x93;wishful thinking.&#x94;  Ante, at 11, n. 5.  See Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;Congress may not create patent monopolies of unlimited duration, nor may it &#x91;authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain, or to restrict free access to materials already available&#x92; &#x94; (quoting Graham, 383 U. S., at 6 )).

						 Similarly, the validity of earlier retroactive extensions of copyright protection is not at issue in this case.  To decide the question now presented, we need not consider whether the reliance and expectation interests that have been established by prior extensions passed years ago would alter the result.  Cf. Heckler v. Mathews, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/465/728" class="subref" title="subref">465 U. S. 728</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">746</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;We have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting reasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an unconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time&#x94;).  Those interests are not at issue now, because the act under review in this case was passed only four years ago and has been under challenge in court since shortly after its enactment.

				  As I shall explain, the reasons why a State may not extend the life of a patent apply to Congress as well.  If Congress may not expand the scope of a patent monopoly, it also may not extend the life of a copyright beyond its expiration date.  Accordingly, insofar as the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.
2827, purported to extend the life of unexpired copyrights, it is invalid.  Because the majority&#x92;s contrary conclusion rests on the mistaken premise that this Court has virtually no role in reviewing congressional grants of monopoly privileges to authors, inventors and their successors, I respectfully dissent.

				The authority to issue copyrights stems from the same Clause in the Constitution that created the patent power.  It provides:

If an inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention; if he should for a long period of years retain the monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure; and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to secure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under it during his fourteen years; it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful arts, and give a premium to those, who should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries.&#x94;

It would be manifestly unfair if, after issuing a patent, the Government as a representative of the public sought to modify the bargain by shortening the term of the patent in order to accelerate public access to the invention.  The fairness considerations that underlie the constitutional protections against 
				<em>
					ex post facto
				</em>
				 laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts would presumably disable Congress from making such a retroactive change in the public&#x92;s bargain with an inventor without providing compensation for the taking.  Those same considerations should protect members of the public who make plans to exploit an invention as soon as it enters the public domain from a retroactive modification of the bargain that extends the term of the patent monopoly.  As I discuss below, the few historical exceptions to this rule do not undermine the constitutional analysis.  For quite plainly, the limitations &#x93;implicit in the Patent Clause itself,&#x94; 489 U. S., at 151, adequately explain why neither a State nor Congress may &#x93;extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date,&#x94;

				Neither the purpose of encouraging new inventions nor the overriding interest in advancing progress by adding knowledge to the public domain is served by retroactively increasing the inventor&#x92;s compensation for a completed invention and frustrating the legitimate expectations of members of the public who want to make use of it in a free market.

				 extensions of copyrights result in a gratuitous transfer of wealth from the public to authors, publishers, and their successors in interest.  Such retroactive extensions do not even arguably serve either of the purposes of the Copyright/Patent Clause.  The reasons why such extensions of the patent monopoly are unconstitutional apply to copyrights as well.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent, however, advances four arguments in support of the constitutionality of such retroactive extensions: (1) the first Copyright Act enacted shortly after the Constitution was ratified applied to works that had already been produced; (2) later Congresses have repeatedly authorized extensions of copyrights and patents; (3) such extensions promote the useful arts by giving copyright holders an incentive to preserve and restore certain valuable motion pictures; and (4) as a matter of equity, whenever Congress provides a longer term as an incentive to the creation of new works by authors, it should provide an equivalent reward to the owners of all unexpired copyrights.  None of these arguments is persuasive.

Whereas H. R. 10 would have extended patent protection to only those inventions that were &#x93;not before known or used,&#x94; H.

				The final version of the 1790 Patent Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
109, did not contain the geographic qualifier and thus did not provide for patents of importation.  This statutory omission, coupled with the contemporaneous statements by legislators, provides strong evidence that Congress recognized significant limitations on their constitutional authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause to extend protection to a class of intellectual properties.  This recognition of a categorical constitutional limitation is fundamentally at odds with the majority&#x92;s reading of Article I, &#xA7;8 to provide essentially no limit on congressional action under the Clause.  If early congressional practice does, indeed, inform our analysis, as it should, then the majority&#x92;s judicial excision of these constitutional limits cannot be correct.

				Congress also passed the first Copyright Act,

124, in 1790.  At that time there were a number of maps, charts, and books that had already been printed, some of which were copyrighted under state laws and some of which were arguably entitled to perpetual protection under the common law.  The federal statute applied to those works as well as to new works.  In some cases the application of the new federal rule reduced the pre-existing protections, and in others it may have increased the protection.  What is significant is that the statute provided a general rule creating new federal rights that supplanted the diverse state rights that previously existed.  It did not extend or attach to any of those pre-existing state and common-law rights: &#x93;That congress, in passing the act of 1790, did not legislate in reference to existing rights, appears clear.&#x94;  Wheaton

				Moreover, members of Congress in 1790 were well aware of the distinction between the creation of new copyright regimes and the extension of existing copyrights.  The 1790 Act was patterned, in many ways, after the Statute of Anne enacted in England in 1710.  8 Ann., c. 19; see

.  The English statute, in addition to providing authors with copyrights on new works for a term of 14 years renewable for another 14-year term, also replaced the booksellers&#x92; claimed perpetual rights in existing works with a single 21-year term.  In 1735, the booksellers proposed an amendment that would have extended the terms of existing copyrights until 1756, but the amendment was defeated.  Opponents of the amendment had argued that if the bill were to pass, it would &#x93;in Effect be establishing a perpetual Monopoly &#x2026; only to increase the private Gain of the Booksellers &#x2026; .&#x94;

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70, demonstrates the pitfalls of relying on an incomplete historical analysis.  Evans, an inventor who had developed several improvements in milling flour, received the third federal patent on January 7, 1791.  See Federico, Patent Trials of Oliver Evans, 27 J. Pat. Off. Soc. 586, 590 (1945).  Under the 14-year term provided by the 1790 Patent Act, this patent was to expire on January 7, 1805.  Claiming that 14 years had not provided him a sufficient time to realize income from his invention and that the net profits were spent developing improvements on the steam engine, Evans first sought an extension of his patent in December 1804.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 598; 14 Annals of Congress 1002.  Unsuccessful in 1804, he tried again in 1805, and yet again in 1806, to persuade Congress to pass his private bill.  Undaunted, Evans tried one last time to revive his expired patent after receiving an adverse judgment in an infringement action.  See 
				<em>

				v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 8 F. Cas. 837 (No. 4,555) (CC Pa. 1807).  This time, his effort at private legislation was successful and Congress passed a bill extending his patent for 14 years.  See An Act for the relief of Oliver Evans, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70.  This legislation, passed January 21, 1808, restored a patent monopoly for an invention that had been in the public domain for over four years.  As such, this Act unquestionably exceeded Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause: &#x93;The Congress in the exercise of the patent power may not overreach the restraints imposed by the stated constitutional purpose. &#x2026;

				Copyright legislation has a similar history.  The federal Copyright Act was first amended in 1831. That amendment, like later amendments, not only authorized a longer term for new works, but also extended the terms of unexpired copyrights.

				It would be particularly unwise to attach constitutional significance to the 1831 amendment because of the very different legal landscape against which it was enacted.  Congress based its authority to pass the amendment on grounds shortly thereafter declared improper by the Court.

				The majority&#x92;s reliance on the other patent case it cites is similarly misplaced.  Contrary to the suggestion in the Court&#x92;s opinion, 
				<em>

				</em>
				v. 
				<em>

				, at 10&#x96;11. The question in that case was whether the former employer of the inventor, one James Harley, could be held liable as an infringer for continuing to use the process that Harley had invented in 1834 when he was in its employ.  The Court first held that the employer&#x92;s use of the process before the patent issued was not a public use that would invalidate the patent, even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.  1 How., at 206&#x96;208.  The Court then disposed of the case on the ground that a statute enacted in 1839 protected the alleged infringer&#x92;s right to continue to use the process after the patent issued.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 209&#x96;211.  Our opinion said nothing about the power of Congress to extend the life of an issued patent.  It did note that Congress has plenary power to legislate on the subject of patents provided &#x93;that they do not take away the rights of property in existing patents.&#x94;  
				<em>

				</em>
				at 206.  The fact that Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee is, of course, fully consistent with the view that it cannot enlarge the patent monopoly to the detriment of the public after a patent has issued.

				The history of retroactive extensions of existing and expired copyrights and patents, though relevant, is not conclusive of the constitutionality of the Sonny Bono Act.  The fact that the Court has not previously passed upon the constitutionality of retroactive copyright extensions does not insulate the present extension from constitutional challenge.

				Respondent also argues that the Act promotes the useful arts by providing incentives to restore old movies.  For at least three reasons, the interest in preserving perishable copies of old copyrighted films does not justify a wholesale extension of existing copyrights.  First, such restoration and preservation will not even arguably promote any new works by authors or inventors.  And, of course, any original expression in the restoration and preservation of movies will receive new copyright protection.

            </a>
				  Second, however strong the justification for preserving such works may be, that justification applies equally to works whose copyrights have already expired.  Yet no one seriously contends that the Copyright/Patent Clause would authorize the grant of monopoly privileges for works already in the public domain solely to encourage their restoration.  Finally, even if this concern with aging movies would permit congressional protection, the remedy offered&#x97;a blanket extension of all copyrights&#x97;simply bears no relationship to the alleged harm.

				Finally, respondent relies on concerns of equity to justify the retroactive extension.  If Congress concludes that a longer period of exclusivity is necessary in order to provide an adequate incentive to authors to produce new works, respondent seems to believe that simple fairness requires that the same lengthened period be provided to authors whose works have already been completed and copyrighted.  This is a classic non sequitur.  The reason for increasing the inducement to create something new simply does not apply to an already-created work.  To the contrary, the equity argument actually provides strong support for petitioners.  Members of the public were entitled to rely on a promised access to copyrighted or patented works at the expiration of the terms specified when the exclusive privileges were granted.  On the other hand, authors will receive the full benefit of the exclusive terms that were promised as an inducement to their creativity, and have no equitable claim to increased compensation for doing nothing more.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				One must indulge in two untenable assumptions to find support in the equitable argument offered by respondent&#x97;that the public interest in free access to copyrighted works is entirely worthless and that authors, as a class, should receive a windfall solely based on completed creative activity.  Indeed, Congress has apparently indulged in those assumptions for under the series of extensions to copyrights, only one year&#x92;s worth of creative work&#x97;that copyrighted in 1923&#x97;has fallen into the public domain during the last 80 years.  But as our cases repeatedly and consistently emphasize, ultimate public access is the overriding purpose of the constitutional provision.  See,

				The express grant of a perpetual copyright would unquestionably violate the textual requirement that the authors&#x92; exclusive rights be only &#x93;for limited Times.&#x94;  Whether the extraordinary length of the grants authorized by the 1998 Act are invalid because they are the functional equivalent of perpetual copyrights is a question that need not be answered in this case because the question presented by the certiorari petition merely challenges Congress&#x92; power to extend retroactively the terms of existing copyrights.  Accordingly, there is no need to determine whether the deference that is normally given to congressional policy judgments may save from judicial review its decision respecting the appropriate length of the term.

				  It is important to note, however, that a categorical rule prohibiting retroactive extensions would effectively preclude perpetual copyrights.

				By failing to protect the public interest in free access to the products of inventive and artistic genius&#x97;indeed, by virtually ignoring the central purpose of the Copyright/Patent Clause&#x97;the Court has quitclaimed to Congress its principal responsibility in this area of the law.  Fairly read, the Court has stated that Congress&#x92; actions under the Copyright/Patent Clause are, for all intents and purposes, judicially unreviewable.  That result cannot be squared with the basic tenets of our constitutional structure.  It is not hyperbole to recall the trenchant words of Chief Justice John Marshall: &#x93;It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.&#x94;

						 Justice Harlan wrote a brief concurrence, but did not disagree with this statement.  Justice Black&#x92;s statement echoed a portion of Attorney General Wirt&#x92;s argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 171 (1824): &#x93;The law of Congress declares, that all inventors of useful improvements throughout the United States, shall be entitled to the exclusive right in their discoveries for fourteen years only.  The law of New-York declares, that this inventor shall be entitled to the exclusive use of his discovery for thirty years, and as much longer as the State shall permit.  The law of Congress, by limiting the exclusive right to fourteen years, in effect declares, that after the expiration of that time, the discovery shall be the common right of the whole people of the United States.&#x94;

						Attorney General Wirt made this precise point in his argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 175: &#x93;The limitation is not for the advantage of the inventor, but of society at large, which is to take the benefit of the invention after the period of limitation has expired.  The patentee pays a duty on his patent, which is an effective source of revenue to the United States.  It is virtually a contract between each patentee and the people of the United States, by which the time of exclusive and secure enjoyment is limited, and then the benefit of the discovery results to the public.&#x94;

						The Court acknowledges that this proposition is &#x93;uncontroversial&#x94; today, see ante, at 11, n. 6, but overlooks the fact that it was highly controversial in the early 1800&#x92;s.  See n. 11, infra.  The Court assumes that the Sears holding rested entirely on the pre-emptive effect of congressional statutes even though the opinion itself, like the opinions  in Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City,

						 &#x93;Your idea of appropriating a district of territory to the encouragement of imported inventions is new and worthy of consideration.  I can not but apprehend however that the clause in the constitution which forbids patents for that purpose will lie equally in the way of your expedient.  Congress seem to be tied down to the single mode of encouraging inventions by granting the exclusive benefit of them for a limited time, and therefore to have no more power to give a further encouragement out of a fund of land than a fund of money.  This fetter on the National Legislature tho&#x92; an unfortunate one, was a deliberate one.  The Latitude of authority now wished for was strongly urged and expressly rejected.&#x94;  Madison&#x92;s description of the Copyright/Patent Clause as a &#x93;fetter on the National Legislature&#x94; is fully consistent with this Court&#x92;s opinion in Graham.

						 Importantly, even this first Act required a quid pro quo in order to receive federal copyright protection.  In order to receive protection under the Act, the author was first required to register the work: &#x93;That no person shall be entitled to the benefit of this act, in cases where any map, chart, book or books, hath or have been already printed and published, unless he shall first deposit, and in all other cases, unless he shall before publication deposit a printed copy of the title of such map, chart, book or books, in the clerk&#x92;s office of the district court where the author or proprietor shall reside.&#x94; &#xA7;3, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124.  This registration requirement in federal district court&#x97;a requirement obviously not required under the various state laws protecting written works&#x97;further illustrates that the 1790 Act created new rights, rather than extending existing rights.

						 Respondent&#x92;s reformulation of the questions presented by this case confuses this basic distinction.  We granted certiorari to consider the question: &#x93;Did the D. C.

						 In the period before our decision in Wheaton, the pre-emptive effect of the Patent/Copyright Clause was also a matter of serious debate within the legal profession. Indeed, in their argument in this Court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 44&#x96;61, 141&#x96;157, the defenders of New York&#x92;s grant of a 30-year monopoly on the passenger trade between New Jersey and Manhattan argued that the Clause actually should be interpreted as confirming the State&#x92;s authority to grant monopoly privileges that supplemented any federal grant. That argument is, of course, flatly inconsistent with our recent unanimous decision in Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S 141 (1989).  Although Attorney General Wirt had urged the Court to endorse our present interpretation of the Clause, its implicit limitations were unsettled when the 1831 Copyright Act was passed.

						  It is true, as the majority points out, ante at 11, n. 5, that Graham did not expressly overrule those earlier cases because Graham did not address the issue whether Congress could revive expired patents. That observation does not even arguably justify reliance on a set of old circuit court cases to support a proposition that is inconsistent with our present understanding of the limits imposed by the Copyright/Patent Clause.  After all, a unanimous Court recently endorsed the precise analysis that the majority now seeks to characterize as &#x93;wishful thinking.&#x94;  Ante, at 11, n. 5.  See Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;Congress may not create patent monopolies of unlimited duration, nor may it &#x91;authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain, or to restrict free access to materials already available&#x92; &#x94; (quoting Graham, 383 U.

						 Similarly, the validity of earlier retroactive extensions of copyright protection is not at issue in this case.  To decide the question now presented, we need not consider whether the reliance and expectation interests that have been established by prior extensions passed years ago would alter the result.  Cf. Heckler v. Mathews, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/465/728" class="subref" title="subref">465 U. S. 728</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">746</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;We have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting reasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an unconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time&#x94;).  Those interests are not at issue now, because the act under review in this case was passed only four years ago and has been under challenge in court since shortly after its enactment.

				  As I shall explain, the reasons why a State may not extend the life of a patent apply to Congress as well.  If Congress may not expand the scope of a patent monopoly, it also may not extend the life of a copyright beyond its expiration date.  Accordingly, insofar as the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.
2827, purported to extend the life of unexpired copyrights, it is invalid.  Because the majority&#x92;s contrary conclusion rests on the mistaken premise that this Court has virtually no role in reviewing congressional grants of monopoly privileges to authors, inventors and their successors, I respectfully dissent.

				The authority to issue copyrights stems from the same Clause in the Constitution that created the patent power.  It provides:

If an inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention; if he should for a long period of years retain the monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure; and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to secure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under it during his fourteen years; it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful arts, and give a premium to those, who should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries.&#x94;

 (&#x93;[T]he patent system represents a carefully crafted bargain that encourages both the creation and the public disclosure of new and useful advances in technology, in return for an exclusive monopoly for a limited period of time&#x94;).  It would be manifestly unfair if, after issuing a patent, the Government as a representative of the public sought to modify the bargain by shortening the term of the patent in order to accelerate public access to the invention.  The fairness considerations that underlie the constitutional protections against 
				<em>

				 laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts would presumably disable Congress from making such a retroactive change in the public&#x92;s bargain with an inventor without providing compensation for the taking.  Those same considerations should protect members of the public who make plans to exploit an invention as soon as it enters the public domain from a retroactive modification of the bargain that extends the term of the patent monopoly.  As I discuss below, the few historical exceptions to this rule do not undermine the constitutional analysis.  For quite plainly, the limitations &#x93;implicit in the Patent Clause itself,&#x94; 489 U.

				 extensions of copyrights result in a gratuitous transfer of wealth from the public to authors, publishers, and their successors in interest.  Such retroactive extensions do not even arguably serve either of the purposes of the Copyright/Patent Clause.  The reasons why such extensions of the patent monopoly are unconstitutional apply to copyrights as well.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent, however, advances four arguments in support of the constitutionality of such retroactive extensions: (1) the first Copyright Act enacted shortly after the Constitution was ratified applied to works that had already been produced; (2) later Congresses have repeatedly authorized extensions of copyrights and patents; (3) such extensions promote the useful arts by giving copyright holders an incentive to preserve and restore certain valuable motion pictures; and (4) as a matter of equity, whenever Congress provides a longer term as an incentive to the creation of new works by authors, it should provide an equivalent reward to the owners of all unexpired copyrights.  None of these arguments is persuasive.

Whereas H. R. 10 would have extended patent protection to only those inventions that were &#x93;not before known or used,&#x94; H.

				The final version of the 1790 Patent Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
109, did not contain the geographic qualifier and thus did not provide for patents of importation.  This statutory omission, coupled with the contemporaneous statements by legislators, provides strong evidence that Congress recognized significant limitations on their constitutional authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause to extend protection to a class of intellectual properties.  This recognition of a categorical constitutional limitation is fundamentally at odds with the majority&#x92;s reading of Article I, &#xA7;8 to provide essentially no limit on congressional action under the Clause.  If early congressional practice does, indeed, inform our analysis, as it should, then the majority&#x92;s judicial excision of these constitutional limits cannot be correct.

				Congress also passed the first Copyright Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124, in 1790.  At that time there were a number of maps, charts, and books that had already been printed, some of which were copyrighted under state laws and some of which were arguably entitled to perpetual protection under the common law.  The federal statute applied to those works as well as to new works.  In some cases the application of the new federal rule reduced the pre-existing protections, and in others it may have increased the protection.  What is significant is that the statute provided a general rule creating new federal rights that supplanted the diverse state rights that previously existed.  It did not extend or attach to any of those pre-existing state and common-law rights: &#x93;That congress, in passing the act of 1790, did not legislate in reference to existing rights, appears clear.&#x94;  Wheaton

 (&#x93;As this Court has repeatedly said, the Congress did not sanction an existing right but created a new one&#x94;).

				Moreover, members of Congress in 1790 were well aware of the distinction between the creation of new copyright regimes and the extension of existing copyrights.  The 1790 Act was patterned, in many ways, after the Statute of Anne enacted in England in 1710.  8 Ann., c. 19; see

.  The English statute, in addition to providing authors with copyrights on new works for a term of 14 years renewable for another 14-year term, also replaced the booksellers&#x92; claimed perpetual rights in existing works with a single 21-year term.  In 1735, the booksellers proposed an amendment that would have extended the terms of existing copyrights until 1756, but the amendment was defeated.  Opponents of the amendment had argued that if the bill were to pass, it would &#x93;in Effect be establishing a perpetual Monopoly &#x2026; only to increase the private Gain of the Booksellers &#x2026; .&#x94;

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70, demonstrates the pitfalls of relying on an incomplete historical analysis.  Evans, an inventor who had developed several improvements in milling flour, received the third federal patent on January 7, 1791.  See Federico, Patent Trials of Oliver Evans, 27 J. Pat. Off. Soc. 586, 590 (1945).  Under the 14-year term provided by the 1790 Patent Act, this patent was to expire on January 7, 1805.  Claiming that 14 years had not provided him a sufficient time to realize income from his invention and that the net profits were spent developing improvements on the steam engine, Evans first sought an extension of his patent in December 1804.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 598; 14 Annals of Congress 1002.  Unsuccessful in 1804, he tried again in 1805, and yet again in 1806, to persuade Congress to pass his private bill.  Undaunted, Evans tried one last time to revive his expired patent after receiving an adverse judgment in an infringement action.  See 
				<em>
					Evans 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 8 F. Cas. 837 (No. 4,555) (CC Pa. 1807).  This time, his effort at private legislation was successful and Congress passed a bill extending his patent for 14 years.  See An Act for the relief of Oliver Evans, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70.  This legislation, passed January 21, 1808, restored a patent monopoly for an invention that had been in the public domain for over four years.  As such, this Act unquestionably exceeded Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause: &#x93;The Congress in the exercise of the patent power may not overreach the restraints imposed by the stated constitutional purpose. &#x2026;

				Copyright legislation has a similar history.  The federal Copyright Act was first amended in 1831. That amendment, like later amendments, not only authorized a longer term for new works, but also extended the terms of unexpired copyrights.

				It would be particularly unwise to attach constitutional significance to the 1831 amendment because of the very different legal landscape against which it was enacted.  Congress based its authority to pass the amendment on grounds shortly thereafter declared improper by the Court.  The Judiciary Committee Report prepared for the House of Representatives asserted that &#x93;an author has an exclusive and perpetual right, in preference to any other, to the fruits of his labor.&#x94;  7 Gales &amp; Seaton, Register of Debates in Congress cxx (1831).

				In 1861, Congress amended the term of patents, from a 14-year term plus opportunity for 7-year extension to a flat 17 years with no extension permitted.  Act of Mar. 2, 1861, ch. 88, &#xA7;16,

				  To be sure, Congress, at many times in its history, has retroactively extended the terms of existing copyrights and patents.  This history, however, reveals a much more heterogeneous practice than respondent contends.  It is replete with actions that were unquestionably unconstitutional.  Though relevant, the history is not dispositive of the constitutionality of Sonny Bono Act.

				The general presumption that historic practice illuminates the constitutionality of congressional action is not controlling in this case.  That presumption is strongest when the earliest acts of Congress are considered, for the overlap of identity between those who created the Constitution and those who first constituted Congress provides &#x93;contemporaneous and weighty evidence&#x94; of the Constitution&#x92;s &#x93;true meaning.&#x94;

				The majority&#x92;s reliance on the other patent case it cites is similarly misplaced.  Contrary to the suggestion in the Court&#x92;s opinion, 
				<em>
					McClurg 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>

				1 How. 202 (1843), did not involve the &#x93;legislative expansion&#x94; of an existing patent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10&#x96;11. The question in that case was whether the former employer of the inventor, one James Harley, could be held liable as an infringer for continuing to use the process that Harley had invented in 1834 when he was in its employ.  The Court first held that the employer&#x92;s use of the process before the patent issued was not a public use that would invalidate the patent, even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.  1 How., at 206&#x96;208.  The Court then disposed of the case on the ground that a statute enacted in 1839 protected the alleged infringer&#x92;s right to continue to use the process after the patent issued.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 209&#x96;211.  Our opinion said nothing about the power of Congress to extend the life of an issued patent.  It did note that Congress has plenary power to legislate on the subject of patents provided &#x93;that they do not take away the rights of property in existing patents.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 206.  The fact that Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee is, of course, fully consistent with the view that it cannot enlarge the patent monopoly to the detriment of the public after a patent has issued.

				The history of retroactive extensions of existing and expired copyrights and patents, though relevant, is not conclusive of the constitutionality of the Sonny Bono Act.

				Respondent also argues that the Act promotes the useful arts by providing incentives to restore old movies.  For at least three reasons, the interest in preserving perishable copies of old copyrighted films does not justify a wholesale extension of existing copyrights.  First, such restoration and preservation will not even arguably promote any new works by authors or inventors.  And, of course, any original expression in the restoration and preservation of movies will receive new copyright protection.

            </a>
				  Second, however strong the justification for preserving such works may be, that justification applies equally to works whose copyrights have already expired.  Yet no one seriously contends that the Copyright/Patent Clause would authorize the grant of monopoly privileges for works already in the public domain solely to encourage their restoration.  Finally, even if this concern with aging movies would permit congressional protection, the remedy offered&#x97;a blanket extension of all copyrights&#x97;simply bears no relationship to the alleged harm.

        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Finally, respondent relies on concerns of equity to justify the retroactive extension.  If Congress concludes that a longer period of exclusivity is necessary in order to provide an adequate incentive to authors to produce new works, respondent seems to believe that simple fairness requires that the same lengthened period be provided to authors whose works have already been completed and copyrighted.  This is a classic non sequitur.  The reason for increasing the inducement to create something new simply does not apply to an already-created work.  To the contrary, the equity argument actually provides strong support for petitioners.  Members of the public were entitled to rely on a promised access to copyrighted or patented works at the expiration of the terms specified when the exclusive privileges were granted.  On the other hand, authors will receive the full benefit of the exclusive terms that were promised as an inducement to their creativity, and have no equitable claim to increased compensation for doing nothing more.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				One must indulge in two untenable assumptions to find support in the equitable argument offered by respondent&#x97;that the public interest in free access to copyrighted works is entirely worthless and that authors, as a class, should receive a windfall solely based on completed creative activity.  Indeed, Congress has apparently indulged in those assumptions for under the series of extensions to copyrights, only one year&#x92;s worth of creative work&#x97;that copyrighted in 1923&#x97;has fallen into the public domain during the last 80 years.  But as our cases repeatedly and consistently emphasize, ultimate public access is the overriding purpose of the constitutional provision.  See,

				The express grant of a perpetual copyright would unquestionably violate the textual requirement that the authors&#x92; exclusive rights be only &#x93;for limited Times.&#x94;  Whether the extraordinary length of the grants authorized by the 1998 Act are invalid because they are the functional equivalent of perpetual copyrights is a question that need not be answered in this case because the question presented by the certiorari petition merely challenges Congress&#x92; power to extend retroactively the terms of existing copyrights.  Accordingly, there is no need to determine whether the deference that is normally given to congressional policy judgments may save from judicial review its decision respecting the appropriate length of the term.

				  It is important to note, however, that a categorical rule prohibiting retroactive extensions would effectively preclude perpetual copyrights.  More importantly, as the House of Lords recognized when it refused to amend the Statute of Anne in 1735, unless the Clause is construed to embody such a categorical rule, Congress may extend existing monopoly privileges

				By failing to protect the public interest in free access to the products of inventive and artistic genius&#x97;indeed, by virtually ignoring the central purpose of the Copyright/Patent Clause&#x97;the Court has quitclaimed to Congress its principal responsibility in this area of the law.  Fairly read, the Court has stated that Congress&#x92; actions under the Copyright/Patent Clause are, for all intents and purposes, judicially unreviewable.  That result cannot be squared with the basic tenets of our constitutional structure.

						 Justice Harlan wrote a brief concurrence, but did not disagree with this statement.  Justice Black&#x92;s statement echoed a portion of Attorney General Wirt&#x92;s argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 171 (1824): &#x93;The law of Congress declares, that all inventors of useful improvements throughout the United States, shall be entitled to the exclusive right in their discoveries for fourteen years only.  The law of New-York declares, that this inventor shall be entitled to the exclusive use of his discovery for thirty years, and as much longer as the State shall permit.  The law of Congress, by limiting the exclusive right to fourteen years, in effect declares, that after the expiration of that time, the discovery shall be the common right of the whole people of the United States.&#x94;

						Attorney General Wirt made this precise point in his argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 175: &#x93;The limitation is not for the advantage of the inventor, but of society at large, which is to take the benefit of the invention after the period of limitation has expired.  The patentee pays a duty on his patent, which is an effective source of revenue to the United States.  It is virtually a contract between each patentee and the people of the United States, by which the time of exclusive and secure enjoyment is limited, and then the benefit of the discovery results to the public.&#x94;

						The Court acknowledges that this proposition is &#x93;uncontroversial&#x94; today, see ante, at 11, n. 6, but overlooks the fact that it was highly controversial in the early 1800&#x92;s.  See n. 11, infra.  The Court assumes that the Sears holding rested entirely on the pre-emptive effect of congressional statutes even though the opinion itself, like the opinions  in Graham v.

						 &#x93;Your idea of appropriating a district of territory to the encouragement of imported inventions is new and worthy of consideration.  I can not but apprehend however that the clause in the constitution which forbids patents for that purpose will lie equally in the way of your expedient.  Congress seem to be tied down to the single mode of encouraging inventions by granting the exclusive benefit of them for a limited time, and therefore to have no more power to give a further encouragement out of a fund of land than a fund of money.  This fetter on the National Legislature tho&#x92; an unfortunate one, was a deliberate one.  The Latitude of authority now wished for was strongly urged and expressly rejected.&#x94;  Madison&#x92;s description of the Copyright/Patent Clause as a &#x93;fetter on the National Legislature&#x94; is fully consistent with this Court&#x92;s opinion in Graham.

						 Importantly, even this first Act required a quid pro quo in order to receive federal copyright protection.  In order to receive protection under the Act, the author was first required to register the work: &#x93;That no person shall be entitled to the benefit of this act, in cases where any map, chart, book or books, hath or have been already printed and published, unless he shall first deposit, and in all other cases, unless he shall before publication deposit a printed copy of the title of such map, chart, book or books, in the clerk&#x92;s office of the district court where the author or proprietor shall reside.&#x94; &#xA7;3,

						 In the period before our decision in Wheaton, the pre-emptive effect of the Patent/Copyright Clause was also a matter of serious debate within the legal profession. Indeed, in their argument in this Court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 44&#x96;61, 141&#x96;157, the defenders of New York&#x92;s grant of a 30-year monopoly on the passenger trade between New Jersey and Manhattan argued that the Clause actually should be interpreted as confirming the State&#x92;s authority to grant monopoly privileges that supplemented any federal grant. That argument is, of course, flatly inconsistent with our recent unanimous decision in Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S 141 (1989).  Although Attorney General Wirt had urged the Court to endorse our present interpretation of the Clause, its implicit limitations were unsettled when the 1831 Copyright Act was passed.

						  It is true, as the majority points out, ante at 11, n. 5, that Graham did not expressly overrule those earlier cases because Graham did not address the issue whether Congress could revive expired patents. That observation does not even arguably justify reliance on a set of old circuit court cases to support a proposition that is inconsistent with our present understanding of the limits imposed by the Copyright/Patent Clause.  After all, a unanimous Court recently endorsed the precise analysis that the majority now seeks to characterize as &#x93;wishful thinking.&#x94;  Ante, at 11, n. 5.  See Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;Congress may not create patent monopolies of unlimited duration, nor may it &#x91;authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain, or to restrict free access to materials already available&#x92; &#x94; (quoting Graham, 383 U.

						 Similarly, the validity of earlier retroactive extensions of copyright protection is not at issue in this case.  To decide the question now presented, we need not consider whether the reliance and expectation interests that have been established by prior extensions passed years ago would alter the result.  Cf. Heckler v. Mathews, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/465/728" class="subref" title="subref">465 U. S. 728</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">746</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;We have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting reasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an unconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time&#x94;).  Those interests are not at issue now, because the act under review in this case was passed only four years ago and has been under challenge in court since shortly after its enactment.

				  As I shall explain, the reasons why a State may not extend the life of a patent apply to Congress as well.  If Congress may not expand the scope of a patent monopoly, it also may not extend the life of a copyright beyond its expiration date.  Accordingly, insofar as the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.
2827, purported to extend the life of unexpired copyrights, it is invalid.  Because the majority&#x92;s contrary conclusion rests on the mistaken premise that this Court has virtually no role in reviewing congressional grants of monopoly privileges to authors, inventors and their successors, I respectfully dissent.

If an inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention; if he should for a long period of years retain the monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure; and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to secure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under it during his fourteen years; it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful arts, and give a premium to those, who should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries.&#x94;

 (&#x93;[T]he patent system represents a carefully crafted bargain that encourages both the creation and the public disclosure of new and useful advances in technology, in return for an exclusive monopoly for a limited period of time&#x94;).  It would be manifestly unfair if, after issuing a patent, the Government as a representative of the public sought to modify the bargain by shortening the term of the patent in order to accelerate public access to the invention.  The fairness considerations that underlie the constitutional protections against 
				<em>
					ex post facto
				</em>
				 laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts would presumably disable Congress from making such a retroactive change in the public&#x92;s bargain with an inventor without providing compensation for the taking.  Those same considerations should protect members of the public who make plans to exploit an invention as soon as it enters the public domain from a retroactive modification of the bargain that extends the term of the patent monopoly.  As I discuss below, the few historical exceptions to this rule do not undermine the constitutional analysis.  For quite plainly, the limitations &#x93;implicit in the Patent Clause itself,&#x94; 489 U. S., at 151, adequately explain why neither a State nor Congress may &#x93;extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date,&#x94;

				 extensions of copyrights result in a gratuitous transfer of wealth from the public to authors, publishers, and their successors in interest.  Such retroactive extensions do not even arguably serve either of the purposes of the Copyright/Patent Clause.  The reasons why such extensions of the patent monopoly are unconstitutional apply to copyrights as well.

				Respondent, however, advances four arguments in support of the constitutionality of such retroactive extensions: (1) the first Copyright Act enacted shortly after the Constitution was ratified applied to works that had already been produced; (2) later Congresses have repeatedly authorized extensions of copyrights and patents; (3) such extensions promote the useful arts by giving copyright holders an incentive to preserve and restore certain valuable motion pictures; and (4) as a matter of equity, whenever Congress provides a longer term as an incentive to the creation of new works by authors, it should provide an equivalent reward to the owners of all unexpired copyrights.  None of these arguments is persuasive.

This statutory omission, coupled with the contemporaneous statements by legislators, provides strong evidence that Congress recognized significant limitations on their constitutional authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause to extend protection to a class of intellectual properties.  This recognition of a categorical constitutional limitation is fundamentally at odds with the majority&#x92;s reading of Article I, &#xA7;8 to provide essentially no limit on congressional action under the Clause.

				Congress also passed the first Copyright Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124, in 1790.  At that time there were a number of maps, charts, and books that had already been printed, some of which were copyrighted under state laws and some of which were arguably entitled to perpetual protection under the common law.  The federal statute applied to those works as well as to new works.  In some cases the application of the new federal rule reduced the pre-existing protections, and in others it may have increased the protection.  What is significant is that the statute provided a general rule creating new federal rights that supplanted the diverse state rights that previously existed.  It did not extend or attach to any of those pre-existing state and common-law rights: &#x93;That congress, in passing the act of 1790, did not legislate in reference to existing rights, appears clear.&#x94;  Wheaton

 (&#x93;As this Court has repeatedly said, the Congress did not sanction an existing right but created a new one&#x94;).  Congress set in place a federal structure governing certain types of intellectual property for the new Republic.  That Congress exercised its unquestionable constitutional authority to

				  Precisely put, the question presented by this case does not even implicate the 1790 Act, for that Act created, rather than extended, copyright protection.

				Moreover, members of Congress in 1790 were well aware of the distinction between the creation of new copyright regimes and the extension of existing copyrights.  The 1790 Act was patterned, in many ways, after the Statute of Anne enacted in England in 1710.  8 Ann., c. 19; see

.  The English statute, in addition to providing authors with copyrights on new works for a term of 14 years renewable for another 14-year term, also replaced the booksellers&#x92; claimed perpetual rights in existing works with a single 21-year term.

				Since the creation of federal patent and copyright protection in 1790, Congress has passed a variety of legislation, both providing specific relief for individual authors and inventors as well as changing the general statutes conferring patent and copyright privileges.  Some of the changes did indeed, as the majority describes, extend existing protections retroactively.  Other changes, however, did not do so.  A more complete and comprehensive look at the history of congressional action under the

				The first example relied upon by respondent, the extension of Oliver Evans&#x92; patent in 1808, ch. 8, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70, demonstrates the pitfalls of relying on an incomplete historical analysis.  Evans, an inventor who had developed several improvements in milling flour, received the third federal patent on January 7, 1791.  See Federico, Patent Trials of Oliver Evans, 27 J. Pat. Off. Soc. 586, 590 (1945).  Under the 14-year term provided by the 1790 Patent Act, this patent was to expire on January 7, 1805.  Claiming that 14 years had not provided him a sufficient time to realize income from his invention and that the net profits were spent developing improvements on the steam engine, Evans first sought an extension of his patent in December 1804.  
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 598; 14 Annals of Congress 1002.  Unsuccessful in 1804, he tried again in 1805, and yet again in 1806, to persuade Congress to pass his private bill.  Undaunted, Evans tried one last time to revive his expired patent after receiving an adverse judgment in an infringement action.  See

				v. 
				<em>

				, 8 F. Cas. 837 (No. 4,555) (CC Pa. 1807).  This time, his effort at private legislation was successful and Congress passed a bill extending his patent for 14 years.  See An Act for the relief of Oliver Evans, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70.  This legislation, passed January 21, 1808, restored a patent monopoly for an invention that had been in the public domain for over four years.  As such, this Act unquestionably exceeded Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause: &#x93;The Congress in the exercise of the patent power may not overreach the restraints imposed by the stated constitutional purpose. &#x2026;

				This extension of patent protection to an expired patent was not an isolated incident.  Congress passed private bills either directly extending patents or allowing otherwise untimely applicants to apply for patent extensions for approximately 75 patents between 1790 and 1875.  Of these 75 patents, at least 56 had already fallen into the public domain.

				Copyright legislation has a similar history.  The federal Copyright Act was first amended in 1831. That amendment, like later amendments, not only authorized a longer term for new works, but also extended the terms of unexpired copyrights.  Respondent argues that that historical practice effectively establishes the constitutionality of retroactive extensions of unexpired copyrights.  Of course, the practice buttressess the presumption of validity that attaches to every Act of Congress.  But, as our decision in

				It would be particularly unwise to attach constitutional significance to the 1831 amendment because of the very different legal landscape against which it was enacted.  Congress based its authority to pass the amendment on grounds shortly thereafter declared improper by the Court.  The Judiciary Committee Report prepared for the House of Representatives asserted that &#x93;an author has an exclusive and perpetual right, in preference to any other, to the fruits of his labor.&#x94;  7 Gales &amp; Seaton, Register of Debates in Congress cxx (1831).

				In 1861, Congress amended the term of patents, from a 14-year term plus opportunity for 7-year extension to a flat 17 years with no extension permitted.  Act of Mar. 2, 1861, ch. 88, &#xA7;16,

				  To be sure, Congress, at many times in its history, has retroactively extended the terms of existing copyrights and patents.

				The general presumption that historic practice illuminates the constitutionality of congressional action is not controlling in this case.  That presumption is strongest when the earliest acts of Congress are considered, for the overlap of identity between those who created the Constitution and those who first constituted Congress provides &#x93;contemporaneous and weighty evidence&#x94; of the Constitution&#x92;s &#x93;true meaning.&#x94;

				The majority&#x92;s reliance on the other patent case it cites is similarly misplaced.  Contrary to the suggestion in the Court&#x92;s opinion, 
				<em>
					McClurg 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Kingsland, 
				</em>
				1 How. 202 (1843), did not involve the &#x93;legislative expansion&#x94; of an existing patent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10&#x96;11. The question in that case was whether the former employer of the inventor, one James Harley, could be held liable as an infringer for continuing to use the process that Harley had invented in 1834 when he was in its employ.  The Court first held that the employer&#x92;s use of the process before the patent issued was not a public use that would invalidate the patent, even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.  1 How., at 206&#x96;208.  The Court then disposed of the case on the ground that a statute enacted in 1839 protected the alleged infringer&#x92;s right to continue to use the process after the patent issued.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 209&#x96;211.  Our opinion said nothing about the power of Congress to extend the life of an issued patent.  It did note that Congress has plenary power to legislate on the subject of patents provided &#x93;that they do not take away the rights of property in existing patents.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 206.  The fact that Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee is, of course, fully consistent with the view that it cannot enlarge the patent monopoly to the detriment of the public after a patent has issued.

				Respondent also argues that the Act promotes the useful arts by providing incentives to restore old movies.  For at least three reasons, the interest in preserving perishable copies of old copyrighted films does not justify a wholesale extension of existing copyrights.  First, such restoration and preservation will not even arguably promote any new works by authors or inventors.  And, of course, any original expression in the restoration and preservation of movies will receive new copyright protection.

            </a>
				  Second, however strong the justification for preserving such works may be, that justification applies equally to works whose copyrights have already expired.  Yet no one seriously contends that the Copyright/Patent Clause would authorize the grant of monopoly privileges for works already in the public domain solely to encourage their restoration.  Finally, even if this concern with aging movies would permit congressional protection, the remedy offered&#x97;a blanket extension of all copyrights&#x97;simply bears no relationship to the alleged harm.

        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Finally, respondent relies on concerns of equity to justify the retroactive extension.  If Congress concludes that a longer period of exclusivity is necessary in order to provide an adequate incentive to authors to produce new works, respondent seems to believe that simple fairness requires that the same lengthened period be provided to authors whose works have already been completed and copyrighted.  This is a classic non sequitur.  The reason for increasing the inducement to create something new simply does not apply to an already-created work.  To the contrary, the equity argument actually provides strong support for petitioners.  Members of the public were entitled to rely on a promised access to copyrighted or patented works at the expiration of the terms specified when the exclusive privileges were granted.  On the other hand, authors will receive the full benefit of the exclusive terms that were promised as an inducement to their creativity, and have no equitable claim to increased compensation for doing nothing more.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				One must indulge in two untenable assumptions to find support in the equitable argument offered by respondent&#x97;that the public interest in free access to copyrighted works is entirely worthless and that authors, as a class, should receive a windfall solely based on completed creative activity.  Indeed, Congress has apparently indulged in those assumptions for under the series of extensions to copyrights, only one year&#x92;s worth of creative work&#x97;that copyrighted in 1923&#x97;has fallen into the public domain during the last 80 years.  But as our cases repeatedly and consistently emphasize, ultimate public access is the overriding purpose of the constitutional provision.  See,

            <em>
					Sony Corp.,

				The express grant of a perpetual copyright would unquestionably violate the textual requirement that the authors&#x92; exclusive rights be only &#x93;for limited Times.&#x94;  Whether the extraordinary length of the grants authorized by the 1998 Act are invalid because they are the functional equivalent of perpetual copyrights is a question that need not be answered in this case because the question presented by the certiorari petition merely challenges Congress&#x92; power to extend retroactively the terms of existing copyrights.  Accordingly, there is no need to determine whether the deference that is normally given to congressional policy judgments may save from judicial review its decision respecting the appropriate length of the term.

				  It is important to note, however, that a categorical rule prohibiting retroactive extensions would effectively preclude perpetual copyrights.

						 Justice Harlan wrote a brief concurrence, but did not disagree with this statement.  Justice Black&#x92;s statement echoed a portion of Attorney General Wirt&#x92;s argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 171 (1824): &#x93;The law of Congress declares, that all inventors of useful improvements throughout the United States, shall be entitled to the exclusive right in their discoveries for fourteen years only.  The law of New-York declares, that this inventor shall be entitled to the exclusive use of his discovery for thirty years, and as much longer as the State shall permit.  The law of Congress, by limiting the exclusive right to fourteen years, in effect declares, that after the expiration of that time, the discovery shall be the common right of the whole people of the United States.&#x94;

						Attorney General Wirt made this precise point in his argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 175: &#x93;The limitation is not for the advantage of the inventor, but of society at large, which is to take the benefit of the invention after the period of limitation has expired.  The patentee pays a duty on his patent, which is an effective source of revenue to the United States.  It is virtually a contract between each patentee and the people of the United States, by which the time of exclusive and secure enjoyment is limited, and then the benefit of the discovery results to the public.&#x94;

Congress seem to be tied down to the single mode of encouraging inventions by granting the exclusive benefit of them for a limited time, and therefore to have no more power to give a further encouragement out of a fund of land than a fund of money.  This fetter on the National Legislature tho&#x92; an unfortunate one, was a deliberate one.  The Latitude of authority now wished for was strongly urged and expressly rejected.&#x94;  Madison&#x92;s description of the Copyright/Patent Clause as a &#x93;fetter on the National Legislature&#x94; is fully consistent with this Court&#x92;s opinion in Graham.

						 Importantly, even this first Act required a quid pro quo in order to receive federal copyright protection.  In order to receive protection under the Act, the author was first required to register the work: &#x93;That no person shall be entitled to the benefit of this act, in cases where any map, chart, book or books, hath or have been already printed and published, unless he shall first deposit, and in all other cases, unless he shall before publication deposit a printed copy of the title of such map, chart, book or books, in the clerk&#x92;s office of the district court where the author or proprietor shall reside.&#x94; &#xA7;3,

124.  This registration requirement in federal district court&#x97;a requirement obviously not required under the various state laws protecting written works&#x97;further illustrates that the 1790 Act created new rights, rather than extending existing rights.

						 In the period before our decision in Wheaton, the pre-emptive effect of the Patent/Copyright Clause was also a matter of serious debate within the legal profession. Indeed, in their argument in this Court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 44&#x96;61, 141&#x96;157, the defenders of New York&#x92;s grant of a 30-year monopoly on the passenger trade between New Jersey and Manhattan argued that the Clause actually should be interpreted as confirming the State&#x92;s authority to grant monopoly privileges that supplemented any federal grant. That argument is, of course, flatly inconsistent with our recent unanimous decision in Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S 141 (1989).  Although Attorney General Wirt had urged the Court to endorse our present interpretation of the Clause, its implicit limitations were unsettled when the 1831 Copyright Act was passed.

						  It is true, as the majority points out, ante at 11, n. 5, that Graham did not expressly overrule those earlier cases because Graham did not address the issue whether Congress could revive expired patents. That observation does not even arguably justify reliance on a set of old circuit court cases to support a proposition that is inconsistent with our present understanding of the limits imposed by the Copyright/Patent Clause.  After all, a unanimous Court recently endorsed the precise analysis that the majority now seeks to characterize as &#x93;wishful thinking.&#x94;  Ante, at 11, n. 5.  See Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;Congress may not create patent monopolies of unlimited duration, nor may it &#x91;authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain, or to restrict free access to materials already available&#x92; &#x94; (quoting Graham, 383 U.

						 Similarly, the validity of earlier retroactive extensions of copyright protection is not at issue in this case.  To decide the question now presented, we need not consider whether the reliance and expectation interests that have been established by prior extensions passed years ago would alter the result.  Cf. Heckler v. Mathews, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/465/728" class="subref" title="subref">465 U. S. 728</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">746</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;We have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting reasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an unconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time&#x94;).  Those interests are not at issue now, because the act under review in this case was passed only four years ago and has been under challenge in court since shortly after its enactment.

				  As I shall explain, the reasons why a State may not extend the life of a patent apply to Congress as well.  If Congress may not expand the scope of a patent monopoly, it also may not extend the life of a copyright beyond its expiration date.  Accordingly, insofar as the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.
2827, purported to extend the life of unexpired copyrights, it is invalid.  Because the majority&#x92;s contrary conclusion rests on the mistaken premise that this Court has virtually no role in reviewing congressional grants of monopoly privileges to authors, inventors and their successors, I respectfully dissent.

If an inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention; if he should for a long period of years retain the monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure; and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to secure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under it during his fourteen years; it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful arts, and give a premium to those, who should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries.&#x94;

 (&#x93;[T]he patent system represents a carefully crafted bargain that encourages both the creation and the public disclosure of new and useful advances in technology, in return for an exclusive monopoly for a limited period of time&#x94;).  It would be manifestly unfair if, after issuing a patent, the Government as a representative of the public sought to modify the bargain by shortening the term of the patent in order to accelerate public access to the invention.  The fairness considerations that underlie the constitutional protections against 
				<em>
					ex post facto
				</em>
				 laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts would presumably disable Congress from making such a retroactive change in the public&#x92;s bargain with an inventor without providing compensation for the taking.  Those same considerations should protect members of the public who make plans to exploit an invention as soon as it enters the public domain from a retroactive modification of the bargain that extends the term of the patent monopoly.  As I discuss below, the few historical exceptions to this rule do not undermine the constitutional analysis.  For quite plainly, the limitations &#x93;implicit in the Patent Clause itself,&#x94; 489 U. S., at 151, adequately explain why neither a State nor Congress may &#x93;extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date,&#x94;

				Neither the purpose of encouraging new inventions nor the overriding interest in advancing progress by adding knowledge to the public domain is served by retroactively increasing the inventor&#x92;s compensation for a completed invention and frustrating the legitimate expectations of members of the public who want to make use of it in a free market.

				 extensions of copyrights result in a gratuitous transfer of wealth from the public to authors, publishers, and their successors in interest.  Such retroactive extensions do not even arguably serve either of the purposes of the Copyright/Patent Clause.  The reasons why such extensions of the patent monopoly are unconstitutional apply to copyrights as well.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent, however, advances four arguments in support of the constitutionality of such retroactive extensions: (1) the first Copyright Act enacted shortly after the Constitution was ratified applied to works that had already been produced; (2) later Congresses have repeatedly authorized extensions of copyrights and patents; (3) such extensions promote the useful arts by giving copyright holders an incentive to preserve and restore certain valuable motion pictures; and (4) as a matter of equity, whenever Congress provides a longer term as an incentive to the creation of new works by authors, it should provide an equivalent reward to the owners of all unexpired copyrights.  None of these arguments is persuasive.

R. 41, by contrast, added the phrase &#x93;within the United States&#x94; to that limitation and expressly authorized patent protection for &#x93;any person, who shall after the passing of this act, first import into the United States . . . any . . . device . . . not before used or known in the said States.&#x94;  6 Documentary History,

Though exact records of the floor debate are lost, correspondence from House members indicate that doubts about the constitutionality of such a provision led to its removal.

				The final version of the 1790 Patent Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
109, did not contain the geographic qualifier and thus did not provide for patents of importation.  This statutory omission, coupled with the contemporaneous statements by legislators, provides strong evidence that Congress recognized significant limitations on their constitutional authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause to extend protection to a class of intellectual properties.  This recognition of a categorical constitutional limitation is fundamentally at odds with the majority&#x92;s reading of Article I, &#xA7;8 to provide essentially no limit on congressional action under the Clause.  If early congressional practice does, indeed, inform our analysis, as it should, then the majority&#x92;s judicial excision of these constitutional limits cannot be correct.

				Congress also passed the first Copyright Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124, in 1790.  At that time there were a number of maps, charts, and books that had already been printed, some of which were copyrighted under state laws and some of which were arguably entitled to perpetual protection under the common law.  The federal statute applied to those works as well as to new works.  In some cases the application of the new federal rule reduced the pre-existing protections, and in others it may have increased the protection.  What is significant is that the statute provided a general rule creating new federal rights that supplanted the diverse state rights that previously existed.  It did not extend or attach to any of those pre-existing state and common-law rights: &#x93;That congress, in passing the act of 1790, did not legislate in reference to existing rights, appears clear.&#x94;  Wheaton

 (&#x93;As this Court has repeatedly said, the Congress did not sanction an existing right but created a new one&#x94;).  Congress set in place a federal structure governing certain types of intellectual property for the new Republic.  That Congress exercised its unquestionable constitutional authority to

				  Precisely put, the question presented by this case does not even implicate the 1790 Act, for that Act created, rather than extended, copyright protection.

				Moreover, members of Congress in 1790 were well aware of the distinction between the creation of new copyright regimes and the extension of existing copyrights.  The 1790 Act was patterned, in many ways, after the Statute of Anne enacted in England in 1710.  8 Ann., c. 19; see

.  The English statute, in addition to providing authors with copyrights on new works for a term of 14 years renewable for another 14-year term, also replaced the booksellers&#x92; claimed perpetual rights in existing works with a single 21-year term.  In 1735, the booksellers proposed an amendment that would have extended the terms of existing copyrights until 1756, but the amendment was defeated.  Opponents of the amendment had argued that if the bill were to pass, it would &#x93;in Effect be establishing a perpetual Monopoly &#x2026; only to increase the private Gain of the Booksellers &#x2026; .&#x94;

				Since the creation of federal patent and copyright protection in 1790, Congress has passed a variety of legislation, both providing specific relief for individual authors and inventors as well as changing the general statutes conferring patent and copyright privileges.  Some of the changes did indeed, as the majority describes, extend existing protections retroactively.  Other changes, however, did not do so.  A more complete and comprehensive look at the history of congressional action under the

				Congress, aside from changing the process of applying for a patent in the 1793 Patent Act, did not significantly alter the basic patent and copyright systems for the next 40 years.  During this time, however, Congress did consider many private bills.

				The first example relied upon by respondent, the extension of Oliver Evans&#x92; patent in 1808, ch. 8, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70, demonstrates the pitfalls of relying on an incomplete historical analysis.  Evans, an inventor who had developed several improvements in milling flour, received the third federal patent on January 7, 1791.  See Federico, Patent Trials of Oliver Evans, 27 J. Pat. Off. Soc. 586, 590 (1945).  Under the 14-year term provided by the 1790 Patent Act, this patent was to expire on January 7, 1805.  Claiming that 14 years had not provided him a sufficient time to realize income from his invention and that the net profits were spent developing improvements on the steam engine, Evans first sought an extension of his patent in December 1804.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 598; 14 Annals of Congress 1002.  Unsuccessful in 1804, he tried again in 1805, and yet again in 1806, to persuade Congress to pass his private bill.  Undaunted, Evans tried one last time to revive his expired patent after receiving an adverse judgment in an infringement action.  See 
				<em>
					Evans 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 8 F. Cas. 837 (No. 4,555) (CC Pa. 1807).  This time, his effort at private legislation was successful and Congress passed a bill extending his patent for 14 years.  See An Act for the relief of Oliver Evans, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70.  This legislation, passed January 21, 1808, restored a patent monopoly for an invention that had been in the public domain for over four years.  As such, this Act unquestionably exceeded Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause: &#x93;The Congress in the exercise of the patent power may not overreach the restraints imposed by the stated constitutional purpose. &#x2026;

				This extension of patent protection to an expired patent was not an isolated incident.  Congress passed private bills either directly extending patents or allowing otherwise untimely applicants to apply for patent extensions for approximately 75 patents between 1790 and 1875.  Of these 75 patents, at least 56 had already fallen into the public domain.

				Copyright legislation has a similar history.  The federal Copyright Act was first amended in 1831. That amendment, like later amendments, not only authorized a longer term for new works, but also extended the terms of unexpired copyrights.  Respondent argues that that historical practice effectively establishes the constitutionality of retroactive extensions of unexpired copyrights.  Of course, the practice buttressess the presumption of validity that attaches to every Act of Congress.  But, as our decision in

				<em>

				It would be particularly unwise to attach constitutional significance to the 1831 amendment because of the very different legal landscape against which it was enacted.  Congress based its authority to pass the amendment on grounds shortly thereafter declared improper by the Court.  The Judiciary Committee Report prepared for the House of Representatives asserted that &#x93;an author has an exclusive and perpetual right, in preference to any other, to the fruits of his labor.&#x94;  7 Gales &amp; Seaton, Register of Debates in Congress cxx (1831).

				The general presumption that historic practice illuminates the constitutionality of congressional action is not controlling in this case.

				The majority&#x92;s reliance on the other patent case it cites is similarly misplaced.  Contrary to the suggestion in the Court&#x92;s opinion, 
				<em>

				</em>
				v. 
				<em>

				, at 10&#x96;11. The question in that case was whether the former employer of the inventor, one James Harley, could be held liable as an infringer for continuing to use the process that Harley had invented in 1834 when he was in its employ.  The Court first held that the employer&#x92;s use of the process before the patent issued was not a public use that would invalidate the patent, even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.  1 How., at 206&#x96;208.  The Court then disposed of the case on the ground that a statute enacted in 1839 protected the alleged infringer&#x92;s right to continue to use the process after the patent issued.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 209&#x96;211.  Our opinion said nothing about the power of Congress to extend the life of an issued patent.  It did note that Congress has plenary power to legislate on the subject of patents provided &#x93;that they do not take away the rights of property in existing patents.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 206.  The fact that Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee is, of course, fully consistent with the view that it cannot enlarge the patent monopoly to the detriment of the public after a patent has issued.

				Respondent also argues that the Act promotes the useful arts by providing incentives to restore old movies.  For at least three reasons, the interest in preserving perishable copies of old copyrighted films does not justify a wholesale extension of existing copyrights.  First, such restoration and preservation will not even arguably promote any new works by authors or inventors.  And, of course, any original expression in the restoration and preservation of movies will receive new copyright protection.

            </a>
				  Second, however strong the justification for preserving such works may be, that justification applies equally to works whose copyrights have already expired.  Yet no one seriously contends that the Copyright/Patent Clause would authorize the grant of monopoly privileges for works already in the public domain solely to encourage their restoration.  Finally, even if this concern with aging movies would permit congressional protection, the remedy offered&#x97;a blanket extension of all copyrights&#x97;simply bears no relationship to the alleged harm.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Finally, respondent relies on concerns of equity to justify the retroactive extension.  If Congress concludes that a longer period of exclusivity is necessary in order to provide an adequate incentive to authors to produce new works, respondent seems to believe that simple fairness requires that the same lengthened period be provided to authors whose works have already been completed and copyrighted.  This is a classic non sequitur.  The reason for increasing the inducement to create something new simply does not apply to an already-created work.  To the contrary, the equity argument actually provides strong support for petitioners.  Members of the public were entitled to rely on a promised access to copyrighted or patented works at the expiration of the terms specified when the exclusive privileges were granted.  On the other hand, authors will receive the full benefit of the exclusive terms that were promised as an inducement to their creativity, and have no equitable claim to increased compensation for doing nothing more.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				One must indulge in two untenable assumptions to find support in the equitable argument offered by respondent&#x97;that the public interest in free access to copyrighted works is entirely worthless and that authors, as a class, should receive a windfall solely based on completed creative activity.  Indeed, Congress has apparently indulged in those assumptions for under the series of extensions to copyrights, only one year&#x92;s worth of creative work&#x97;that copyrighted in 1923&#x97;has fallen into the public domain during the last 80 years.  But as our cases repeatedly and consistently emphasize, ultimate public access is the overriding purpose of the constitutional provision.  See,

				The express grant of a perpetual copyright would unquestionably violate the textual requirement that the authors&#x92; exclusive rights be only &#x93;for limited Times.&#x94;  Whether the extraordinary length of the grants authorized by the 1998 Act are invalid because they are the functional equivalent of perpetual copyrights is a question that need not be answered in this case because the question presented by the certiorari petition merely challenges Congress&#x92; power to extend retroactively the terms of existing copyrights.  Accordingly, there is no need to determine whether the deference that is normally given to congressional policy judgments may save from judicial review its decision respecting the appropriate length of the term.

				  It is important to note, however, that a categorical rule prohibiting retroactive extensions would effectively preclude perpetual copyrights.  More importantly, as the House of Lords recognized when it refused to amend the Statute of Anne in 1735, unless the Clause is construed to embody such a categorical rule, Congress may extend existing monopoly privileges

				By failing to protect the public interest in free access to the products of inventive and artistic genius&#x97;indeed, by virtually ignoring the central purpose of the Copyright/Patent Clause&#x97;the Court has quitclaimed to Congress its principal responsibility in this area of the law.  Fairly read, the Court has stated that Congress&#x92; actions under the Copyright/Patent Clause are, for all intents and purposes, judicially unreviewable.  That result cannot be squared with the basic tenets of our constitutional structure.  It is not hyperbole to recall the trenchant words of Chief Justice John Marshall: &#x93;It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.&#x94;

						 Justice Harlan wrote a brief concurrence, but did not disagree with this statement.  Justice Black&#x92;s statement echoed a portion of Attorney General Wirt&#x92;s argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 171 (1824): &#x93;The law of Congress declares, that all inventors of useful improvements throughout the United States, shall be entitled to the exclusive right in their discoveries for fourteen years only.  The law of New-York declares, that this inventor shall be entitled to the exclusive use of his discovery for thirty years, and as much longer as the State shall permit.  The law of Congress, by limiting the exclusive right to fourteen years, in effect declares, that after the expiration of that time, the discovery shall be the common right of the whole people of the United States.&#x94;

						Attorney General Wirt made this precise point in his argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 175: &#x93;The limitation is not for the advantage of the inventor, but of society at large, which is to take the benefit of the invention after the period of limitation has expired.  The patentee pays a duty on his patent, which is an effective source of revenue to the United States.  It is virtually a contract between each patentee and the people of the United States, by which the time of exclusive and secure enjoyment is limited, and then the benefit of the discovery results to the public.&#x94;

						The Court acknowledges that this proposition is &#x93;uncontroversial&#x94; today, see ante, at 11, n. 6, but overlooks the fact that it was highly controversial in the early 1800&#x92;s.  See n. 11, infra.  The Court assumes that the Sears holding rested entirely on the pre-emptive effect of congressional statutes even though the opinion itself, like the opinions  in Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City,

, also relied on the pre-emptive effect of the constitutional provision.  That at least some of the Framers recognized that the Constitution itself imposed a limitation even before Congress acted is demonstrated by Madison&#x92;s letter, quoted in n. 6, infra.

						 &#x93;Your idea of appropriating a district of territory to the encouragement of imported inventions is new and worthy of consideration.  I can not but apprehend however that the clause in the constitution which forbids patents for that purpose will lie equally in the way of your expedient.  Congress seem to be tied down to the single mode of encouraging inventions by granting the exclusive benefit of them for a limited time, and therefore to have no more power to give a further encouragement out of a fund of land than a fund of money.  This fetter on the National Legislature tho&#x92; an unfortunate one, was a deliberate one.  The Latitude of authority now wished for was strongly urged and expressly rejected.&#x94;  Madison&#x92;s description of the Copyright/Patent Clause as a &#x93;fetter on the National Legislature&#x94; is fully consistent with this Court&#x92;s opinion in Graham.

						 Importantly, even this first Act required a quid pro quo in order to receive federal copyright protection.  In order to receive protection under the Act, the author was first required to register the work: &#x93;That no person shall be entitled to the benefit of this act, in cases where any map, chart, book or books, hath or have been already printed and published, unless he shall first deposit, and in all other cases, unless he shall before publication deposit a printed copy of the title of such map, chart, book or books, in the clerk&#x92;s office of the district court where the author or proprietor shall reside.&#x94; &#xA7;3, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124.  This registration requirement in federal district court&#x97;a requirement obviously not required under the various state laws protecting written works&#x97;further illustrates that the 1790 Act created new rights, rather than extending existing rights.

						 Respondent&#x92;s reformulation of the questions presented by this case confuses this basic distinction.  We granted certiorari to consider the question: &#x93;Did the D. C. Circuit err in holding that Congress has the power under the Copyright Clause to extend retroactively the term of existing copyrights?&#x94;  Respondent&#x92;s reformulation of the first question presented&#x97;&#x93;Whether the 20-year extension of the terms of all unexpired copyrights . . . violates the Copyright Clause of the Constitution insofar as it applies to works in existence when it took effect&#x94;&#x97;significantly changes the substance of inquiry by changing the focus from the federal statute at issue to irrelevant common-law protections.  Brief for Respondent I.  Indeed, this reformulation violated this Court&#x92;s Rule 24(1)(a), which states that &#x93;the brief [on the merits] may not raise additional questions or change the substance of the questions already presented in&#x94; the petition for certiorari.

						 In the period before our decision in Wheaton, the pre-emptive effect of the Patent/Copyright Clause was also a matter of serious debate within the legal profession. Indeed, in their argument in this Court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 44&#x96;61, 141&#x96;157, the defenders of New York&#x92;s grant of a 30-year monopoly on the passenger trade between New Jersey and Manhattan argued that the Clause actually should be interpreted as confirming the State&#x92;s authority to grant monopoly privileges that supplemented any federal grant. That argument is, of course, flatly inconsistent with our recent unanimous decision in Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S 141 (1989).  Although Attorney General Wirt had urged the Court to endorse our present interpretation of the Clause, its implicit limitations were unsettled when the 1831 Copyright Act was passed.

						  It is true, as the majority points out, ante at 11, n. 5, that Graham did not expressly overrule those earlier cases because Graham did not address the issue whether Congress could revive expired patents. That observation does not even arguably justify reliance on a set of old circuit court cases to support a proposition that is inconsistent with our present understanding of the limits imposed by the Copyright/Patent Clause.  After all, a unanimous Court recently endorsed the precise analysis that the majority now seeks to characterize as &#x93;wishful thinking.&#x94;  Ante, at 11, n. 5.  See Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;Congress may not create patent monopolies of unlimited duration, nor may it &#x91;authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain, or to restrict free access to materials already available&#x92; &#x94; (quoting Graham, 383 U. S., at 6 )).

						 Similarly, the validity of earlier retroactive extensions of copyright protection is not at issue in this case.  To decide the question now presented, we need not consider whether the reliance and expectation interests that have been established by prior extensions passed years ago would alter the result.  Cf. Heckler v. Mathews, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/465/728" class="subref" title="subref">465 U. S. 728</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">746</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;We have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting reasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an unconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time&#x94;).  Those interests are not at issue now, because the act under review in this case was passed only four years ago and has been under challenge in court since shortly after its enactment.

				  As I shall explain, the reasons why a State may not extend the life of a patent apply to Congress as well.  If Congress may not expand the scope of a patent monopoly, it also may not extend the life of a copyright beyond its expiration date.  Accordingly, insofar as the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.
2827, purported to extend the life of unexpired copyrights, it is invalid.  Because the majority&#x92;s contrary conclusion rests on the mistaken premise that this Court has virtually no role in reviewing congressional grants of monopoly privileges to authors, inventors and their successors, I respectfully dissent.

				The authority to issue copyrights stems from the same Clause in the Constitution that created the patent power.  It provides:

If an inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention; if he should for a long period of years retain the monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure; and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to secure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under it during his fourteen years; it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful arts, and give a premium to those, who should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries.&#x94;

It would be manifestly unfair if, after issuing a patent, the Government as a representative of the public sought to modify the bargain by shortening the term of the patent in order to accelerate public access to the invention.  The fairness considerations that underlie the constitutional protections against 
				<em>
					ex post facto
				</em>
				 laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts would presumably disable Congress from making such a retroactive change in the public&#x92;s bargain with an inventor without providing compensation for the taking.  Those same considerations should protect members of the public who make plans to exploit an invention as soon as it enters the public domain from a retroactive modification of the bargain that extends the term of the patent monopoly.  As I discuss below, the few historical exceptions to this rule do not undermine the constitutional analysis.  For quite plainly, the limitations &#x93;implicit in the Patent Clause itself,&#x94; 489 U. S., at 151, adequately explain why neither a State nor Congress may &#x93;extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date,&#x94;

				Neither the purpose of encouraging new inventions nor the overriding interest in advancing progress by adding knowledge to the public domain is served by retroactively increasing the inventor&#x92;s compensation for a completed invention and frustrating the legitimate expectations of members of the public who want to make use of it in a free market.

				 extensions of copyrights result in a gratuitous transfer of wealth from the public to authors, publishers, and their successors in interest.  Such retroactive extensions do not even arguably serve either of the purposes of the Copyright/Patent Clause.  The reasons why such extensions of the patent monopoly are unconstitutional apply to copyrights as well.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent, however, advances four arguments in support of the constitutionality of such retroactive extensions: (1) the first Copyright Act enacted shortly after the Constitution was ratified applied to works that had already been produced; (2) later Congresses have repeatedly authorized extensions of copyrights and patents; (3) such extensions promote the useful arts by giving copyright holders an incentive to preserve and restore certain valuable motion pictures; and (4) as a matter of equity, whenever Congress provides a longer term as an incentive to the creation of new works by authors, it should provide an equivalent reward to the owners of all unexpired copyrights.  None of these arguments is persuasive.

Whereas H. R. 10 would have extended patent protection to only those inventions that were &#x93;not before known or used,&#x94; H.

				The final version of the 1790 Patent Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
109, did not contain the geographic qualifier and thus did not provide for patents of importation.  This statutory omission, coupled with the contemporaneous statements by legislators, provides strong evidence that Congress recognized significant limitations on their constitutional authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause to extend protection to a class of intellectual properties.  This recognition of a categorical constitutional limitation is fundamentally at odds with the majority&#x92;s reading of Article I, &#xA7;8 to provide essentially no limit on congressional action under the Clause.  If early congressional practice does, indeed, inform our analysis, as it should, then the majority&#x92;s judicial excision of these constitutional limits cannot be correct.

				Congress also passed the first Copyright Act,

124, in 1790.  At that time there were a number of maps, charts, and books that had already been printed, some of which were copyrighted under state laws and some of which were arguably entitled to perpetual protection under the common law.  The federal statute applied to those works as well as to new works.  In some cases the application of the new federal rule reduced the pre-existing protections, and in others it may have increased the protection.  What is significant is that the statute provided a general rule creating new federal rights that supplanted the diverse state rights that previously existed.  It did not extend or attach to any of those pre-existing state and common-law rights: &#x93;That congress, in passing the act of 1790, did not legislate in reference to existing rights, appears clear.&#x94;  Wheaton

				Moreover, members of Congress in 1790 were well aware of the distinction between the creation of new copyright regimes and the extension of existing copyrights.  The 1790 Act was patterned, in many ways, after the Statute of Anne enacted in England in 1710.  8 Ann., c. 19; see

.  The English statute, in addition to providing authors with copyrights on new works for a term of 14 years renewable for another 14-year term, also replaced the booksellers&#x92; claimed perpetual rights in existing works with a single 21-year term.  In 1735, the booksellers proposed an amendment that would have extended the terms of existing copyrights until 1756, but the amendment was defeated.  Opponents of the amendment had argued that if the bill were to pass, it would &#x93;in Effect be establishing a perpetual Monopoly &#x2026; only to increase the private Gain of the Booksellers &#x2026; .&#x94;

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70, demonstrates the pitfalls of relying on an incomplete historical analysis.  Evans, an inventor who had developed several improvements in milling flour, received the third federal patent on January 7, 1791.  See Federico, Patent Trials of Oliver Evans, 27 J. Pat. Off. Soc. 586, 590 (1945).  Under the 14-year term provided by the 1790 Patent Act, this patent was to expire on January 7, 1805.  Claiming that 14 years had not provided him a sufficient time to realize income from his invention and that the net profits were spent developing improvements on the steam engine, Evans first sought an extension of his patent in December 1804.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 598; 14 Annals of Congress 1002.  Unsuccessful in 1804, he tried again in 1805, and yet again in 1806, to persuade Congress to pass his private bill.  Undaunted, Evans tried one last time to revive his expired patent after receiving an adverse judgment in an infringement action.  See 
				<em>

				v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 8 F. Cas. 837 (No. 4,555) (CC Pa. 1807).  This time, his effort at private legislation was successful and Congress passed a bill extending his patent for 14 years.  See An Act for the relief of Oliver Evans, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70.  This legislation, passed January 21, 1808, restored a patent monopoly for an invention that had been in the public domain for over four years.  As such, this Act unquestionably exceeded Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause: &#x93;The Congress in the exercise of the patent power may not overreach the restraints imposed by the stated constitutional purpose. &#x2026;

				Copyright legislation has a similar history.  The federal Copyright Act was first amended in 1831. That amendment, like later amendments, not only authorized a longer term for new works, but also extended the terms of unexpired copyrights.

				It would be particularly unwise to attach constitutional significance to the 1831 amendment because of the very different legal landscape against which it was enacted.  Congress based its authority to pass the amendment on grounds shortly thereafter declared improper by the Court.

				The majority&#x92;s reliance on the other patent case it cites is similarly misplaced.  Contrary to the suggestion in the Court&#x92;s opinion, 
				<em>

				</em>
				v. 
				<em>

				, at 10&#x96;11. The question in that case was whether the former employer of the inventor, one James Harley, could be held liable as an infringer for continuing to use the process that Harley had invented in 1834 when he was in its employ.  The Court first held that the employer&#x92;s use of the process before the patent issued was not a public use that would invalidate the patent, even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.  1 How., at 206&#x96;208.  The Court then disposed of the case on the ground that a statute enacted in 1839 protected the alleged infringer&#x92;s right to continue to use the process after the patent issued.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 209&#x96;211.  Our opinion said nothing about the power of Congress to extend the life of an issued patent.  It did note that Congress has plenary power to legislate on the subject of patents provided &#x93;that they do not take away the rights of property in existing patents.&#x94;  
				<em>

				</em>
				at 206.  The fact that Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee is, of course, fully consistent with the view that it cannot enlarge the patent monopoly to the detriment of the public after a patent has issued.

				The history of retroactive extensions of existing and expired copyrights and patents, though relevant, is not conclusive of the constitutionality of the Sonny Bono Act.  The fact that the Court has not previously passed upon the constitutionality of retroactive copyright extensions does not insulate the present extension from constitutional challenge.

				Respondent also argues that the Act promotes the useful arts by providing incentives to restore old movies.  For at least three reasons, the interest in preserving perishable copies of old copyrighted films does not justify a wholesale extension of existing copyrights.  First, such restoration and preservation will not even arguably promote any new works by authors or inventors.  And, of course, any original expression in the restoration and preservation of movies will receive new copyright protection.

            </a>
				  Second, however strong the justification for preserving such works may be, that justification applies equally to works whose copyrights have already expired.  Yet no one seriously contends that the Copyright/Patent Clause would authorize the grant of monopoly privileges for works already in the public domain solely to encourage their restoration.  Finally, even if this concern with aging movies would permit congressional protection, the remedy offered&#x97;a blanket extension of all copyrights&#x97;simply bears no relationship to the alleged harm.

				Finally, respondent relies on concerns of equity to justify the retroactive extension.  If Congress concludes that a longer period of exclusivity is necessary in order to provide an adequate incentive to authors to produce new works, respondent seems to believe that simple fairness requires that the same lengthened period be provided to authors whose works have already been completed and copyrighted.  This is a classic non sequitur.  The reason for increasing the inducement to create something new simply does not apply to an already-created work.  To the contrary, the equity argument actually provides strong support for petitioners.  Members of the public were entitled to rely on a promised access to copyrighted or patented works at the expiration of the terms specified when the exclusive privileges were granted.  On the other hand, authors will receive the full benefit of the exclusive terms that were promised as an inducement to their creativity, and have no equitable claim to increased compensation for doing nothing more.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				One must indulge in two untenable assumptions to find support in the equitable argument offered by respondent&#x97;that the public interest in free access to copyrighted works is entirely worthless and that authors, as a class, should receive a windfall solely based on completed creative activity.  Indeed, Congress has apparently indulged in those assumptions for under the series of extensions to copyrights, only one year&#x92;s worth of creative work&#x97;that copyrighted in 1923&#x97;has fallen into the public domain during the last 80 years.  But as our cases repeatedly and consistently emphasize, ultimate public access is the overriding purpose of the constitutional provision.  See,

				The express grant of a perpetual copyright would unquestionably violate the textual requirement that the authors&#x92; exclusive rights be only &#x93;for limited Times.&#x94;  Whether the extraordinary length of the grants authorized by the 1998 Act are invalid because they are the functional equivalent of perpetual copyrights is a question that need not be answered in this case because the question presented by the certiorari petition merely challenges Congress&#x92; power to extend retroactively the terms of existing copyrights.  Accordingly, there is no need to determine whether the deference that is normally given to congressional policy judgments may save from judicial review its decision respecting the appropriate length of the term.

				  It is important to note, however, that a categorical rule prohibiting retroactive extensions would effectively preclude perpetual copyrights.

				By failing to protect the public interest in free access to the products of inventive and artistic genius&#x97;indeed, by virtually ignoring the central purpose of the Copyright/Patent Clause&#x97;the Court has quitclaimed to Congress its principal responsibility in this area of the law.  Fairly read, the Court has stated that Congress&#x92; actions under the Copyright/Patent Clause are, for all intents and purposes, judicially unreviewable.  That result cannot be squared with the basic tenets of our constitutional structure.  It is not hyperbole to recall the trenchant words of Chief Justice John Marshall: &#x93;It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.&#x94;

						 Justice Harlan wrote a brief concurrence, but did not disagree with this statement.  Justice Black&#x92;s statement echoed a portion of Attorney General Wirt&#x92;s argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 171 (1824): &#x93;The law of Congress declares, that all inventors of useful improvements throughout the United States, shall be entitled to the exclusive right in their discoveries for fourteen years only.  The law of New-York declares, that this inventor shall be entitled to the exclusive use of his discovery for thirty years, and as much longer as the State shall permit.  The law of Congress, by limiting the exclusive right to fourteen years, in effect declares, that after the expiration of that time, the discovery shall be the common right of the whole people of the United States.&#x94;

						Attorney General Wirt made this precise point in his argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 175: &#x93;The limitation is not for the advantage of the inventor, but of society at large, which is to take the benefit of the invention after the period of limitation has expired.  The patentee pays a duty on his patent, which is an effective source of revenue to the United States.  It is virtually a contract between each patentee and the people of the United States, by which the time of exclusive and secure enjoyment is limited, and then the benefit of the discovery results to the public.&#x94;

						The Court acknowledges that this proposition is &#x93;uncontroversial&#x94; today, see ante, at 11, n. 6, but overlooks the fact that it was highly controversial in the early 1800&#x92;s.  See n. 11, infra.  The Court assumes that the Sears holding rested entirely on the pre-emptive effect of congressional statutes even though the opinion itself, like the opinions  in Graham v. John Deere Co. of Kansas City,

						 &#x93;Your idea of appropriating a district of territory to the encouragement of imported inventions is new and worthy of consideration.  I can not but apprehend however that the clause in the constitution which forbids patents for that purpose will lie equally in the way of your expedient.  Congress seem to be tied down to the single mode of encouraging inventions by granting the exclusive benefit of them for a limited time, and therefore to have no more power to give a further encouragement out of a fund of land than a fund of money.  This fetter on the National Legislature tho&#x92; an unfortunate one, was a deliberate one.  The Latitude of authority now wished for was strongly urged and expressly rejected.&#x94;  Madison&#x92;s description of the Copyright/Patent Clause as a &#x93;fetter on the National Legislature&#x94; is fully consistent with this Court&#x92;s opinion in Graham.

						 Importantly, even this first Act required a quid pro quo in order to receive federal copyright protection.  In order to receive protection under the Act, the author was first required to register the work: &#x93;That no person shall be entitled to the benefit of this act, in cases where any map, chart, book or books, hath or have been already printed and published, unless he shall first deposit, and in all other cases, unless he shall before publication deposit a printed copy of the title of such map, chart, book or books, in the clerk&#x92;s office of the district court where the author or proprietor shall reside.&#x94; &#xA7;3, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124.  This registration requirement in federal district court&#x97;a requirement obviously not required under the various state laws protecting written works&#x97;further illustrates that the 1790 Act created new rights, rather than extending existing rights.

						 Respondent&#x92;s reformulation of the questions presented by this case confuses this basic distinction.  We granted certiorari to consider the question: &#x93;Did the D. C.

						 In the period before our decision in Wheaton, the pre-emptive effect of the Patent/Copyright Clause was also a matter of serious debate within the legal profession. Indeed, in their argument in this Court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 44&#x96;61, 141&#x96;157, the defenders of New York&#x92;s grant of a 30-year monopoly on the passenger trade between New Jersey and Manhattan argued that the Clause actually should be interpreted as confirming the State&#x92;s authority to grant monopoly privileges that supplemented any federal grant. That argument is, of course, flatly inconsistent with our recent unanimous decision in Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S 141 (1989).  Although Attorney General Wirt had urged the Court to endorse our present interpretation of the Clause, its implicit limitations were unsettled when the 1831 Copyright Act was passed.

						  It is true, as the majority points out, ante at 11, n. 5, that Graham did not expressly overrule those earlier cases because Graham did not address the issue whether Congress could revive expired patents. That observation does not even arguably justify reliance on a set of old circuit court cases to support a proposition that is inconsistent with our present understanding of the limits imposed by the Copyright/Patent Clause.  After all, a unanimous Court recently endorsed the precise analysis that the majority now seeks to characterize as &#x93;wishful thinking.&#x94;  Ante, at 11, n. 5.  See Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;Congress may not create patent monopolies of unlimited duration, nor may it &#x91;authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain, or to restrict free access to materials already available&#x92; &#x94; (quoting Graham, 383 U.

						 Similarly, the validity of earlier retroactive extensions of copyright protection is not at issue in this case.  To decide the question now presented, we need not consider whether the reliance and expectation interests that have been established by prior extensions passed years ago would alter the result.  Cf. Heckler v. Mathews, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/465/728" class="subref" title="subref">465 U. S. 728</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">746</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;We have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting reasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an unconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time&#x94;).  Those interests are not at issue now, because the act under review in this case was passed only four years ago and has been under challenge in court since shortly after its enactment.

				  As I shall explain, the reasons why a State may not extend the life of a patent apply to Congress as well.  If Congress may not expand the scope of a patent monopoly, it also may not extend the life of a copyright beyond its expiration date.  Accordingly, insofar as the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.
2827, purported to extend the life of unexpired copyrights, it is invalid.  Because the majority&#x92;s contrary conclusion rests on the mistaken premise that this Court has virtually no role in reviewing congressional grants of monopoly privileges to authors, inventors and their successors, I respectfully dissent.

				The authority to issue copyrights stems from the same Clause in the Constitution that created the patent power.  It provides:

If an inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention; if he should for a long period of years retain the monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure; and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to secure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under it during his fourteen years; it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful arts, and give a premium to those, who should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries.&#x94;

 (&#x93;[T]he patent system represents a carefully crafted bargain that encourages both the creation and the public disclosure of new and useful advances in technology, in return for an exclusive monopoly for a limited period of time&#x94;).  It would be manifestly unfair if, after issuing a patent, the Government as a representative of the public sought to modify the bargain by shortening the term of the patent in order to accelerate public access to the invention.  The fairness considerations that underlie the constitutional protections against 
				<em>

				 laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts would presumably disable Congress from making such a retroactive change in the public&#x92;s bargain with an inventor without providing compensation for the taking.  Those same considerations should protect members of the public who make plans to exploit an invention as soon as it enters the public domain from a retroactive modification of the bargain that extends the term of the patent monopoly.  As I discuss below, the few historical exceptions to this rule do not undermine the constitutional analysis.  For quite plainly, the limitations &#x93;implicit in the Patent Clause itself,&#x94; 489 U.

				 extensions of copyrights result in a gratuitous transfer of wealth from the public to authors, publishers, and their successors in interest.  Such retroactive extensions do not even arguably serve either of the purposes of the Copyright/Patent Clause.  The reasons why such extensions of the patent monopoly are unconstitutional apply to copyrights as well.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Respondent, however, advances four arguments in support of the constitutionality of such retroactive extensions: (1) the first Copyright Act enacted shortly after the Constitution was ratified applied to works that had already been produced; (2) later Congresses have repeatedly authorized extensions of copyrights and patents; (3) such extensions promote the useful arts by giving copyright holders an incentive to preserve and restore certain valuable motion pictures; and (4) as a matter of equity, whenever Congress provides a longer term as an incentive to the creation of new works by authors, it should provide an equivalent reward to the owners of all unexpired copyrights.  None of these arguments is persuasive.

Whereas H. R. 10 would have extended patent protection to only those inventions that were &#x93;not before known or used,&#x94; H.

				The final version of the 1790 Patent Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
109, did not contain the geographic qualifier and thus did not provide for patents of importation.  This statutory omission, coupled with the contemporaneous statements by legislators, provides strong evidence that Congress recognized significant limitations on their constitutional authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause to extend protection to a class of intellectual properties.  This recognition of a categorical constitutional limitation is fundamentally at odds with the majority&#x92;s reading of Article I, &#xA7;8 to provide essentially no limit on congressional action under the Clause.  If early congressional practice does, indeed, inform our analysis, as it should, then the majority&#x92;s judicial excision of these constitutional limits cannot be correct.

				Congress also passed the first Copyright Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124, in 1790.  At that time there were a number of maps, charts, and books that had already been printed, some of which were copyrighted under state laws and some of which were arguably entitled to perpetual protection under the common law.  The federal statute applied to those works as well as to new works.  In some cases the application of the new federal rule reduced the pre-existing protections, and in others it may have increased the protection.  What is significant is that the statute provided a general rule creating new federal rights that supplanted the diverse state rights that previously existed.  It did not extend or attach to any of those pre-existing state and common-law rights: &#x93;That congress, in passing the act of 1790, did not legislate in reference to existing rights, appears clear.&#x94;  Wheaton

 (&#x93;As this Court has repeatedly said, the Congress did not sanction an existing right but created a new one&#x94;).

				Moreover, members of Congress in 1790 were well aware of the distinction between the creation of new copyright regimes and the extension of existing copyrights.  The 1790 Act was patterned, in many ways, after the Statute of Anne enacted in England in 1710.  8 Ann., c. 19; see

.  The English statute, in addition to providing authors with copyrights on new works for a term of 14 years renewable for another 14-year term, also replaced the booksellers&#x92; claimed perpetual rights in existing works with a single 21-year term.  In 1735, the booksellers proposed an amendment that would have extended the terms of existing copyrights until 1756, but the amendment was defeated.  Opponents of the amendment had argued that if the bill were to pass, it would &#x93;in Effect be establishing a perpetual Monopoly &#x2026; only to increase the private Gain of the Booksellers &#x2026; .&#x94;

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70, demonstrates the pitfalls of relying on an incomplete historical analysis.  Evans, an inventor who had developed several improvements in milling flour, received the third federal patent on January 7, 1791.  See Federico, Patent Trials of Oliver Evans, 27 J. Pat. Off. Soc. 586, 590 (1945).  Under the 14-year term provided by the 1790 Patent Act, this patent was to expire on January 7, 1805.  Claiming that 14 years had not provided him a sufficient time to realize income from his invention and that the net profits were spent developing improvements on the steam engine, Evans first sought an extension of his patent in December 1804.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 598; 14 Annals of Congress 1002.  Unsuccessful in 1804, he tried again in 1805, and yet again in 1806, to persuade Congress to pass his private bill.  Undaunted, Evans tried one last time to revive his expired patent after receiving an adverse judgment in an infringement action.  See 
				<em>
					Evans 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 8 F. Cas. 837 (No. 4,555) (CC Pa. 1807).  This time, his effort at private legislation was successful and Congress passed a bill extending his patent for 14 years.  See An Act for the relief of Oliver Evans, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70.  This legislation, passed January 21, 1808, restored a patent monopoly for an invention that had been in the public domain for over four years.  As such, this Act unquestionably exceeded Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause: &#x93;The Congress in the exercise of the patent power may not overreach the restraints imposed by the stated constitutional purpose. &#x2026;

				Copyright legislation has a similar history.  The federal Copyright Act was first amended in 1831. That amendment, like later amendments, not only authorized a longer term for new works, but also extended the terms of unexpired copyrights.

				It would be particularly unwise to attach constitutional significance to the 1831 amendment because of the very different legal landscape against which it was enacted.  Congress based its authority to pass the amendment on grounds shortly thereafter declared improper by the Court.  The Judiciary Committee Report prepared for the House of Representatives asserted that &#x93;an author has an exclusive and perpetual right, in preference to any other, to the fruits of his labor.&#x94;  7 Gales &amp; Seaton, Register of Debates in Congress cxx (1831).

				In 1861, Congress amended the term of patents, from a 14-year term plus opportunity for 7-year extension to a flat 17 years with no extension permitted.  Act of Mar. 2, 1861, ch. 88, &#xA7;16,

				  To be sure, Congress, at many times in its history, has retroactively extended the terms of existing copyrights and patents.  This history, however, reveals a much more heterogeneous practice than respondent contends.  It is replete with actions that were unquestionably unconstitutional.  Though relevant, the history is not dispositive of the constitutionality of Sonny Bono Act.

				The general presumption that historic practice illuminates the constitutionality of congressional action is not controlling in this case.  That presumption is strongest when the earliest acts of Congress are considered, for the overlap of identity between those who created the Constitution and those who first constituted Congress provides &#x93;contemporaneous and weighty evidence&#x94; of the Constitution&#x92;s &#x93;true meaning.&#x94;

				The majority&#x92;s reliance on the other patent case it cites is similarly misplaced.  Contrary to the suggestion in the Court&#x92;s opinion, 
				<em>
					McClurg 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>

				1 How. 202 (1843), did not involve the &#x93;legislative expansion&#x94; of an existing patent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10&#x96;11. The question in that case was whether the former employer of the inventor, one James Harley, could be held liable as an infringer for continuing to use the process that Harley had invented in 1834 when he was in its employ.  The Court first held that the employer&#x92;s use of the process before the patent issued was not a public use that would invalidate the patent, even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.  1 How., at 206&#x96;208.  The Court then disposed of the case on the ground that a statute enacted in 1839 protected the alleged infringer&#x92;s right to continue to use the process after the patent issued.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 209&#x96;211.  Our opinion said nothing about the power of Congress to extend the life of an issued patent.  It did note that Congress has plenary power to legislate on the subject of patents provided &#x93;that they do not take away the rights of property in existing patents.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 206.  The fact that Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee is, of course, fully consistent with the view that it cannot enlarge the patent monopoly to the detriment of the public after a patent has issued.

				The history of retroactive extensions of existing and expired copyrights and patents, though relevant, is not conclusive of the constitutionality of the Sonny Bono Act.

				Respondent also argues that the Act promotes the useful arts by providing incentives to restore old movies.  For at least three reasons, the interest in preserving perishable copies of old copyrighted films does not justify a wholesale extension of existing copyrights.  First, such restoration and preservation will not even arguably promote any new works by authors or inventors.  And, of course, any original expression in the restoration and preservation of movies will receive new copyright protection.

            </a>
				  Second, however strong the justification for preserving such works may be, that justification applies equally to works whose copyrights have already expired.  Yet no one seriously contends that the Copyright/Patent Clause would authorize the grant of monopoly privileges for works already in the public domain solely to encourage their restoration.  Finally, even if this concern with aging movies would permit congressional protection, the remedy offered&#x97;a blanket extension of all copyrights&#x97;simply bears no relationship to the alleged harm.

        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Finally, respondent relies on concerns of equity to justify the retroactive extension.  If Congress concludes that a longer period of exclusivity is necessary in order to provide an adequate incentive to authors to produce new works, respondent seems to believe that simple fairness requires that the same lengthened period be provided to authors whose works have already been completed and copyrighted.  This is a classic non sequitur.  The reason for increasing the inducement to create something new simply does not apply to an already-created work.  To the contrary, the equity argument actually provides strong support for petitioners.  Members of the public were entitled to rely on a promised access to copyrighted or patented works at the expiration of the terms specified when the exclusive privileges were granted.  On the other hand, authors will receive the full benefit of the exclusive terms that were promised as an inducement to their creativity, and have no equitable claim to increased compensation for doing nothing more.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				One must indulge in two untenable assumptions to find support in the equitable argument offered by respondent&#x97;that the public interest in free access to copyrighted works is entirely worthless and that authors, as a class, should receive a windfall solely based on completed creative activity.  Indeed, Congress has apparently indulged in those assumptions for under the series of extensions to copyrights, only one year&#x92;s worth of creative work&#x97;that copyrighted in 1923&#x97;has fallen into the public domain during the last 80 years.  But as our cases repeatedly and consistently emphasize, ultimate public access is the overriding purpose of the constitutional provision.  See,

				The express grant of a perpetual copyright would unquestionably violate the textual requirement that the authors&#x92; exclusive rights be only &#x93;for limited Times.&#x94;  Whether the extraordinary length of the grants authorized by the 1998 Act are invalid because they are the functional equivalent of perpetual copyrights is a question that need not be answered in this case because the question presented by the certiorari petition merely challenges Congress&#x92; power to extend retroactively the terms of existing copyrights.  Accordingly, there is no need to determine whether the deference that is normally given to congressional policy judgments may save from judicial review its decision respecting the appropriate length of the term.

				  It is important to note, however, that a categorical rule prohibiting retroactive extensions would effectively preclude perpetual copyrights.  More importantly, as the House of Lords recognized when it refused to amend the Statute of Anne in 1735, unless the Clause is construed to embody such a categorical rule, Congress may extend existing monopoly privileges

				By failing to protect the public interest in free access to the products of inventive and artistic genius&#x97;indeed, by virtually ignoring the central purpose of the Copyright/Patent Clause&#x97;the Court has quitclaimed to Congress its principal responsibility in this area of the law.  Fairly read, the Court has stated that Congress&#x92; actions under the Copyright/Patent Clause are, for all intents and purposes, judicially unreviewable.  That result cannot be squared with the basic tenets of our constitutional structure.

						 Justice Harlan wrote a brief concurrence, but did not disagree with this statement.  Justice Black&#x92;s statement echoed a portion of Attorney General Wirt&#x92;s argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 171 (1824): &#x93;The law of Congress declares, that all inventors of useful improvements throughout the United States, shall be entitled to the exclusive right in their discoveries for fourteen years only.  The law of New-York declares, that this inventor shall be entitled to the exclusive use of his discovery for thirty years, and as much longer as the State shall permit.  The law of Congress, by limiting the exclusive right to fourteen years, in effect declares, that after the expiration of that time, the discovery shall be the common right of the whole people of the United States.&#x94;

						Attorney General Wirt made this precise point in his argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 175: &#x93;The limitation is not for the advantage of the inventor, but of society at large, which is to take the benefit of the invention after the period of limitation has expired.  The patentee pays a duty on his patent, which is an effective source of revenue to the United States.  It is virtually a contract between each patentee and the people of the United States, by which the time of exclusive and secure enjoyment is limited, and then the benefit of the discovery results to the public.&#x94;

						The Court acknowledges that this proposition is &#x93;uncontroversial&#x94; today, see ante, at 11, n. 6, but overlooks the fact that it was highly controversial in the early 1800&#x92;s.  See n. 11, infra.  The Court assumes that the Sears holding rested entirely on the pre-emptive effect of congressional statutes even though the opinion itself, like the opinions  in Graham v.

						 &#x93;Your idea of appropriating a district of territory to the encouragement of imported inventions is new and worthy of consideration.  I can not but apprehend however that the clause in the constitution which forbids patents for that purpose will lie equally in the way of your expedient.  Congress seem to be tied down to the single mode of encouraging inventions by granting the exclusive benefit of them for a limited time, and therefore to have no more power to give a further encouragement out of a fund of land than a fund of money.  This fetter on the National Legislature tho&#x92; an unfortunate one, was a deliberate one.  The Latitude of authority now wished for was strongly urged and expressly rejected.&#x94;  Madison&#x92;s description of the Copyright/Patent Clause as a &#x93;fetter on the National Legislature&#x94; is fully consistent with this Court&#x92;s opinion in Graham.

						 Importantly, even this first Act required a quid pro quo in order to receive federal copyright protection.  In order to receive protection under the Act, the author was first required to register the work: &#x93;That no person shall be entitled to the benefit of this act, in cases where any map, chart, book or books, hath or have been already printed and published, unless he shall first deposit, and in all other cases, unless he shall before publication deposit a printed copy of the title of such map, chart, book or books, in the clerk&#x92;s office of the district court where the author or proprietor shall reside.&#x94; &#xA7;3,

						 In the period before our decision in Wheaton, the pre-emptive effect of the Patent/Copyright Clause was also a matter of serious debate within the legal profession. Indeed, in their argument in this Court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 44&#x96;61, 141&#x96;157, the defenders of New York&#x92;s grant of a 30-year monopoly on the passenger trade between New Jersey and Manhattan argued that the Clause actually should be interpreted as confirming the State&#x92;s authority to grant monopoly privileges that supplemented any federal grant. That argument is, of course, flatly inconsistent with our recent unanimous decision in Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S 141 (1989).  Although Attorney General Wirt had urged the Court to endorse our present interpretation of the Clause, its implicit limitations were unsettled when the 1831 Copyright Act was passed.

						  It is true, as the majority points out, ante at 11, n. 5, that Graham did not expressly overrule those earlier cases because Graham did not address the issue whether Congress could revive expired patents. That observation does not even arguably justify reliance on a set of old circuit court cases to support a proposition that is inconsistent with our present understanding of the limits imposed by the Copyright/Patent Clause.  After all, a unanimous Court recently endorsed the precise analysis that the majority now seeks to characterize as &#x93;wishful thinking.&#x94;  Ante, at 11, n. 5.  See Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;Congress may not create patent monopolies of unlimited duration, nor may it &#x91;authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain, or to restrict free access to materials already available&#x92; &#x94; (quoting Graham, 383 U.

						 Similarly, the validity of earlier retroactive extensions of copyright protection is not at issue in this case.  To decide the question now presented, we need not consider whether the reliance and expectation interests that have been established by prior extensions passed years ago would alter the result.  Cf. Heckler v. Mathews, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/465/728" class="subref" title="subref">465 U. S. 728</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">746</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;We have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting reasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an unconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time&#x94;).  Those interests are not at issue now, because the act under review in this case was passed only four years ago and has been under challenge in court since shortly after its enactment.

				  As I shall explain, the reasons why a State may not extend the life of a patent apply to Congress as well.  If Congress may not expand the scope of a patent monopoly, it also may not extend the life of a copyright beyond its expiration date.  Accordingly, insofar as the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.
2827, purported to extend the life of unexpired copyrights, it is invalid.  Because the majority&#x92;s contrary conclusion rests on the mistaken premise that this Court has virtually no role in reviewing congressional grants of monopoly privileges to authors, inventors and their successors, I respectfully dissent.

If an inventor should be permitted to hold back from the knowledge of the public the secrets of his invention; if he should for a long period of years retain the monopoly, and make, and sell his invention publicly, and thus gather the whole profits of it, relying upon his superior skill and knowledge of the structure; and then, and then only, when the danger of competition should force him to secure the exclusive right, he should be allowed to take out a patent, and thus exclude the public from any farther use than what should be derived under it during his fourteen years; it would materially retard the progress of science and the useful arts, and give a premium to those, who should be least prompt to communicate their discoveries.&#x94;

 (&#x93;[T]he patent system represents a carefully crafted bargain that encourages both the creation and the public disclosure of new and useful advances in technology, in return for an exclusive monopoly for a limited period of time&#x94;).  It would be manifestly unfair if, after issuing a patent, the Government as a representative of the public sought to modify the bargain by shortening the term of the patent in order to accelerate public access to the invention.  The fairness considerations that underlie the constitutional protections against 
				<em>
					ex post facto
				</em>
				 laws and laws impairing the obligation of contracts would presumably disable Congress from making such a retroactive change in the public&#x92;s bargain with an inventor without providing compensation for the taking.  Those same considerations should protect members of the public who make plans to exploit an invention as soon as it enters the public domain from a retroactive modification of the bargain that extends the term of the patent monopoly.  As I discuss below, the few historical exceptions to this rule do not undermine the constitutional analysis.  For quite plainly, the limitations &#x93;implicit in the Patent Clause itself,&#x94; 489 U. S., at 151, adequately explain why neither a State nor Congress may &#x93;extend the life of a patent beyond its expiration date,&#x94;

				 extensions of copyrights result in a gratuitous transfer of wealth from the public to authors, publishers, and their successors in interest.  Such retroactive extensions do not even arguably serve either of the purposes of the Copyright/Patent Clause.  The reasons why such extensions of the patent monopoly are unconstitutional apply to copyrights as well.

				Respondent, however, advances four arguments in support of the constitutionality of such retroactive extensions: (1) the first Copyright Act enacted shortly after the Constitution was ratified applied to works that had already been produced; (2) later Congresses have repeatedly authorized extensions of copyrights and patents; (3) such extensions promote the useful arts by giving copyright holders an incentive to preserve and restore certain valuable motion pictures; and (4) as a matter of equity, whenever Congress provides a longer term as an incentive to the creation of new works by authors, it should provide an equivalent reward to the owners of all unexpired copyrights.  None of these arguments is persuasive.

This statutory omission, coupled with the contemporaneous statements by legislators, provides strong evidence that Congress recognized significant limitations on their constitutional authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause to extend protection to a class of intellectual properties.  This recognition of a categorical constitutional limitation is fundamentally at odds with the majority&#x92;s reading of Article I, &#xA7;8 to provide essentially no limit on congressional action under the Clause.

				Congress also passed the first Copyright Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124, in 1790.  At that time there were a number of maps, charts, and books that had already been printed, some of which were copyrighted under state laws and some of which were arguably entitled to perpetual protection under the common law.  The federal statute applied to those works as well as to new works.  In some cases the application of the new federal rule reduced the pre-existing protections, and in others it may have increased the protection.  What is significant is that the statute provided a general rule creating new federal rights that supplanted the diverse state rights that previously existed.  It did not extend or attach to any of those pre-existing state and common-law rights: &#x93;That congress, in passing the act of 1790, did not legislate in reference to existing rights, appears clear.&#x94;  Wheaton

 (&#x93;As this Court has repeatedly said, the Congress did not sanction an existing right but created a new one&#x94;).  Congress set in place a federal structure governing certain types of intellectual property for the new Republic.  That Congress exercised its unquestionable constitutional authority to

				  Precisely put, the question presented by this case does not even implicate the 1790 Act, for that Act created, rather than extended, copyright protection.

				Moreover, members of Congress in 1790 were well aware of the distinction between the creation of new copyright regimes and the extension of existing copyrights.  The 1790 Act was patterned, in many ways, after the Statute of Anne enacted in England in 1710.  8 Ann., c. 19; see

.  The English statute, in addition to providing authors with copyrights on new works for a term of 14 years renewable for another 14-year term, also replaced the booksellers&#x92; claimed perpetual rights in existing works with a single 21-year term.

				Since the creation of federal patent and copyright protection in 1790, Congress has passed a variety of legislation, both providing specific relief for individual authors and inventors as well as changing the general statutes conferring patent and copyright privileges.  Some of the changes did indeed, as the majority describes, extend existing protections retroactively.  Other changes, however, did not do so.  A more complete and comprehensive look at the history of congressional action under the

				The first example relied upon by respondent, the extension of Oliver Evans&#x92; patent in 1808, ch. 8, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70, demonstrates the pitfalls of relying on an incomplete historical analysis.  Evans, an inventor who had developed several improvements in milling flour, received the third federal patent on January 7, 1791.  See Federico, Patent Trials of Oliver Evans, 27 J. Pat. Off. Soc. 586, 590 (1945).  Under the 14-year term provided by the 1790 Patent Act, this patent was to expire on January 7, 1805.  Claiming that 14 years had not provided him a sufficient time to realize income from his invention and that the net profits were spent developing improvements on the steam engine, Evans first sought an extension of his patent in December 1804.  
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 598; 14 Annals of Congress 1002.  Unsuccessful in 1804, he tried again in 1805, and yet again in 1806, to persuade Congress to pass his private bill.  Undaunted, Evans tried one last time to revive his expired patent after receiving an adverse judgment in an infringement action.  See

				v. 
				<em>

				, 8 F. Cas. 837 (No. 4,555) (CC Pa. 1807).  This time, his effort at private legislation was successful and Congress passed a bill extending his patent for 14 years.  See An Act for the relief of Oliver Evans, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">6</a>Stat.
70.  This legislation, passed January 21, 1808, restored a patent monopoly for an invention that had been in the public domain for over four years.  As such, this Act unquestionably exceeded Congress&#x92; authority under the Copyright/Patent Clause: &#x93;The Congress in the exercise of the patent power may not overreach the restraints imposed by the stated constitutional purpose. &#x2026;

				This extension of patent protection to an expired patent was not an isolated incident.  Congress passed private bills either directly extending patents or allowing otherwise untimely applicants to apply for patent extensions for approximately 75 patents between 1790 and 1875.  Of these 75 patents, at least 56 had already fallen into the public domain.

				Copyright legislation has a similar history.  The federal Copyright Act was first amended in 1831. That amendment, like later amendments, not only authorized a longer term for new works, but also extended the terms of unexpired copyrights.  Respondent argues that that historical practice effectively establishes the constitutionality of retroactive extensions of unexpired copyrights.  Of course, the practice buttressess the presumption of validity that attaches to every Act of Congress.  But, as our decision in

				It would be particularly unwise to attach constitutional significance to the 1831 amendment because of the very different legal landscape against which it was enacted.  Congress based its authority to pass the amendment on grounds shortly thereafter declared improper by the Court.  The Judiciary Committee Report prepared for the House of Representatives asserted that &#x93;an author has an exclusive and perpetual right, in preference to any other, to the fruits of his labor.&#x94;  7 Gales &amp; Seaton, Register of Debates in Congress cxx (1831).

				In 1861, Congress amended the term of patents, from a 14-year term plus opportunity for 7-year extension to a flat 17 years with no extension permitted.  Act of Mar. 2, 1861, ch. 88, &#xA7;16,

				  To be sure, Congress, at many times in its history, has retroactively extended the terms of existing copyrights and patents.

				The general presumption that historic practice illuminates the constitutionality of congressional action is not controlling in this case.  That presumption is strongest when the earliest acts of Congress are considered, for the overlap of identity between those who created the Constitution and those who first constituted Congress provides &#x93;contemporaneous and weighty evidence&#x94; of the Constitution&#x92;s &#x93;true meaning.&#x94;

				The majority&#x92;s reliance on the other patent case it cites is similarly misplaced.  Contrary to the suggestion in the Court&#x92;s opinion, 
				<em>
					McClurg 
				</em>
				v. 
				<em>
					Kingsland, 
				</em>
				1 How. 202 (1843), did not involve the &#x93;legislative expansion&#x94; of an existing patent.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 10&#x96;11. The question in that case was whether the former employer of the inventor, one James Harley, could be held liable as an infringer for continuing to use the process that Harley had invented in 1834 when he was in its employ.  The Court first held that the employer&#x92;s use of the process before the patent issued was not a public use that would invalidate the patent, even if it might have had that effect prior to the amendment of the patent statute in 1836.  1 How., at 206&#x96;208.  The Court then disposed of the case on the ground that a statute enacted in 1839 protected the alleged infringer&#x92;s right to continue to use the process after the patent issued.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 209&#x96;211.  Our opinion said nothing about the power of Congress to extend the life of an issued patent.  It did note that Congress has plenary power to legislate on the subject of patents provided &#x93;that they do not take away the rights of property in existing patents.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 206.  The fact that Congress cannot change the bargain between the public and the patentee in a way that disadvantages the patentee is, of course, fully consistent with the view that it cannot enlarge the patent monopoly to the detriment of the public after a patent has issued.

				Respondent also argues that the Act promotes the useful arts by providing incentives to restore old movies.  For at least three reasons, the interest in preserving perishable copies of old copyrighted films does not justify a wholesale extension of existing copyrights.  First, such restoration and preservation will not even arguably promote any new works by authors or inventors.  And, of course, any original expression in the restoration and preservation of movies will receive new copyright protection.

            </a>
				  Second, however strong the justification for preserving such works may be, that justification applies equally to works whose copyrights have already expired.  Yet no one seriously contends that the Copyright/Patent Clause would authorize the grant of monopoly privileges for works already in the public domain solely to encourage their restoration.  Finally, even if this concern with aging movies would permit congressional protection, the remedy offered&#x97;a blanket extension of all copyrights&#x97;simply bears no relationship to the alleged harm.

        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Finally, respondent relies on concerns of equity to justify the retroactive extension.  If Congress concludes that a longer period of exclusivity is necessary in order to provide an adequate incentive to authors to produce new works, respondent seems to believe that simple fairness requires that the same lengthened period be provided to authors whose works have already been completed and copyrighted.  This is a classic non sequitur.  The reason for increasing the inducement to create something new simply does not apply to an already-created work.  To the contrary, the equity argument actually provides strong support for petitioners.  Members of the public were entitled to rely on a promised access to copyrighted or patented works at the expiration of the terms specified when the exclusive privileges were granted.  On the other hand, authors will receive the full benefit of the exclusive terms that were promised as an inducement to their creativity, and have no equitable claim to increased compensation for doing nothing more.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				One must indulge in two untenable assumptions to find support in the equitable argument offered by respondent&#x97;that the public interest in free access to copyrighted works is entirely worthless and that authors, as a class, should receive a windfall solely based on completed creative activity.  Indeed, Congress has apparently indulged in those assumptions for under the series of extensions to copyrights, only one year&#x92;s worth of creative work&#x97;that copyrighted in 1923&#x97;has fallen into the public domain during the last 80 years.  But as our cases repeatedly and consistently emphasize, ultimate public access is the overriding purpose of the constitutional provision.  See,

            <em>
					Sony Corp.,

				The express grant of a perpetual copyright would unquestionably violate the textual requirement that the authors&#x92; exclusive rights be only &#x93;for limited Times.&#x94;  Whether the extraordinary length of the grants authorized by the 1998 Act are invalid because they are the functional equivalent of perpetual copyrights is a question that need not be answered in this case because the question presented by the certiorari petition merely challenges Congress&#x92; power to extend retroactively the terms of existing copyrights.  Accordingly, there is no need to determine whether the deference that is normally given to congressional policy judgments may save from judicial review its decision respecting the appropriate length of the term.

				  It is important to note, however, that a categorical rule prohibiting retroactive extensions would effectively preclude perpetual copyrights.

						 Justice Harlan wrote a brief concurrence, but did not disagree with this statement.  Justice Black&#x92;s statement echoed a portion of Attorney General Wirt&#x92;s argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 171 (1824): &#x93;The law of Congress declares, that all inventors of useful improvements throughout the United States, shall be entitled to the exclusive right in their discoveries for fourteen years only.  The law of New-York declares, that this inventor shall be entitled to the exclusive use of his discovery for thirty years, and as much longer as the State shall permit.  The law of Congress, by limiting the exclusive right to fourteen years, in effect declares, that after the expiration of that time, the discovery shall be the common right of the whole people of the United States.&#x94;

						Attorney General Wirt made this precise point in his argument in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 175: &#x93;The limitation is not for the advantage of the inventor, but of society at large, which is to take the benefit of the invention after the period of limitation has expired.  The patentee pays a duty on his patent, which is an effective source of revenue to the United States.  It is virtually a contract between each patentee and the people of the United States, by which the time of exclusive and secure enjoyment is limited, and then the benefit of the discovery results to the public.&#x94;

Congress seem to be tied down to the single mode of encouraging inventions by granting the exclusive benefit of them for a limited time, and therefore to have no more power to give a further encouragement out of a fund of land than a fund of money.  This fetter on the National Legislature tho&#x92; an unfortunate one, was a deliberate one.  The Latitude of authority now wished for was strongly urged and expressly rejected.&#x94;  Madison&#x92;s description of the Copyright/Patent Clause as a &#x93;fetter on the National Legislature&#x94; is fully consistent with this Court&#x92;s opinion in Graham.

						 Importantly, even this first Act required a quid pro quo in order to receive federal copyright protection.  In order to receive protection under the Act, the author was first required to register the work: &#x93;That no person shall be entitled to the benefit of this act, in cases where any map, chart, book or books, hath or have been already printed and published, unless he shall first deposit, and in all other cases, unless he shall before publication deposit a printed copy of the title of such map, chart, book or books, in the clerk&#x92;s office of the district court where the author or proprietor shall reside.&#x94; &#xA7;3, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">1</a>Stat.
124.  This registration requirement in federal district court&#x97;a requirement obviously not required under the various state laws protecting written works&#x97;further illustrates that the 1790 Act created new rights, rather than extending existing rights.

						 Respondent&#x92;s reformulation of the questions presented by this case confuses this basic distinction.  We granted certiorari to consider the question: &#x93;Did the D. C. Circuit err in holding that Congress has the power under the Copyright Clause to extend retroactively the term of existing copyrights?&#x94;  Respondent&#x92;s reformulation of the first question presented&#x97;&#x93;Whether the 20-year extension of the terms of all unexpired copyrights . . . violates the Copyright Clause of the Constitution insofar as it applies to works in existence when it took effect&#x94;&#x97;significantly changes the substance of inquiry by changing the focus from the federal statute at issue to irrelevant common-law protections.  Brief for Respondent I.  Indeed, this reformulation violated this Court&#x92;s Rule 24(1)(a), which states that &#x93;the brief [on the merits] may not raise additional questions or change the substance of the questions already presented in&#x94; the petition for certiorari.

						 In the period before our decision in Wheaton, the pre-emptive effect of the Patent/Copyright Clause was also a matter of serious debate within the legal profession. Indeed, in their argument in this Court in Gibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat., at 44&#x96;61, 141&#x96;157, the defenders of New York&#x92;s grant of a 30-year monopoly on the passenger trade between New Jersey and Manhattan argued that the Clause actually should be interpreted as confirming the State&#x92;s authority to grant monopoly privileges that supplemented any federal grant. That argument is, of course, flatly inconsistent with our recent unanimous decision in Bonito Boats v. Thundercraft Boats, Inc., 489 U. S 141 (1989).  Although Attorney General Wirt had urged the Court to endorse our present interpretation of the Clause, its implicit limitations were unsettled when the 1831 Copyright Act was passed.

						  It is true, as the majority points out, ante at 11, n. 5, that Graham did not expressly overrule those earlier cases because Graham did not address the issue whether Congress could revive expired patents. That observation does not even arguably justify reliance on a set of old circuit court cases to support a proposition that is inconsistent with our present understanding of the limits imposed by the Copyright/Patent Clause.  After all, a unanimous Court recently endorsed the precise analysis that the majority now seeks to characterize as &#x93;wishful thinking.&#x94;  Ante, at 11, n. 5.  See Bonito Boats, 489 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;Congress may not create patent monopolies of unlimited duration, nor may it &#x91;authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain, or to restrict free access to materials already available&#x92; &#x94; (quoting Graham, 383 U. S., at 6 )).

						 Indeed, the Lodging of the Motion Picture Association of America, Inc., as Amicus Curiae illustrates the significant creative work involved in releasing these classics.  The Casablanca Digital Video Disc (DVD) contains a &#x93;documentary You Must Remember This, hosted by Lauren Bacall and featuring recently unearthed outtakes&#x94; and an &#x93;[a]ll-new introduction by Lauren Bacall.&#x94;  Disc cover text.  Similarly, the Citizen Kane DVD includes &#x93;[t]wo feature-length audio commentaries: one by film critic Roger Ebert and the other by director/Welles biographer Peter Bogdanovich&#x94; and a &#x93;gallery of storyboards, rare photos, alternate ad campaigns, studio correspondence, call sheets and other memorabilia&#x94; in addition to a 2-hour documentary.

						 Similarly, the validity of earlier retroactive extensions of copyright protection is not at issue in this case.  To decide the question now presented, we need not consider whether the reliance and expectation interests that have been established by prior extensions passed years ago would alter the result.  Cf. Heckler v. Mathews, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/465/728" class="subref" title="subref">465 U. S. 728</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">746</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;We have recognized, in a number of contexts, the legitimacy of protecting reasonable reliance on prior law even when that requires allowing an unconstitutional statute to remain in effect for a limited period of time&#x94;).  Those interests are not at issue now, because the act under review in this case was passed only four years ago and has been under challenge in court since shortly after its enactment.
