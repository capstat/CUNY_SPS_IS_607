            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Thomas</span> delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In this case, we decide whether a federal court of appeals has jurisdiction to review a district court&#x92;s order that remands a case to state court after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1367.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;1367(c)</a>.  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that appellate review of such an order is barred by &#xA7;1447(d) because it viewed the remand order in this case as resting on the District Court&#x92;s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over the state-law claims.  We disagree and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In 2005, respondents filed a complaint against petitioner and others in California state court, alleging that petitioner had violated state and federal law in connection with a patent dispute.  Petitioner removed the case to the United States District Court for the Central District of California pursuant to &#xA7;1441(c), which allows removal of an &#x93;entire case&#x94; when it includes at least one claim over which the federal district court has original jurisdiction.  Petitioner then filed a motion to dismiss the only federal claim in the lawsuit, which arose under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1961-196.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;1961&#x96;196</a>8, for failure to adequately allege a pattern of racketeering.  <em>HIF Bio, Inc.</em> v. <em>Yung Shin Pharmaceuticals Indus. Co.</em>, 508 F. 3d 659, 662 (CA Fed. 2007).  The District Court agreed that respondents had failed to state a RICO claim upon which relief could be granted and dismissed the claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  The District Court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims pursuant to 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1367.html#c_3" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;1367(c)(3)</a>, which provides that a district court &#x93;may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim&#x94; if &#x93;the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.&#x94;  The District Court then remanded the case to state court as authorized by this Court&#x92;s decision in <em>Carnegie-Mellon Univ.</em> v. <em>Cohill</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/484/343" class="subref" title="subref">484 U. S. 343</a> (1988)
.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, arguing that the District Court should have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims because they implicate federal patent-law rights.  508 F. 3d, at 663.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, finding that the remand order could &#x93;be colorably characterized as a remand based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction&#x94; and, therefore, could not be reviewed under &#xA7;&#xA7;1447(c) and (d), which provide in part that remands for &#x93;lack of subject matter jurisdiction&#x94; are &#x93;not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.&#x94;  See <em>id.,</em> at 667.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This Court has not yet decided whether a district court&#x92;s order remanding a case to state court after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is a remand for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction for which appellate review is barred by &#xA7;&#xA7;1447(c) and (d).  See <em>Powerex Corp.</em> v. <em>Reliant Energy Services, Inc.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/551/224" class="subref" title="subref">551 U. S. 224</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">235</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">4</a> (2007)
 (&#x93;We have never passed on whether <em>Cohill</em> remands are subject-matter jurisdictional for purposes of &#x2026; &#xA7;1447(c) and &#xA7;1447(d)&#x94;).  We granted certiorari to resolve this question, 555 U. S. ___ (2008), and now hold that such remand orders are not based on a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    In this case, we decide whether a federal court of appeals has jurisdiction to review a district court&#x92;s order that remands a case to state court after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims under

        <p class="bodytext">    In 2005, respondents filed a complaint against petitioner and others in California state court, alleging that petitioner had violated state and federal law in connection with a patent dispute.  Petitioner removed the case to the United States District Court for the Central District of California pursuant to &#xA7;1441(c), which allows removal of an &#x93;entire case&#x94; when it includes at least one claim over which the federal district court has original jurisdiction.  Petitioner then filed a motion to dismiss the only federal claim in the lawsuit, which arose under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),

Co.</em>, 508 F. 3d 659, 662 (CA Fed. 2007).  The District Court agreed that respondents had failed to state a RICO claim upon which relief could be granted and dismissed the claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  The District Court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims pursuant to

        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, arguing that the District Court should have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims because they implicate federal patent-law rights.  508 F. 3d, at 663.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, finding that the remand order could &#x93;be colorably characterized as a remand based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction&#x94; and, therefore, could not be reviewed under &#xA7;&#xA7;1447(c) and (d), which provide in part that remands for &#x93;lack of subject matter jurisdiction&#x94; are &#x93;not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.&#x94;  See <em>id.,</em> at 667.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This Court has not yet decided whether a district court&#x92;s order remanding a case to state court after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is a remand for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction for which appellate review is barred by &#xA7;&#xA7;1447(c) and (d).

        <p class="bodytext">    In 2005, respondents filed a complaint against petitioner and others in California state court, alleging that petitioner had violated state and federal law in connection with a patent dispute.  Petitioner removed the case to the United States District Court for the Central District of California pursuant to &#xA7;1441(c), which allows removal of an &#x93;entire case&#x94; when it includes at least one claim over which the federal district court has original jurisdiction.  Petitioner then filed a motion to dismiss the only federal claim in the lawsuit, which arose under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO),

The District Court agreed that respondents had failed to state a RICO claim upon which relief could be granted and dismissed the claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).

        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, arguing that the District Court should have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims because they implicate federal patent-law rights.  508 F. 3d, at 663.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, finding that the remand order could &#x93;be colorably characterized as a remand based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction&#x94; and, therefore, could not be reviewed under &#xA7;&#xA7;1447(c) and (d), which provide in part that remands for &#x93;lack of subject matter jurisdiction&#x94; are &#x93;not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.&#x94;  See <em>id.,</em> at 667.</p>

The question presented in this case is whether the District Court&#x92;s remand order, which rested on its decision declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over respondents&#x92; state-law claims, is a remand based on a &#x93;lack of subject matter jurisdiction&#x94; for purposes of &#xA7;&#xA7;1447(c) and (d).

See, <em>e.g., Quackenbush</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 712 (holding that an abstention-based remand is not a remand for &#x93;lack of subject matter jurisdiction&#x94; for purposes of &#xA7;&#xA7;1447(c) and (d)); <em>Ankenbrandt</em> v. <em>Richards</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    With respect to supplemental jurisdiction in particular, a federal court has subject-matter jurisdiction over specified state-law claims, which it may (or may not) choose to exercise.  See &#xA7;&#xA7;1367(a), (c).  A district court&#x92;s decision whether to exercise that jurisdiction after dismissing every claim over which it had original jurisdiction is purely discretionary.  See &#xA7;1367(c) (&#x93;The district courts <em>may</em> decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim &#x2026; if &#x2026; the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction&#x94; (emphasis added));  <em>Osborn</em> v. <em>Haley</em>,

 (&#x93;[W]hen a court grants a motion to dismiss for failure to state a federal claim, the court generally retains discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction, pursuant to

The district court retains discretion to exercise supplemental jurisdiction [over them]&#x94;).  As a result, &#x93;the [district] court&#x92;s exercise of its discretion under &#xA7;1367(c) is not a jurisdictional matter.  Thus, the court&#x92;s determination may be reviewed for abuse of discretion, but may not be raised at any time as a jurisdictional defect.&#x94;  16 J.

Upon dismissal of the federal claim, the District Court retained its statutory supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims.  Its decision declining to exercise that statutory authority was not based on a jurisdictional defect but on its discretionary choice not to hear the claims despite its subject-matter jurisdiction over them.

        <p class="bodytext">    In this case, we decide whether a federal court of appeals has jurisdiction to review a district court&#x92;s order that remands a case to state court after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state-law claims under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1367.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;1367(c)</a>.  The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit held that appellate review of such an order is barred by &#xA7;1447(d) because it viewed the remand order in this case as resting on the District Court&#x92;s lack of subject-matter jurisdiction over the state-law claims.  We disagree and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    In 2005, respondents filed a complaint against petitioner and others in California state court, alleging that petitioner had violated state and federal law in connection with a patent dispute.  Petitioner removed the case to the United States District Court for the Central District of California pursuant to &#xA7;1441(c), which allows removal of an &#x93;entire case&#x94; when it includes at least one claim over which the federal district court has original jurisdiction.  Petitioner then filed a motion to dismiss the only federal claim in the lawsuit, which arose under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/1961-196.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;1961&#x96;196</a>8, for failure to adequately allege a pattern of racketeering.  <em>HIF Bio, Inc.</em> v. <em>Yung Shin Pharmaceuticals Indus. Co.</em>, 508 F. 3d 659, 662 (CA Fed. 2007).  The District Court agreed that respondents had failed to state a RICO claim upon which relief could be granted and dismissed the claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  The District Court also declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state-law claims pursuant to 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1367.html#c_3" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;1367(c)(3)</a>, which provides that a district court &#x93;may decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over a claim&#x94; if &#x93;the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original jurisdiction.&#x94;  The District Court then remanded the case to state court as authorized by this Court&#x92;s decision in <em>Carnegie-Mellon Univ.</em> v. <em>Cohill</em>,

.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, arguing that the District Court should have exercised supplemental jurisdiction over the state-law claims because they implicate federal patent-law rights.  508 F. 3d, at 663.  The Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal, finding that the remand order could &#x93;be colorably characterized as a remand based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction&#x94; and, therefore, could not be reviewed under &#xA7;&#xA7;1447(c) and (d), which provide in part that remands for &#x93;lack of subject matter jurisdiction&#x94; are &#x93;not reviewable on appeal or otherwise.&#x94;  See <em>id.,</em> at 667.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This Court has not yet decided whether a district court&#x92;s order remanding a case to state court after declining to exercise supplemental jurisdiction is a remand for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction for which appellate review is barred by &#xA7;&#xA7;1447(c) and (d).

 (&#x93;We have never passed on whether <em>Cohill</em> remands are subject-matter jurisdictional for purposes of &#x2026; &#xA7;1447(c) and &#xA7;1447(d)&#x94;).  We granted certiorari to resolve this question, 555 U. S. ___ (2008), and now hold that such remand orders are not based on a lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for further proceedings.</p>

This Court has consistently held that &#xA7;1447(d) must be read <em>in pari materia </em>with &#xA7;1447(c), thus limiting the remands barred from appellate review by &#xA7;1447(d) to those that are based on a ground specified in &#xA7;1447(c).

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-*" href="#ZO-*ref">*</a>* We do not revisit today whether Thermtron was correctly decided.  Neither the brief for petitioner nor the brief for respondents explicitly asked the Court to do so here, and counsel for both parties clearly stated at oral argument that they were not asking for Thermtron to be overruled.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16, 22; cf. South Central Bell Telephone Co. v. Alabama,

.  We also note that the parties in Powerex, Quackenbush, and Things Remembered did not ask for Thermtron to be overruled.
