				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/844" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 844</a>, this Court found that the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA)&#x97;Congress&#x92; first attempt to protect children from exposure to pornographic material on the Internet&#x97;ran afoul of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> in its regulation of indecent transmissions and the display of patently offensive material.  That conclusion was based, in part, on the crucial consideration that the CDA&#x92;s breadth was wholly unprecedented.  After the Court&#x92;s decision in 
				<em>
					Reno
				</em>
				, Congress attempted to address this concern in the Child Online Protection Act (COPA).  Unlike the CDA, COPA applies only to material displayed on the World Wide Web, covers only communications made for commercial purposes, and restricts only &#x93;material that is harmful to minors,&#x94; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#a_1" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(a)(1)</a>.  In defining &#x93;material that is harmful to minors,&#x94; COPA draws on the three-part obscenity test set forth in

				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U.

Respondents&#x97;who post or have members that post sexually oriented material on the Web&#x97;filed a facial challenge before COPA went into effect, claiming, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, that the statute violated adults&#x92; 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights because it effectively banned constitutionally protected speech, was not the least restrictive means of accomplishing a compelling governmental purpose, and was substantially overbroad.  The District Court issued a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of COPA because it concluded that the statute was unlikely to survive strict scrutiny.  The Third Circuit affirmed but based its decision on a ground not relied upon by the District Court: that COPA&#x92;s use of &#x93;contemporary community standards,&#x94; &#xA7;231(e)(6)(A), to identify material that is harmful to minors rendered the statute substantially overbroad.

					Held:
				</em>
				 COPA&#x92;s reliance on &#x93;community standards&#x94; to identify what material &#x93;is harmful to minors&#x94; does not by itself render the statute substantially overbroad for 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> purposes.  The Court, however, expresses no view as to whether COPA suffers from substantial overbreadth for reasons other than its use of community standards, whether the statute is unconstitutionally vague, or whether the statute survives strict scrutiny.  Prudence dictates allowing the Third Circuit to first examine these difficult issues.  Because petitioner did not ask to have the preliminary injunction vacated, and because this Court could not do so without addressing matters the Third Circuit has yet to consider, the Government remains enjoined from enforcing COPA absent further action by the lower courts.

Supp. 2d, at 476 (&#x93;A child with minimal knowledge of a computer, the ability to operate a browser, and the skill to type a few simple words may be able to access sexual images and content over the World Wide Web&#x94;).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress first attempted to protect children from exposure to pornographic material on the Internet by enacting the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
133.  The CDA prohibited the knowing transmission over the Internet of obscene or indecent messages to any recipient under 18 years of age.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/223.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;223(a)</a>.  It also forbade any individual from knowingly sending over or displaying on the Internet certain &#x93;patently offensive&#x94; material in a manner available to persons under 18 years of age.  See &#xA7;223(d).  The prohibition specifically extended to &#x93;any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication that, in context, depict[ed] or describ[ed], in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs.&#x94;  &#xA7;223(d)(1).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The CDA provided two affirmative defenses to those prosecuted under the statute.  The first protected individuals who took &#x93;good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions&#x94; to restrict minors from accessing obscene, indecent, and patently offensive material over the Internet.  See &#xA7;223(e)(5)(A).  The second shielded those who restricted minors from accessing such material &#x93;by requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification number.&#x94;  &#xA7;223(e)(5)(B).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Notwithstanding these affirmative defenses, in 
				<em>
					Reno
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					American Civil Liberties Union
				</em>
				, we held that the CDA&#x92;s regulation of indecent transmissions, see &#xA7;223(a), and the display of patently offensive material, see &#xA7;223(d), ran afoul of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  We concluded that &#x93;the CDA lack[ed] the precision that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> requires when a statute regulates the content of speech&#x94; because, &#x93;[i]n order to deny minors access to potentially harmful speech, the CDA effectively suppress[ed] a large amount of speech that adults ha[d] a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 874.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our holding was based on three crucial considerations.  First, &#x93;existing technology did not include any effective method for a sender to prevent minors from obtaining access to its communications on the Internet without also denying access to adults.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 876.  Second, &#x93;[t]he breadth of the CDA&#x92;s coverage [was] wholly unprecedented.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 877.  &#x93;Its open-ended prohibitions embrace[d],&#x94; not only commercial speech or commercial entities, but also &#x93;all nonprofit entities and individuals posting indecent messages or displaying them on their own computers in the presence of minors.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  In addition, because the CDA did not define the terms &#x93;indecent&#x94; and &#x93;patently offensive,&#x94; the statute &#x93;cover[ed] large amounts of nonpornographic material with serious educational or other value.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  As a result, regulated subject matter under the CDA extended to &#x93;discussions about prison rape or safe sexual practices, artistic images that include nude subjects, and arguably the card catalog of the Carnegie Library.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 878.  Third, we found that neither affirmative defense set forth in the CDA &#x93;constitute[d] the sort of &#x91;narrow tailoring&#x92; that [would] save an otherwise patently invalid unconstitutional provision.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 882.  Consequently, only the CDA&#x92;s ban on the knowing transmission of obscene messages survived scrutiny because obscene speech enjoys no 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> protection.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 883.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After our decision in 
				<em>
					Reno
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					American Civil Liberties Union
				</em>
				, Congress explored other avenues for restricting minors&#x92; access to pornographic material on the Internet.  In particular, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Child Online Protection Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.
2681&#x96;
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				736 (codified in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231</a> (1994 ed., Supp. V)). COPA prohibits any person from &#x93;knowingly and with knowledge of the character of the material, in interstate or foreign commerce by means of the World Wide Web, mak[ing] any communication for commercial purposes that is available to any minor and that includes any material that is harmful to minors.&#x94;

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Apparently responding to our objections to the breadth of the CDA&#x92;s coverage, Congress limited the scope of COPA&#x92;s coverage in at least three ways.  First, while the CDA applied to communications over the Internet as a whole, including, for example, e-mail messages, COPA applies only to material displayed on the World Wide Web.  Second, unlike the CDA, COPA covers only communications made &#x93;for commercial purposes.&#x94;

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Like the CDA, COPA also provides affirmative defenses to those subject to prosecution under the statute.  An individual may qualify for a defense if he, &#x93;in good faith, has restricted access by minors to material that is harmful to minors&#x97;(A) by requiring the use of a credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification number; (B) by accepting a digital certificate that verifies age; or (C) by any other reasonable measures that are feasible under available technology.&#x94;  &#xA7;231(c)(1).  Persons violating COPA are subject to both civil and criminal sanctions.  A civil penalty of up to $50,000 may be imposed for each violation of the statute.  Criminal penalties consist of up to six months in prison and/or a maximum fine of $50,000.  An additional fine of $50,000 may be imposed for any intentional violation of the statute.  &#xA7;231(a).

Some, for example, sell advertising that is displayed on their Web sites, while others either sell goods directly over their sites or charge artists for the privilege of posting material.  31 F. Supp. 2d, at 487.  All respondents either post or have members that post sexually oriented material on the Web.

Focusing on respondents&#x92; claim that COPA abridged the free speech rights of adults, the District Court concluded that respondents had established a likelihood of success on the merits.

				The Attorney General of the United States appealed the District Court&#x92;s ruling.  
				<em>
					American Civil Liberties Union
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Reno,
				</em>
				 217 F. 3d 162 (CA3 2000).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.  Rather than reviewing the District Court&#x92;s &#x93;holding that COPA was not likely to succeed in surviving strict scrutiny analysis,&#x94; the Court of Appeals based its decision entirely on a ground that was not relied upon below and that was &#x93;virtually ignored by the parties and the amicus in their respective briefs.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 173&#x96;174.  The Court of Appeals concluded that COPA&#x92;s use of &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; to identify material that is harmful to minors rendered the statute substantially overbroad.  Because &#x93;Web publishers are without any means to limit access to their sites based on the geographic location of particular Internet users,&#x94; the Court of Appeals reasoned that COPA would require &#x93;any material that might be deemed harmful by the most puritan of communities in any state&#x94; to be placed behind an age or credit card verification system.

				<em>

				The Court of Appeals, however, concluded that this Court&#x92;s prior community standards jurisprudence &#x93;has no applicability to the Internet and the Web&#x94; because &#x93;Web publishers are currently without the ability to control the geographic scope of the recipients of their communications.&#x94;  217 F. 3d, at 180.

				In the context of this case, which involves a facial challenge to a statute that has never been enforced, we do not think it prudent to engage in speculation as to whether certain hypothetical jury instructions would or would not be consistent with COPA, and deciding this case does not require us to do so.

				 at 105.  Petitioner concedes the latter point, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 3&#x96;4, and admits that, even if jurors were instructed under COPA to apply the standards of the adult population as a whole, the variance in community standards across the country could still cause juries in different locations to reach inconsistent conclusions as to whether a particular work is &#x93;harmful to minors.&#x94;  Brief for Petitioner 39.

				Because juries would apply different standards across the country, and Web publishers currently lack the ability to limit access to their sites on a geographic basis, the Court of Appeals feared that COPA&#x92;s &#x93;community standards&#x94; component would effectively force all speakers on the Web to abide by the &#x93;most puritan&#x94; community&#x92;s standards.  217 F. 3d, at 175.

				In evaluating the constitutionality of the CDA, this Court expressed a similar concern over that statute&#x92;s use of community standards to identify patently offensive material on the Internet.  We noted that &#x93;the &#x91;community standards&#x92; criterion as applied to the Internet means that any communication available to a nationwide audience will be judged by the standards of the community most likely to be offended by the message.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Reno

				, 521 U. S., at 877&#x96;878.  The Court of Appeals below relied heavily on this observation, stating that it was &#x93;not persuaded that the Supreme Court&#x92;s concern with respect to the &#x91;community standards&#x92; criterion has been sufficiently remedied by Congress in COPA.&#x94;  217 F. 3d, at 174.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The CDA&#x92;s use of community standards to identify patently offensive material, however, was particularly problematic in light of that statute&#x92;s unprecedented breadth and vagueness.  The statute covered communications depicting or describing &#x93;sexual or excretory activities or organs&#x94; that were &#x93;patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards&#x94;&#x97;a standard somewhat similar to the second prong of 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				&#x92;s three-prong test.  But the CDA did not include any limiting terms resembling 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				&#x92;s additional two prongs.  See 
				<em>
					Reno
				</em>
				, 521 U. S., at 873.  It neither contained any requirement that restricted material appeal to the prurient interest nor excluded from the scope of its coverage works with serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.  
				<em>
					Ibid

The tremendous breadth of the CDA magnified the impact caused by differences in community standards across the country, restricting Web publishers from openly displaying a significant amount of material that would have constituted protected speech in some communities across the country but run afoul of community standards in others.

				COPA, by contrast, does not appear to suffer from the same flaw because it applies to significantly less material than did the CDA and defines the harmful-to-minors material restricted by the statute in a manner parallel to the 
				<em>
					Miller 
				</em>
				definition of obscenity.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 5&#x96;6, 10.  To fall within the scope of COPA, works must not only &#x93;depic[t], describ[e], or represen[t], in a manner patently offensive with respect to minors,&#x94; particular sexual acts or parts of the anatomy,

				The Court of Appeals below concluded that 
				<em>
					Hamling
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Sable
				</em>
				 &#x93;are easily distinguished from the present case&#x94; because in both of those cases &#x93;the defendants had the ability to control the distribution of controversial material with respect to the geographic communities into which they released it&#x94; whereas &#x93;Web publishers have no such comparable control.&#x94;  217 F. 3d, at 175&#x96;176.  In neither 
				<em>
					Hamling
				</em>
				 nor 
				<em>
					Sable

				, however, was the speaker&#x92;s ability to target the release of material into particular geographic areas integral to the legal analysis.  In 
				<em>
					Hamling
				</em>
				, the ability to limit the distribution of material to targeted communities was not mentioned, let alone relied upon,

				.  While those cases involved obscenity rather than material that is harmful to minors, we have no reason to believe that the practical effect of varying community standards under COPA, given the statute&#x92;s definition of &#x93;material that is harmful to minors,&#x94; is significantly greater than the practical effect of varying community standards under federal obscenity statutes.

						 Although the phrase &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; appears only in the &#x93;prurient interest&#x94; prong of the Miller test, see Miller v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">24</a> (1973)
, this Court has indicated that the &#x93;patently offensive&#x94; prong of the test is also a question of fact to be decided by a jury applying contemporary community standards.  See, e.g., Pope v. Illinois, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/497" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 497</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">500</a> (1987)
.  The parties here therefore agree that even though &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; are similarly mentioned only in the &#x93;prurient interest&#x94; prong of COPA&#x92;s harmful-to-minors definition, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#e_6_A" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(e)(6)(A)</a>, jurors will apply &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; as well in evaluating whether material is &#x93;patently offensive with respect to minors,&#x94; &#xA7;231(e)(6)(B).

						 While the CDA allowed juries to find material to be patently offensive so long as it depicted or described &#x93;sexual or excretory activities or organs,&#x94; COPA specifically delineates the sexual activities and anatomical features, the depictions of which may be found to be patently offensive: &#x93;an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, an actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual act, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals or post-pubescent female breast.&#x94;

						 Justice Stevens argues that the &#x93;prurient interest&#x94; prong does not &#x93;substantially narrow the category of images covered&#x94; by COPA  because &#x93;[a]rguably every depiction of nudity&#x97;partial or full&#x97;is in some sense erotic with respect to minors,&#x94; post, at 6&#x96;7 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis in original).  We do not agree.  For example, we have great difficulty understanding how pictures of a war victim&#x92;s wounded nude body could reasonably be described under the vast majority of circumstances as erotic, especially when evaluated from the perspective of minors.  See Webster&#x92;s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 422 (1991) (defining erotic as &#x93;of, devoted to, or tending to arouse sexual love or desire&#x94;).

						 Justice Stevens contends that COPA&#x92;s serious value prong only marginally limits the sweep of the statute because it does not protect all material with serious value but just those works with serious value for minors.  See post, at 7.  His dissenting opinion, however, does not refer to any evidence supporting this counterintuitive assertion, and there is certainly none in the record suggesting that COPA restricts about the same amount of material as did the CDA.  Moreover, Justice Stevens does not dispute that COPA&#x92;s &#x93;serious value&#x94; prong serves the important purpose of allowing appellate courts to set &#x93;as a matter of law, a national floor for socially redeeming value.&#x94;  Reno, 521 U.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/418/87" class="subref" title="subref">418 U. S. 87</a> (1974)
, a defendant could be prosecuted in any district through which obscene mail passed while it was on route to its destination, see id., at 143&#x96;144 (Brennan, J., dissenting), and a postal customer obviously lacked the ability to control the path his letter traveled as it made its way to its intended recipient.

						 Justice Stevens&#x92; contention that this Court &#x93;upheld the application of community standards to a nationwide medium&#x94; in Sable due to the fact that &#x93;[it] was at least possible&#x94; for dial-a-porn operators to tailor their messages to particular communities is inaccurate.  See post, at 4 (dissenting opinion).  This Court&#x92;s conclusion clearly did not hinge either on the fact that dial-a-porn operators could prevent callers in particular communities from accessing their messages or on an assessment of how burdensome it would have been for dial-a-porn operators to take that step.  Rather, these companies were required to abide by the standards of various communities for the sole reason that they transmitted their material into those communities.  See Sable, 492 U. S., at 126 (&#x93;If Sable&#x92;s audience is comprised of different communities with different local standards, Sable ultimately bears the burden of complying with the prohibition on obscene messages&#x94;).

						 In addition, COPA does not, as Justice Kennedy suggests, &#x93;foreclose an entire medium of expression.&#x94;  Post, at 6 (quoting City of Ladue v. Gilleo,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">55</a> (1994)
).  While Justice Kennedy and Justice Stevens repeatedly imply that COPA banishes from the Web material deemed harmful to minors by reference to community standards, see, e.g., post, at 6 (opinion concurring in judgment); post, at 7, 11 (dissenting opinion), the statute does no such thing.  It only requires that such material be placed behind adult identification screens.

						 Justice Stevens&#x92; conclusion to the contrary is based on little more than &#x93;speculation.&#x94;  See, e.g., post, at 8 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  The only objective evidence cited in the dissenting opinion for the proposition that COPA &#x93;will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities&#x94; are various anecdotes compiled in an amici brief.  See post, at 10 (citing Brief for Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts et al. as Amici Curiae 4&#x96;10).  Justice Stevens, however, is not even willing to represent that these anecdotes relate to material restricted under COPA, see post, at 10, and we understand his reluctance for the vast majority of the works cited in that brief, if not all of them, are likely unaffected by the statute.  See Brief for Volunteer Lawyer for the Arts et al. as Amici Curiae 4&#x96;10 (describing, among other incidents, controversies in various communities regarding Maya Angelou&#x92;s I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, Judy Blume&#x92;s Are You There God? It&#x92;s Me, Margaret, Aldous Huxley&#x92;s Brave New World, J.D. Salinger&#x92;s Catcher in the Rye, 1993 Academy Award Best Picture nominee The Piano, the American Broadcasting Corporation television network&#x92;s NYPD Blue, and songs of the &#x93;popular folk-rock duo&#x94; the Indigo Girls).  These anecdotes are therefore of questionable relevance to the matter at hand and certainly do not constitute a sufficient basis for invalidating a federal statute.


Moreover, we do not agree with Justice Kennedy&#x92;s suggestion that it is necessary for the Court of Appeals to revisit this question upon remand.  See post, at 8&#x96;9.  The lack of evidence in the record relevant to the question presented does not indicate that &#x93;we should vacate for further consideration.&#x94;  Post, at 9.  Rather, it indicates that respondents, by offering little more than &#x93;speculation,&#x94; have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating in this facial challenge that COPA&#x92;s reliance on community standards renders the statute substantially overbroad.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress first attempted to protect children from exposure to pornographic material on the Internet by enacting the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
133.  The CDA prohibited the knowing transmission over the Internet of obscene or indecent messages to any recipient under 18 years of age.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/223.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;223(a)</a>.  It also forbade any individual from knowingly sending over or displaying on the Internet certain &#x93;patently offensive&#x94; material in a manner available to persons under 18 years of age.  See &#xA7;223(d).  The prohibition specifically extended to &#x93;any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication that, in context, depict[ed] or describ[ed], in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs.&#x94;  &#xA7;223(d)(1).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The CDA provided two affirmative defenses to those prosecuted under the statute.  The first protected individuals who took &#x93;good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions&#x94; to restrict minors from accessing obscene, indecent, and patently offensive material over the Internet.  See &#xA7;223(e)(5)(A).  The second shielded those who restricted minors from accessing such material &#x93;by requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification number.&#x94;  &#xA7;223(e)(5)(B).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Notwithstanding these affirmative defenses, in 
				<em>
					Reno
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					American Civil Liberties Union
				</em>
				, we held that the CDA&#x92;s regulation of indecent transmissions, see &#xA7;223(a), and the display of patently offensive material, see &#xA7;223(d), ran afoul of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  We concluded that &#x93;the CDA lack[ed] the precision that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> requires when a statute regulates the content of speech&#x94; because, &#x93;[i]n order to deny minors access to potentially harmful speech, the CDA effectively suppress[ed] a large amount of speech that adults ha[d] a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 874.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our holding was based on three crucial considerations.  First, &#x93;existing technology did not include any effective method for a sender to prevent minors from obtaining access to its communications on the Internet without also denying access to adults.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 876.  Second, &#x93;[t]he breadth of the CDA&#x92;s coverage [was] wholly unprecedented.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 877.  &#x93;Its open-ended prohibitions embrace[d],&#x94; not only commercial speech or commercial entities, but also &#x93;all nonprofit entities and individuals posting indecent messages or displaying them on their own computers in the presence of minors.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  In addition, because the CDA did not define the terms &#x93;indecent&#x94; and &#x93;patently offensive,&#x94; the statute &#x93;cover[ed] large amounts of nonpornographic material with serious educational or other value.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  As a result, regulated subject matter under the CDA extended to &#x93;discussions about prison rape or safe sexual practices, artistic images that include nude subjects, and arguably the card catalog of the Carnegie Library.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 878.  Third, we found that neither affirmative defense set forth in the CDA &#x93;constitute[d] the sort of &#x91;narrow tailoring&#x92; that [would] save an otherwise patently invalid unconstitutional provision.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 882.  Consequently, only the CDA&#x92;s ban on the knowing transmission of obscene messages survived scrutiny because obscene speech enjoys no 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> protection.  See

				After our decision in 
				<em>
					Reno
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					American Civil Liberties Union
				</em>
				, Congress explored other avenues for restricting minors&#x92; access to pornographic material on the Internet.  In particular, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Child Online Protection Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.

COPA prohibits any person from &#x93;knowingly and with knowledge of the character of the material, in interstate or foreign commerce by means of the World Wide Web, mak[ing] any communication for commercial purposes that is available to any minor and that includes any material that is harmful to minors.&#x94;

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Apparently responding to our objections to the breadth of the CDA&#x92;s coverage, Congress limited the scope of COPA&#x92;s coverage in at least three ways.  First, while the CDA applied to communications over the Internet as a whole, including, for example, e-mail messages, COPA applies only to material displayed on the World Wide Web.  Second, unlike the CDA, COPA covers only communications made &#x93;for commercial purposes.&#x94;

				Like the CDA, COPA also provides affirmative defenses to those subject to prosecution under the statute.  An individual may qualify for a defense if he, &#x93;in good faith, has restricted access by minors to material that is harmful to minors&#x97;(A) by requiring the use of a credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification number; (B) by accepting a digital certificate that verifies age; or (C) by any other reasonable measures that are feasible under available technology.&#x94;  &#xA7;231(c)(1).  Persons violating COPA are subject to both civil and criminal sanctions.  A civil penalty of up to $50,000 may be imposed for each violation of the statute.  Criminal penalties consist of up to six months in prison and/or a maximum fine of $50,000.  An additional fine of $50,000 may be imposed for any intentional violation of the statute.  &#xA7;231(a).

Focusing on respondents&#x92; claim that COPA abridged the free speech rights of adults, the District Court concluded that respondents had established a likelihood of success on the merits.

				 v. 
				<em>

				 217 F. 3d 162 (CA3 2000).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.  Rather than reviewing the District Court&#x92;s &#x93;holding that COPA was not likely to succeed in surviving strict scrutiny analysis,&#x94; the Court of Appeals based its decision entirely on a ground that was not relied upon below and that was &#x93;virtually ignored by the parties and the amicus in their respective briefs.&#x94;

The Court of Appeals concluded that COPA&#x92;s use of &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; to identify material that is harmful to minors rendered the statute substantially overbroad.  Because &#x93;Web publishers are without any means to limit access to their sites based on the geographic location of particular Internet users,&#x94; the Court of Appeals reasoned that COPA would require &#x93;any material that might be deemed harmful by the most puritan of communities in any state&#x94; to be placed behind an age or credit card verification system.

				The Court of Appeals, however, concluded that this Court&#x92;s prior community standards jurisprudence &#x93;has no applicability to the Internet and the Web&#x94; because &#x93;Web publishers are currently without the ability to control the geographic scope of the recipients of their communications.&#x94;  217 F. 3d, at 180.

				Because juries would apply different standards across the country, and Web publishers currently lack the ability to limit access to their sites on a geographic basis, the Court of Appeals feared that COPA&#x92;s &#x93;community standards&#x94; component would effectively force all speakers on the Web to abide by the &#x93;most puritan&#x94; community&#x92;s standards.  217 F. 3d, at 175.

				In evaluating the constitutionality of the CDA, this Court expressed a similar concern over that statute&#x92;s use of community standards to identify patently offensive material on the Internet.  We noted that &#x93;the &#x91;community standards&#x92; criterion as applied to the Internet means that any communication available to a nationwide audience will be judged by the standards of the community most likely to be offended by the message.&#x94;

				The CDA&#x92;s use of community standards to identify patently offensive material, however, was particularly problematic in light of that statute&#x92;s unprecedented breadth and vagueness.  The statute covered communications depicting or describing &#x93;sexual or excretory activities or organs&#x94; that were &#x93;patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards&#x94;&#x97;a standard somewhat similar to the second prong of

				&#x92;s additional two prongs.  See

						 While petitioner contends that a speaker on the Web possesses the ability to communicate only with individuals located in targeted geographic communities, Brief for Petitioner 29, n. 3, he stipulated below that &#x93;[o]nce a provider posts its content on the Internet and chooses to make it available to all, it generally cannot prevent that content from entering any geographic community.&#x94;  App. 187.  The District Court adopted this stipulation as a finding of fact, see American Civil Liberties Union v. Reno, 31 F.

						 Although the phrase &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; appears only in the &#x93;prurient interest&#x94; prong of the Miller test, see Miller v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">24</a> (1973)
, this Court has indicated that the &#x93;patently offensive&#x94; prong of the test is also a question of fact to be decided by a jury applying contemporary community standards.  See, e.g., Pope v. Illinois, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/497" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 497</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">500</a> (1987)
.  The parties here therefore agree that even though &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; are similarly mentioned only in the &#x93;prurient interest&#x94; prong of COPA&#x92;s harmful-to-minors definition, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#e_6_A" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(e)(6)(A)</a>, jurors will apply &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; as well in evaluating whether material is &#x93;patently offensive with respect to minors,&#x94; &#xA7;231(e)(6)(B).

						 While the CDA allowed juries to find material to be patently offensive so long as it depicted or described &#x93;sexual or excretory activities or organs,&#x94; COPA specifically delineates the sexual activities and anatomical features, the depictions of which may be found to be patently offensive: &#x93;an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, an actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual act, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals or post-pubescent female breast.&#x94;

						 Justice Stevens argues that the &#x93;prurient interest&#x94; prong does not &#x93;substantially narrow the category of images covered&#x94; by COPA  because &#x93;[a]rguably every depiction of nudity&#x97;partial or full&#x97;is in some sense erotic with respect to minors,&#x94; post, at 6&#x96;7 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis in original).  We do not agree.  For example, we have great difficulty understanding how pictures of a war victim&#x92;s wounded nude body could reasonably be described under the vast majority of circumstances as erotic, especially when evaluated from the perspective of minors.  See Webster&#x92;s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 422 (1991) (defining erotic as &#x93;of, devoted to, or tending to arouse sexual love or desire&#x94;).

						 Justice Stevens contends that COPA&#x92;s serious value prong only marginally limits the sweep of the statute because it does not protect all material with serious value but just those works with serious value for minors.  See post, at 7.  His dissenting opinion, however, does not refer to any evidence supporting this counterintuitive assertion, and there is certainly none in the record suggesting that COPA restricts about the same amount of material as did the CDA.  Moreover, Justice Stevens does not dispute that COPA&#x92;s &#x93;serious value&#x94; prong serves the important purpose of allowing appellate courts to set &#x93;as a matter of law, a national floor for socially redeeming value.&#x94;  Reno, 521 U.

						 Although nowhere mentioned in the relevant statutory text, this Court has held that the Miller test defines regulated speech for purposes of federal obscenity statutes such as 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/223.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;223(b)</a> (1994 ed.).  See, e.g., Smith v. United States,

						 This fact was perhaps omitted because under the federal statute at issue in Hamling v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/418/87" class="subref" title="subref">418 U. S. 87</a> (1974)
, a defendant could be prosecuted in any district through which obscene mail passed while it was on route to its destination, see id., at 143&#x96;144 (Brennan, J., dissenting), and a postal customer obviously lacked the ability to control the path his letter traveled as it made its way to its intended recipient.

						 Justice Stevens&#x92; contention that this Court &#x93;upheld the application of community standards to a nationwide medium&#x94; in Sable due to the fact that &#x93;[it] was at least possible&#x94; for dial-a-porn operators to tailor their messages to particular communities is inaccurate.  See post, at 4 (dissenting opinion).  This Court&#x92;s conclusion clearly did not hinge either on the fact that dial-a-porn operators could prevent callers in particular communities from accessing their messages or on an assessment of how burdensome it would have been for dial-a-porn operators to take that step.  Rather, these companies were required to abide by the standards of various communities for the sole reason that they transmitted their material into those communities.  See Sable, 492 U. S., at 126 (&#x93;If Sable&#x92;s audience is comprised of different communities with different local standards, Sable ultimately bears the burden of complying with the prohibition on obscene messages&#x94;).

						 In addition, COPA does not, as Justice Kennedy suggests, &#x93;foreclose an entire medium of expression.&#x94;  Post, at 6 (quoting City of Ladue v. Gilleo, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/512/43" class="subref" title="subref">512 U. S. 43</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">55</a> (1994)
).  While Justice Kennedy and Justice Stevens repeatedly imply that COPA banishes from the Web material deemed harmful to minors by reference to community standards, see, e.g., post, at 6 (opinion concurring in judgment); post, at 7, 11 (dissenting opinion), the statute does no such thing.  It only requires that such material be placed behind adult identification screens.

						 Justice Stevens&#x92; conclusion to the contrary is based on little more than &#x93;speculation.&#x94;  See, e.g., post, at 8 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  The only objective evidence cited in the dissenting opinion for the proposition that COPA &#x93;will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities&#x94; are various anecdotes compiled in an amici brief.  See post, at 10 (citing Brief for Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts et al. as Amici Curiae 4&#x96;10).  Justice Stevens, however, is not even willing to represent that these anecdotes relate to material restricted under COPA, see post, at 10, and we understand his reluctance for the vast majority of the works cited in that brief, if not all of them, are likely unaffected by the statute.  See Brief for Volunteer Lawyer for the Arts et al. as Amici Curiae 4&#x96;10 (describing, among other incidents, controversies in various communities regarding Maya Angelou&#x92;s I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, Judy Blume&#x92;s Are You There God? It&#x92;s Me, Margaret, Aldous Huxley&#x92;s Brave New World, J.D. Salinger&#x92;s Catcher in the Rye, 1993 Academy Award Best Picture nominee The Piano, the American Broadcasting Corporation television network&#x92;s NYPD Blue, and songs of the &#x93;popular folk-rock duo&#x94; the Indigo Girls).  These anecdotes are therefore of questionable relevance to the matter at hand and certainly do not constitute a sufficient basis for invalidating a federal statute.


Moreover, we do not agree with Justice Kennedy&#x92;s suggestion that it is necessary for the Court of Appeals to revisit this question upon remand.  See post, at 8&#x96;9.  The lack of evidence in the record relevant to the question presented does not indicate that &#x93;we should vacate for further consideration.&#x94;  Post, at 9.  Rather, it indicates that respondents, by offering little more than &#x93;speculation,&#x94; have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating in this facial challenge that COPA&#x92;s reliance on community standards renders the statute substantially overbroad.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress first attempted to protect children from exposure to pornographic material on the Internet by enacting the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
133.  The CDA prohibited the knowing transmission over the Internet of obscene or indecent messages to any recipient under 18 years of age.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/223.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;223(a)</a>.  It also forbade any individual from knowingly sending over or displaying on the Internet certain &#x93;patently offensive&#x94; material in a manner available to persons under 18 years of age.  See &#xA7;223(d).  The prohibition specifically extended to &#x93;any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication that, in context, depict[ed] or describ[ed], in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs.&#x94;  &#xA7;223(d)(1).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The CDA provided two affirmative defenses to those prosecuted under the statute.  The first protected individuals who took &#x93;good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions&#x94; to restrict minors from accessing obscene, indecent, and patently offensive material over the Internet.  See &#xA7;223(e)(5)(A).  The second shielded those who restricted minors from accessing such material &#x93;by requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification number.&#x94;  &#xA7;223(e)(5)(B).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Notwithstanding these affirmative defenses, in 
				<em>
					Reno
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					American Civil Liberties Union
				</em>
				, we held that the CDA&#x92;s regulation of indecent transmissions, see &#xA7;223(a), and the display of patently offensive material, see &#xA7;223(d), ran afoul of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  We concluded that &#x93;the CDA lack[ed] the precision that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> requires when a statute regulates the content of speech&#x94; because, &#x93;[i]n order to deny minors access to potentially harmful speech, the CDA effectively suppress[ed] a large amount of speech that adults ha[d] a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 874.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our holding was based on three crucial considerations.  First, &#x93;existing technology did not include any effective method for a sender to prevent minors from obtaining access to its communications on the Internet without also denying access to adults.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 876.  Second, &#x93;[t]he breadth of the CDA&#x92;s coverage [was] wholly unprecedented.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 877.  &#x93;Its open-ended prohibitions embrace[d],&#x94; not only commercial speech or commercial entities, but also &#x93;all nonprofit entities and individuals posting indecent messages or displaying them on their own computers in the presence of minors.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  In addition, because the CDA did not define the terms &#x93;indecent&#x94; and &#x93;patently offensive,&#x94; the statute &#x93;cover[ed] large amounts of nonpornographic material with serious educational or other value.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  As a result, regulated subject matter under the CDA extended to &#x93;discussions about prison rape or safe sexual practices, artistic images that include nude subjects, and arguably the card catalog of the Carnegie Library.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 878.  Third, we found that neither affirmative defense set forth in the CDA &#x93;constitute[d] the sort of &#x91;narrow tailoring&#x92; that [would] save an otherwise patently invalid unconstitutional provision.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id

				Apparently responding to our objections to the breadth of the CDA&#x92;s coverage, Congress limited the scope of COPA&#x92;s coverage in at least three ways.  First, while the CDA applied to communications over the Internet as a whole, including, for example, e-mail messages, COPA applies only to material displayed on the World Wide Web.  Second, unlike the CDA, COPA covers only communications made &#x93;for commercial purposes.&#x94;

				Like the CDA, COPA also provides affirmative defenses to those subject to prosecution under the statute.  An individual may qualify for a defense if he, &#x93;in good faith, has restricted access by minors to material that is harmful to minors&#x97;(A) by requiring the use of a credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification number; (B) by accepting a digital certificate that verifies age; or (C) by any other reasonable measures that are feasible under available technology.&#x94;  &#xA7;231(c)(1).

				 217 F. 3d 162 (CA3 2000).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.  Rather than reviewing the District Court&#x92;s &#x93;holding that COPA was not likely to succeed in surviving strict scrutiny analysis,&#x94; the Court of Appeals based its decision entirely on a ground that was not relied upon below and that was &#x93;virtually ignored by the parties and the amicus in their respective briefs.&#x94;

The Court of Appeals concluded that COPA&#x92;s use of &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; to identify material that is harmful to minors rendered the statute substantially overbroad.  Because &#x93;Web publishers are without any means to limit access to their sites based on the geographic location of particular Internet users,&#x94; the Court of Appeals reasoned that COPA would require &#x93;any material that might be deemed harmful by the most puritan of communities in any state&#x94; to be placed behind an age or credit card verification system.

				Because juries would apply different standards across the country, and Web publishers currently lack the ability to limit access to their sites on a geographic basis, the Court of Appeals feared that COPA&#x92;s &#x93;community standards&#x94; component would effectively force all speakers on the Web to abide by the &#x93;most puritan&#x94; community&#x92;s standards.  217 F. 3d, at 175.

				In evaluating the constitutionality of the CDA, this Court expressed a similar concern over that statute&#x92;s use of community standards to identify patently offensive material on the Internet.  We noted that &#x93;the &#x91;community standards&#x92; criterion as applied to the Internet means that any communication available to a nationwide audience will be judged by the standards of the community most likely to be offended by the message.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Reno

				, 521 U. S., at 877&#x96;878.  The Court of Appeals below relied heavily on this observation, stating that it was &#x93;not persuaded that the Supreme Court&#x92;s concern with respect to the &#x91;community standards&#x92; criterion has been sufficiently remedied by Congress in COPA.&#x94;  217 F. 3d, at 174.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The CDA&#x92;s use of community standards to identify patently offensive material, however, was particularly problematic in light of that statute&#x92;s unprecedented breadth and vagueness.  The statute covered communications depicting or describing &#x93;sexual or excretory activities or organs&#x94; that were &#x93;patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards&#x94;&#x97;a standard somewhat similar to the second prong of 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				&#x92;s three-prong test.  But the CDA did not include any limiting terms resembling 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				&#x92;s additional two prongs.  See 
				<em>
					Reno
				</em>
				, 521 U. S., at 873.  It neither contained any requirement that restricted material appeal to the prurient interest nor excluded from the scope of its coverage works with serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.  
				<em>
					Ibid

				.  The tremendous breadth of the CDA magnified the impact caused by differences in community standards across the country, restricting Web publishers from openly displaying a significant amount of material that would have constituted protected speech in some communities across the country but run afoul of community standards in others.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				COPA, by contrast, does not appear to suffer from the same flaw because it applies to significantly less material than did the CDA and defines the harmful-to-minors material restricted by the statute in a manner parallel to the 
				<em>
					Miller 
				</em>
				definition of obscenity.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 5&#x96;6, 10.  To fall within the scope of COPA, works must not only &#x93;depic[t], describ[e], or represen[t], in a manner patently offensive with respect to minors,&#x94; particular sexual acts or parts of the anatomy,

				The Court of Appeals below concluded that

				</em>
				 &#x93;are easily distinguished from the present case&#x94; because in both of those cases &#x93;the defendants had the ability to control the distribution of controversial material with respect to the geographic communities into which they released it&#x94; whereas &#x93;Web publishers have no such comparable control.&#x94;  217 F. 3d, at 175&#x96;176.  In neither

While those cases involved obscenity rather than material that is harmful to minors, we have no reason to believe that the practical effect of varying community standards under COPA, given the statute&#x92;s definition of &#x93;material that is harmful to minors,&#x94; is significantly greater than the practical effect of varying community standards under federal obscenity statutes.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">24</a> (1973)

						 Justice Stevens argues that the &#x93;prurient interest&#x94; prong does not &#x93;substantially narrow the category of images covered&#x94; by COPA  because &#x93;[a]rguably every depiction of nudity&#x97;partial or full&#x97;is in some sense erotic with respect to minors,&#x94; post, at 6&#x96;7 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis in original).  We do not agree.  For example, we have great difficulty understanding how pictures of a war victim&#x92;s wounded nude body could reasonably be described under the vast majority of circumstances as erotic, especially when evaluated from the perspective of minors.  See Webster&#x92;s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 422 (1991) (defining erotic as &#x93;of, devoted to, or tending to arouse sexual love or desire&#x94;).

						 Justice Stevens contends that COPA&#x92;s serious value prong only marginally limits the sweep of the statute because it does not protect all material with serious value but just those works with serious value for minors.  See post, at 7.  His dissenting opinion, however, does not refer to any evidence supporting this counterintuitive assertion, and there is certainly none in the record suggesting that COPA restricts about the same amount of material as did the CDA.  Moreover, Justice Stevens does not dispute that COPA&#x92;s &#x93;serious value&#x94; prong serves the important purpose of allowing appellate courts to set &#x93;as a matter of law, a national floor for socially redeeming value.&#x94;  Reno, 521 U.

						 Justice Stevens&#x92; contention that this Court &#x93;upheld the application of community standards to a nationwide medium&#x94; in Sable due to the fact that &#x93;[it] was at least possible&#x94; for dial-a-porn operators to tailor their messages to particular communities is inaccurate.  See post, at 4 (dissenting opinion).  This Court&#x92;s conclusion clearly did not hinge either on the fact that dial-a-porn operators could prevent callers in particular communities from accessing their messages or on an assessment of how burdensome it would have been for dial-a-porn operators to take that step.  Rather, these companies were required to abide by the standards of various communities for the sole reason that they transmitted their material into those communities.  See Sable, 492 U. S., at 126 (&#x93;If Sable&#x92;s audience is comprised of different communities with different local standards, Sable ultimately bears the burden of complying with the prohibition on obscene messages&#x94;).

While Justice Kennedy and Justice Stevens repeatedly imply that COPA banishes from the Web material deemed harmful to minors by reference to community standards, see, e.g., post, at 6 (opinion concurring in judgment); post, at 7, 11 (dissenting opinion), the statute does no such thing.  It only requires that such material be placed behind adult identification screens.

						 Justice Stevens&#x92; conclusion to the contrary is based on little more than &#x93;speculation.&#x94;  See, e.g., post, at 8 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  The only objective evidence cited in the dissenting opinion for the proposition that COPA &#x93;will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities&#x94; are various anecdotes compiled in an amici brief.  See post, at 10 (citing Brief for Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts et al. as Amici Curiae 4&#x96;10).  Justice Stevens, however, is not even willing to represent that these anecdotes relate to material restricted under COPA, see post, at 10, and we understand his reluctance for the vast majority of the works cited in that brief, if not all of them, are likely unaffected by the statute.  See Brief for Volunteer Lawyer for the Arts et al. as Amici Curiae 4&#x96;10 (describing, among other incidents, controversies in various communities regarding Maya Angelou&#x92;s I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, Judy Blume&#x92;s Are You There God? It&#x92;s Me, Margaret, Aldous Huxley&#x92;s Brave New World, J.D. Salinger&#x92;s Catcher in the Rye, 1993 Academy Award Best Picture nominee The Piano, the American Broadcasting Corporation television network&#x92;s NYPD Blue, and songs of the &#x93;popular folk-rock duo&#x94; the Indigo Girls).  These anecdotes are therefore of questionable relevance to the matter at hand and certainly do not constitute a sufficient basis for invalidating a federal statute.


Moreover, we do not agree with Justice Kennedy&#x92;s suggestion that it is necessary for the Court of Appeals to revisit this question upon remand.  See post, at 8&#x96;9.  The lack of evidence in the record relevant to the question presented does not indicate that &#x93;we should vacate for further consideration.&#x94;  Post, at 9.  Rather, it indicates that respondents, by offering little more than &#x93;speculation,&#x94; have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating in this facial challenge that COPA&#x92;s reliance on community standards renders the statute substantially overbroad.

Supp. 2d, at 476 (&#x93;A child with minimal knowledge of a computer, the ability to operate a browser, and the skill to type a few simple words may be able to access sexual images and content over the World Wide Web&#x94;).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Congress first attempted to protect children from exposure to pornographic material on the Internet by enacting the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
133.  The CDA prohibited the knowing transmission over the Internet of obscene or indecent messages to any recipient under 18 years of age.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/223.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;223(a)</a>.  It also forbade any individual from knowingly sending over or displaying on the Internet certain &#x93;patently offensive&#x94; material in a manner available to persons under 18 years of age.  See &#xA7;223(d).  The prohibition specifically extended to &#x93;any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication that, in context, depict[ed] or describ[ed], in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs.&#x94;  &#xA7;223(d)(1).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The CDA provided two affirmative defenses to those prosecuted under the statute.  The first protected individuals who took &#x93;good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions&#x94; to restrict minors from accessing obscene, indecent, and patently offensive material over the Internet.  See &#xA7;223(e)(5)(A).  The second shielded those who restricted minors from accessing such material &#x93;by requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification number.&#x94;  &#xA7;223(e)(5)(B).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Notwithstanding these affirmative defenses, in 
				<em>
					Reno
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					American Civil Liberties Union
				</em>
				, we held that the CDA&#x92;s regulation of indecent transmissions, see &#xA7;223(a), and the display of patently offensive material, see &#xA7;223(d), ran afoul of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  We concluded that &#x93;the CDA lack[ed] the precision that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> requires when a statute regulates the content of speech&#x94; because, &#x93;[i]n order to deny minors access to potentially harmful speech, the CDA effectively suppress[ed] a large amount of speech that adults ha[d] a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 874.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our holding was based on three crucial considerations.  First, &#x93;existing technology did not include any effective method for a sender to prevent minors from obtaining access to its communications on the Internet without also denying access to adults.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 876.  Second, &#x93;[t]he breadth of the CDA&#x92;s coverage [was] wholly unprecedented.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 877.  &#x93;Its open-ended prohibitions embrace[d],&#x94; not only commercial speech or commercial entities, but also &#x93;all nonprofit entities and individuals posting indecent messages or displaying them on their own computers in the presence of minors.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  In addition, because the CDA did not define the terms &#x93;indecent&#x94; and &#x93;patently offensive,&#x94; the statute &#x93;cover[ed] large amounts of nonpornographic material with serious educational or other value.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  As a result, regulated subject matter under the CDA extended to &#x93;discussions about prison rape or safe sexual practices, artistic images that include nude subjects, and arguably the card catalog of the Carnegie Library.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 878.  Third, we found that neither affirmative defense set forth in the CDA &#x93;constitute[d] the sort of &#x91;narrow tailoring&#x92; that [would] save an otherwise patently invalid unconstitutional provision.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 882.  Consequently, only the CDA&#x92;s ban on the knowing transmission of obscene messages survived scrutiny because obscene speech enjoys no 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> protection.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 883.

				After our decision in 
				<em>
					Reno
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					American Civil Liberties Union
				</em>
				, Congress explored other avenues for restricting minors&#x92; access to pornographic material on the Internet.  In particular, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Child Online Protection Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.
2681&#x96;
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				736 (codified in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231</a> (1994 ed., Supp. V)). COPA prohibits any person from &#x93;knowingly and with knowledge of the character of the material, in interstate or foreign commerce by means of the World Wide Web, mak[ing] any communication for commercial purposes that is available to any minor and that includes any material that is harmful to minors.&#x94;

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Apparently responding to our objections to the breadth of the CDA&#x92;s coverage, Congress limited the scope of COPA&#x92;s coverage in at least three ways.  First, while the CDA applied to communications over the Internet as a whole, including, for example, e-mail messages, COPA applies only to material displayed on the World Wide Web.  Second, unlike the CDA, COPA covers only communications made &#x93;for commercial purposes.&#x94;

				Like the CDA, COPA also provides affirmative defenses to those subject to prosecution under the statute.  An individual may qualify for a defense if he, &#x93;in good faith, has restricted access by minors to material that is harmful to minors&#x97;(A) by requiring the use of a credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification number; (B) by accepting a digital certificate that verifies age; or (C) by any other reasonable measures that are feasible under available technology.&#x94;  &#xA7;231(c)(1).  Persons violating COPA are subject to both civil and criminal sanctions.  A civil penalty of up to $50,000 may be imposed for each violation of the statute.  Criminal penalties consist of up to six months in prison and/or a maximum fine of $50,000.  An additional fine of $50,000 may be imposed for any intentional violation of the statute.  &#xA7;231(a).

Rather than reviewing the District Court&#x92;s &#x93;holding that COPA was not likely to succeed in surviving strict scrutiny analysis,&#x94; the Court of Appeals based its decision entirely on a ground that was not relied upon below and that was &#x93;virtually ignored by the parties and the amicus in their respective briefs.&#x94;

Because &#x93;Web publishers are without any means to limit access to their sites based on the geographic location of particular Internet users,&#x94; the Court of Appeals reasoned that COPA would require &#x93;any material that might be deemed harmful by the most puritan of communities in any state&#x94; to be placed behind an age or credit card verification system.

				The Court of Appeals, however, concluded that this Court&#x92;s prior community standards jurisprudence &#x93;has no applicability to the Internet and the Web&#x94; because &#x93;Web publishers are currently without the ability to control the geographic scope of the recipients of their communications.&#x94;  217 F. 3d, at 180.

Petitioner concedes the latter point, see Reply Brief for Petitioner 3&#x96;4, and admits that, even if jurors were instructed under COPA to apply the standards of the adult population as a whole, the variance in community standards across the country could still cause juries in different locations to reach inconsistent conclusions as to whether a particular work is &#x93;harmful to minors.&#x94;  Brief for Petitioner 39.

				Because juries would apply different standards across the country, and Web publishers currently lack the ability to limit access to their sites on a geographic basis, the Court of Appeals feared that COPA&#x92;s &#x93;community standards&#x94; component would effectively force all speakers on the Web to abide by the &#x93;most puritan&#x94; community&#x92;s standards.  217 F. 3d, at 175.

				In evaluating the constitutionality of the CDA, this Court expressed a similar concern over that statute&#x92;s use of community standards to identify patently offensive material on the Internet.  We noted that &#x93;the &#x91;community standards&#x92; criterion as applied to the Internet means that any communication available to a nationwide audience will be judged by the standards of the community most likely to be offended by the message.&#x94;

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The CDA&#x92;s use of community standards to identify patently offensive material, however, was particularly problematic in light of that statute&#x92;s unprecedented breadth and vagueness.  The statute covered communications depicting or describing &#x93;sexual or excretory activities or organs&#x94; that were &#x93;patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards&#x94;&#x97;a standard somewhat similar to the second prong of 
				<em>
					Miller

				&#x92;s three-prong test.  But the CDA did not include any limiting terms resembling 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				&#x92;s additional two prongs.  See 
				<em>
					Reno

				<em>

The tremendous breadth of the CDA magnified the impact caused by differences in community standards across the country, restricting Web publishers from openly displaying a significant amount of material that would have constituted protected speech in some communities across the country but run afoul of community standards in others.

				COPA, by contrast, does not appear to suffer from the same flaw because it applies to significantly less material than did the CDA and defines the harmful-to-minors material restricted by the statute in a manner parallel to the

				definition of obscenity.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 5&#x96;6, 10.  To fall within the scope of COPA, works must not only &#x93;depic[t], describ[e], or represen[t], in a manner patently offensive with respect to minors,&#x94; particular sexual acts or parts of the anatomy,

While those cases involved obscenity rather than material that is harmful to minors, we have no reason to believe that the practical effect of varying community standards under COPA, given the statute&#x92;s definition of &#x93;material that is harmful to minors,&#x94; is significantly greater than the practical effect of varying community standards under federal obscenity statutes.

						 Although the phrase &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; appears only in the &#x93;prurient interest&#x94; prong of the Miller test, see Miller v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">24</a> (1973)
, this Court has indicated that the &#x93;patently offensive&#x94; prong of the test is also a question of fact to be decided by a jury applying contemporary community standards.  See, e.g., Pope v. Illinois, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/497" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 497</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">500</a> (1987)
.  The parties here therefore agree that even though &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; are similarly mentioned only in the &#x93;prurient interest&#x94; prong of COPA&#x92;s harmful-to-minors definition, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#e_6_A" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(e)(6)(A)</a>, jurors will apply &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; as well in evaluating whether material is &#x93;patently offensive with respect to minors,&#x94; &#xA7;231(e)(6)(B).

						 While the CDA allowed juries to find material to be patently offensive so long as it depicted or described &#x93;sexual or excretory activities or organs,&#x94; COPA specifically delineates the sexual activities and anatomical features, the depictions of which may be found to be patently offensive: &#x93;an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, an actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual act, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals or post-pubescent female breast.&#x94;

						 Justice Stevens argues that the &#x93;prurient interest&#x94; prong does not &#x93;substantially narrow the category of images covered&#x94; by COPA  because &#x93;[a]rguably every depiction of nudity&#x97;partial or full&#x97;is in some sense erotic with respect to minors,&#x94; post, at 6&#x96;7 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis in original).  We do not agree.  For example, we have great difficulty understanding how pictures of a war victim&#x92;s wounded nude body could reasonably be described under the vast majority of circumstances as erotic, especially when evaluated from the perspective of minors.  See Webster&#x92;s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 422 (1991) (defining erotic as &#x93;of, devoted to, or tending to arouse sexual love or desire&#x94;).

						 Justice Stevens contends that COPA&#x92;s serious value prong only marginally limits the sweep of the statute because it does not protect all material with serious value but just those works with serious value for minors.  See post, at 7.  His dissenting opinion, however, does not refer to any evidence supporting this counterintuitive assertion, and there is certainly none in the record suggesting that COPA restricts about the same amount of material as did the CDA.  Moreover, Justice Stevens does not dispute that COPA&#x92;s &#x93;serious value&#x94; prong serves the important purpose of allowing appellate courts to set &#x93;as a matter of law, a national floor for socially redeeming value.&#x94;  Reno, 521 U.

, a defendant could be prosecuted in any district through which obscene mail passed while it was on route to its destination, see id., at 143&#x96;144 (Brennan, J., dissenting), and a postal customer obviously lacked the ability to control the path his letter traveled as it made its way to its intended recipient.

						 Justice Stevens&#x92; contention that this Court &#x93;upheld the application of community standards to a nationwide medium&#x94; in Sable due to the fact that &#x93;[it] was at least possible&#x94; for dial-a-porn operators to tailor their messages to particular communities is inaccurate.  See post, at 4 (dissenting opinion).  This Court&#x92;s conclusion clearly did not hinge either on the fact that dial-a-porn operators could prevent callers in particular communities from accessing their messages or on an assessment of how burdensome it would have been for dial-a-porn operators to take that step.  Rather, these companies were required to abide by the standards of various communities for the sole reason that they transmitted their material into those communities.  See Sable, 492 U. S., at 126 (&#x93;If Sable&#x92;s audience is comprised of different communities with different local standards, Sable ultimately bears the burden of complying with the prohibition on obscene messages&#x94;).

						 In addition, COPA does not, as Justice Kennedy suggests, &#x93;foreclose an entire medium of expression.&#x94;  Post, at 6 (quoting City of Ladue v. Gilleo,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">55</a> (1994)
).  While Justice Kennedy and Justice Stevens repeatedly imply that COPA banishes from the Web material deemed harmful to minors by reference to community standards, see, e.g., post, at 6 (opinion concurring in judgment); post, at 7, 11 (dissenting opinion), the statute does no such thing.  It only requires that such material be placed behind adult identification screens.

						 Justice Stevens&#x92; conclusion to the contrary is based on little more than &#x93;speculation.&#x94;  See, e.g., post, at 8 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  The only objective evidence cited in the dissenting opinion for the proposition that COPA &#x93;will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities&#x94; are various anecdotes compiled in an amici brief.  See post, at 10 (citing Brief for Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts et al. as Amici Curiae 4&#x96;10).  Justice Stevens, however, is not even willing to represent that these anecdotes relate to material restricted under COPA, see post, at 10, and we understand his reluctance for the vast majority of the works cited in that brief, if not all of them, are likely unaffected by the statute.  See Brief for Volunteer Lawyer for the Arts et al. as Amici Curiae 4&#x96;10 (describing, among other incidents, controversies in various communities regarding Maya Angelou&#x92;s I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, Judy Blume&#x92;s Are You There God? It&#x92;s Me, Margaret, Aldous Huxley&#x92;s Brave New World, J.D. Salinger&#x92;s Catcher in the Rye, 1993 Academy Award Best Picture nominee The Piano, the American Broadcasting Corporation television network&#x92;s NYPD Blue, and songs of the &#x93;popular folk-rock duo&#x94; the Indigo Girls).  These anecdotes are therefore of questionable relevance to the matter at hand and certainly do not constitute a sufficient basis for invalidating a federal statute.


Moreover, we do not agree with Justice Kennedy&#x92;s suggestion that it is necessary for the Court of Appeals to revisit this question upon remand.  See post, at 8&#x96;9.  The lack of evidence in the record relevant to the question presented does not indicate that &#x93;we should vacate for further consideration.&#x94;  Post, at 9.  Rather, it indicates that respondents, by offering little more than &#x93;speculation,&#x94; have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating in this facial challenge that COPA&#x92;s reliance on community standards renders the statute substantially overbroad.

				Congress first attempted to protect children from exposure to pornographic material on the Internet by enacting the Communications Decency Act of 1996 (CDA), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
133.  The CDA prohibited the knowing transmission over the Internet of obscene or indecent messages to any recipient under 18 years of age.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/223.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;223(a)</a>.  It also forbade any individual from knowingly sending over or displaying on the Internet certain &#x93;patently offensive&#x94; material in a manner available to persons under 18 years of age.  See &#xA7;223(d).  The prohibition specifically extended to &#x93;any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication that, in context, depict[ed] or describ[ed], in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs.&#x94;  &#xA7;223(d)(1).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The CDA provided two affirmative defenses to those prosecuted under the statute.  The first protected individuals who took &#x93;good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions&#x94; to restrict minors from accessing obscene, indecent, and patently offensive material over the Internet.  See &#xA7;223(e)(5)(A).  The second shielded those who restricted minors from accessing such material &#x93;by requiring use of a verified credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification number.&#x94;  &#xA7;223(e)(5)(B).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Notwithstanding these affirmative defenses, in 
				<em>
					Reno
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					American Civil Liberties Union
				</em>
				, we held that the CDA&#x92;s regulation of indecent transmissions, see &#xA7;223(a), and the display of patently offensive material, see &#xA7;223(d), ran afoul of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  We concluded that &#x93;the CDA lack[ed] the precision that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> requires when a statute regulates the content of speech&#x94; because, &#x93;[i]n order to deny minors access to potentially harmful speech, the CDA effectively suppress[ed] a large amount of speech that adults ha[d] a constitutional right to receive and to address to one another.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 874.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our holding was based on three crucial considerations.  First, &#x93;existing technology did not include any effective method for a sender to prevent minors from obtaining access to its communications on the Internet without also denying access to adults.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 876.  Second, &#x93;[t]he breadth of the CDA&#x92;s coverage [was] wholly unprecedented.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 877.  &#x93;Its open-ended prohibitions embrace[d],&#x94; not only commercial speech or commercial entities, but also &#x93;all nonprofit entities and individuals posting indecent messages or displaying them on their own computers in the presence of minors.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  In addition, because the CDA did not define the terms &#x93;indecent&#x94; and &#x93;patently offensive,&#x94; the statute &#x93;cover[ed] large amounts of nonpornographic material with serious educational or other value.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid
				</em>
				.  As a result, regulated subject matter under the CDA extended to &#x93;discussions about prison rape or safe sexual practices, artistic images that include nude subjects, and arguably the card catalog of the Carnegie Library.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 878.  Third, we found that neither affirmative defense set forth in the CDA &#x93;constitute[d] the sort of &#x91;narrow tailoring&#x92; that [would] save an otherwise patently invalid unconstitutional provision.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id
				</em>
				., at 882.  Consequently, only the CDA&#x92;s ban on the knowing transmission of obscene messages survived scrutiny because obscene speech enjoys no 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> protection.  See

				After our decision in 
				<em>
					Reno
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					American Civil Liberties Union
				</em>
				, Congress explored other avenues for restricting minors&#x92; access to pornographic material on the Internet.  In particular, Congress passed and the President signed into law the Child Online Protection Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">112</a>Stat.
2681&#x96;

COPA prohibits any person from &#x93;knowingly and with knowledge of the character of the material, in interstate or foreign commerce by means of the World Wide Web, mak[ing] any communication for commercial purposes that is available to any minor and that includes any material that is harmful to minors.&#x94;

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Apparently responding to our objections to the breadth of the CDA&#x92;s coverage, Congress limited the scope of COPA&#x92;s coverage in at least three ways.  First, while the CDA applied to communications over the Internet as a whole, including, for example, e-mail messages, COPA applies only to material displayed on the World Wide Web.  Second, unlike the CDA, COPA covers only communications made &#x93;for commercial purposes.&#x94;

				Like the CDA, COPA also provides affirmative defenses to those subject to prosecution under the statute.  An individual may qualify for a defense if he, &#x93;in good faith, has restricted access by minors to material that is harmful to minors&#x97;(A) by requiring the use of a credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal identification number; (B) by accepting a digital certificate that verifies age; or (C) by any other reasonable measures that are feasible under available technology.&#x94;  &#xA7;231(c)(1).  Persons violating COPA are subject to both civil and criminal sanctions.  A civil penalty of up to $50,000 may be imposed for each violation of the statute.  Criminal penalties consist of up to six months in prison and/or a maximum fine of $50,000.  An additional fine of $50,000 may be imposed for any intentional violation of the statute.  &#xA7;231(a).

				The District Court granted respondents&#x92; motion for a preliminary injunction, barring the Government from enforcing the Act until the merits of respondents&#x92; claims could be adjudicated.  31 F.

Focusing on respondents&#x92; claim that COPA abridged the free speech rights of adults, the District Court concluded that respondents had established a likelihood of success on the merits.

				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				 217 F. 3d 162 (CA3 2000).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.  Rather than reviewing the District Court&#x92;s &#x93;holding that COPA was not likely to succeed in surviving strict scrutiny analysis,&#x94; the Court of Appeals based its decision entirely on a ground that was not relied upon below and that was &#x93;virtually ignored by the parties and the amicus in their respective briefs.&#x94;

The Court of Appeals concluded that COPA&#x92;s use of &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; to identify material that is harmful to minors rendered the statute substantially overbroad.  Because &#x93;Web publishers are without any means to limit access to their sites based on the geographic location of particular Internet users,&#x94; the Court of Appeals reasoned that COPA would require &#x93;any material that might be deemed harmful by the most puritan of communities in any state&#x94; to be placed behind an age or credit card verification system.

				The Court of Appeals, however, concluded that this Court&#x92;s prior community standards jurisprudence &#x93;has no applicability to the Internet and the Web&#x94; because &#x93;Web publishers are currently without the ability to control the geographic scope of the recipients of their communications.&#x94;  217 F. 3d, at 180.

				Because juries would apply different standards across the country, and Web publishers currently lack the ability to limit access to their sites on a geographic basis, the Court of Appeals feared that COPA&#x92;s &#x93;community standards&#x94; component would effectively force all speakers on the Web to abide by the &#x93;most puritan&#x94; community&#x92;s standards.  217 F. 3d, at 175.

				In evaluating the constitutionality of the CDA, this Court expressed a similar concern over that statute&#x92;s use of community standards to identify patently offensive material on the Internet.  We noted that &#x93;the &#x91;community standards&#x92; criterion as applied to the Internet means that any communication available to a nationwide audience will be judged by the standards of the community most likely to be offended by the message.&#x94;

				The CDA&#x92;s use of community standards to identify patently offensive material, however, was particularly problematic in light of that statute&#x92;s unprecedented breadth and vagueness.  The statute covered communications depicting or describing &#x93;sexual or excretory activities or organs&#x94; that were &#x93;patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards&#x94;&#x97;a standard somewhat similar to the second prong of

				&#x92;s additional two prongs.  See

						 While petitioner contends that a speaker on the Web possesses the ability to communicate only with individuals located in targeted geographic communities, Brief for Petitioner 29, n. 3, he stipulated below that &#x93;[o]nce a provider posts its content on the Internet and chooses to make it available to all, it generally cannot prevent that content from entering any geographic community.&#x94;  App. 187.

						 Although the phrase &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; appears only in the &#x93;prurient interest&#x94; prong of the Miller test, see Miller v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">24</a> (1973)
, this Court has indicated that the &#x93;patently offensive&#x94; prong of the test is also a question of fact to be decided by a jury applying contemporary community standards.  See, e.g., Pope v. Illinois, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/481/497" class="subref" title="subref">481 U. S. 497</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">500</a> (1987)
.  The parties here therefore agree that even though &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; are similarly mentioned only in the &#x93;prurient interest&#x94; prong of COPA&#x92;s harmful-to-minors definition, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#e_6_A" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(e)(6)(A)</a>, jurors will apply &#x93;contemporary community standards&#x94; as well in evaluating whether material is &#x93;patently offensive with respect to minors,&#x94; &#xA7;231(e)(6)(B).

						 While the CDA allowed juries to find material to be patently offensive so long as it depicted or described &#x93;sexual or excretory activities or organs,&#x94; COPA specifically delineates the sexual activities and anatomical features, the depictions of which may be found to be patently offensive: &#x93;an actual or simulated sexual act or sexual contact, an actual or simulated normal or perverted sexual act, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals or post-pubescent female breast.&#x94;

						 Justice Stevens argues that the &#x93;prurient interest&#x94; prong does not &#x93;substantially narrow the category of images covered&#x94; by COPA  because &#x93;[a]rguably every depiction of nudity&#x97;partial or full&#x97;is in some sense erotic with respect to minors,&#x94; post, at 6&#x96;7 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis in original).  We do not agree.  For example, we have great difficulty understanding how pictures of a war victim&#x92;s wounded nude body could reasonably be described under the vast majority of circumstances as erotic, especially when evaluated from the perspective of minors.  See Webster&#x92;s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 422 (1991) (defining erotic as &#x93;of, devoted to, or tending to arouse sexual love or desire&#x94;).

						 Justice Stevens contends that COPA&#x92;s serious value prong only marginally limits the sweep of the statute because it does not protect all material with serious value but just those works with serious value for minors.  See post, at 7.  His dissenting opinion, however, does not refer to any evidence supporting this counterintuitive assertion, and there is certainly none in the record suggesting that COPA restricts about the same amount of material as did the CDA.  Moreover, Justice Stevens does not dispute that COPA&#x92;s &#x93;serious value&#x94; prong serves the important purpose of allowing appellate courts to set &#x93;as a matter of law, a national floor for socially redeeming value.&#x94;  Reno, 521 U.

, a defendant could be prosecuted in any district through which obscene mail passed while it was on route to its destination, see id., at 143&#x96;144 (Brennan, J., dissenting), and a postal customer obviously lacked the ability to control the path his letter traveled as it made its way to its intended recipient.

						 Justice Stevens&#x92; contention that this Court &#x93;upheld the application of community standards to a nationwide medium&#x94; in Sable due to the fact that &#x93;[it] was at least possible&#x94; for dial-a-porn operators to tailor their messages to particular communities is inaccurate.  See post, at 4 (dissenting opinion).  This Court&#x92;s conclusion clearly did not hinge either on the fact that dial-a-porn operators could prevent callers in particular communities from accessing their messages or on an assessment of how burdensome it would have been for dial-a-porn operators to take that step.  Rather, these companies were required to abide by the standards of various communities for the sole reason that they transmitted their material into those communities.  See Sable, 492 U. S., at 126 (&#x93;If Sable&#x92;s audience is comprised of different communities with different local standards, Sable ultimately bears the burden of complying with the prohibition on obscene messages&#x94;).

						 In addition, COPA does not, as Justice Kennedy suggests, &#x93;foreclose an entire medium of expression.&#x94;  Post, at 6 (quoting City of Ladue v. Gilleo,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">55</a> (1994)
).  While Justice Kennedy and Justice Stevens repeatedly imply that COPA banishes from the Web material deemed harmful to minors by reference to community standards, see, e.g., post, at 6 (opinion concurring in judgment); post, at 7, 11 (dissenting opinion), the statute does no such thing.  It only requires that such material be placed behind adult identification screens.

						 Justice Stevens&#x92; conclusion to the contrary is based on little more than &#x93;speculation.&#x94;  See, e.g., post, at 8 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).  The only objective evidence cited in the dissenting opinion for the proposition that COPA &#x93;will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities&#x94; are various anecdotes compiled in an amici brief.  See post, at 10 (citing Brief for Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts et al. as Amici Curiae 4&#x96;10).  Justice Stevens, however, is not even willing to represent that these anecdotes relate to material restricted under COPA, see post, at 10, and we understand his reluctance for the vast majority of the works cited in that brief, if not all of them, are likely unaffected by the statute.  See Brief for Volunteer Lawyer for the Arts et al. as Amici Curiae 4&#x96;10 (describing, among other incidents, controversies in various communities regarding Maya Angelou&#x92;s I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, Judy Blume&#x92;s Are You There God? It&#x92;s Me, Margaret, Aldous Huxley&#x92;s Brave New World, J.D. Salinger&#x92;s Catcher in the Rye, 1993 Academy Award Best Picture nominee The Piano, the American Broadcasting Corporation television network&#x92;s NYPD Blue, and songs of the &#x93;popular folk-rock duo&#x94; the Indigo Girls).  These anecdotes are therefore of questionable relevance to the matter at hand and certainly do not constitute a sufficient basis for invalidating a federal statute.


Moreover, we do not agree with Justice Kennedy&#x92;s suggestion that it is necessary for the Court of Appeals to revisit this question upon remand.  See post, at 8&#x96;9.  The lack of evidence in the record relevant to the question presented does not indicate that &#x93;we should vacate for further consideration.&#x94;  Post, at 9.  Rather, it indicates that respondents, by offering little more than &#x93;speculation,&#x94; have failed to meet their burden of demonstrating in this facial challenge that COPA&#x92;s reliance on community standards renders the statute substantially overbroad.

				I agree with the plurality that even if obscenity on the Internet is defined in terms of local community standards, respondents have not shown that the Child Online Protection Act (COPA) is overbroad solely on the basis of the variation in the standards of different communities.  See

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The plurality&#x92;s opinion argues that, even under local community standards, the variation between the most and least restrictive communities is not so great with respect to the narrow category of speech covered by COPA as to, alone, render the statute substantially overbroad.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 13&#x96;15.  I agree, given respondents&#x92; failure to provide examples of materials that lack literary, artistic, political, and scientific value for minors, which would nonetheless result in variation among communities judging the other elements of the test.  Respondents&#x92; examples of material for which community standards would vary include such things as the appropriateness of sex education and the desirability of adoption by same-sex couples.  Brief for Respondents 43.  Material addressing the latter topic, however, seems highly unlikely to be seen to appeal to the prurient interest in any community, and educational material like the former must, on any objective inquiry, see 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 15, have scientific value for minors.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But respondents&#x92; failure to prove substantial overbreadth on a facial challenge in this case still leaves open the possibility that the use of local community standards will cause problems for regulation of obscenity on the Internet, for adults as well as children, in future cases.  In an as-applied challenge, for instance, individual litigants may still dispute that the standards of a community more restrictive than theirs should apply to them.  And in future facial challenges to regulation of obscenity on the Internet, litigants may make a more convincing case for substantial overbreadth.  Where adult speech is concerned, for instance, there may in fact be a greater degree of disagreement about what is patently offensive or appeals to the prurient interest.

				obscenity.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Our precedents do not forbid adoption of a national standard.  Local community-based standards originated with 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					California,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a> (1973)
.  In that case, we approved jury instructions that based the relevant &#x93;community standards&#x94; on those of the State of California rather than on the Nation as a whole.  In doing so, we held that &#x93;[n]othing in the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> requires&#x94; that a jury consider national standards when determining if something is obscene as a matter of fact.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 31.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>, we held, did not require that &#x93;the people of Maine or Mississippi accept public depiction of conduct found tolerable in Las Vegas, or New York City.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 32.  But we said nothing about the constitutionality of jury instructions that would contemplate a national standard&#x97;
				<em>
					i.e.
				</em>
				, requiring that the people who live in all of these places hold themselves to what the nationwide community of adults would find was patently offensive and appealed to the prurient interest.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Later, in 
				<em>
					Jenkins
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Georgia,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/418/153" class="subref" title="subref">418 U. S. 153</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">157</a> (1974)
, we confirmed that &#x93;
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 approved the use of [instructions based on local standards]; it did not mandate their use.&#x94;  The instructions we approved in that case charged the jury with applying &#x93;community standards&#x94; without designating any particular &#x93;community.&#x94;  In holding that a State may define the obscenity standard by stating the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 standard without further specification, 418 U. S., at 157, 
				<em>
					Jenkins
				</em>
				 left open the possibility that jurors would apply any number of standards, including a national standard, in evaluating material&#x92;s obscenity.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To be sure, the Court in 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 also stated that a national standard might be &#x93;unascertainable,&#x94; 413 U. S., at 31, and &#x93;[un]realistic,&#x94; 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 32.  But where speech on the Internet is concerned, I do not share that skepticism.  It is true that our Nation is diverse, but many local communities encompass a similar diversity.  For instance, in 
				<em>
					Miller 
				</em>
				itself, the jury was instructed to consider the standards of the entire State of California, a large (today, it has a population of greater than 33 million people, see U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 23 (120th ed. 2000) (Table 20)) and diverse State that includes both Berkeley and Bakersfield.  If the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 Court believed generalizations about the standards of the people of California were possible, and that jurors would be capable of assessing them, it is difficult to believe that similar generalizations are not also possible for the Nation as a whole.  Moreover, the existence of the Internet, and its facilitation of national dialogue, has itself made jurors more aware of the views of adults in other parts of the United States.  Although jurors asked to evaluate the obscenity of speech based on a national standard will inevitably base their assessments to some extent on their experience of their local communities, I agree with 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				 that the lesser degree of variation that would result is inherent in the jury system and does not necessarily pose a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> problem.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 2.  In my view, a national standard is not only constitutionally permissible, but also reasonable.

				But respondents&#x92; failure to prove substantial overbreadth on a facial challenge in this case still leaves open the possibility that the use of local community standards will cause problems for regulation of obscenity on the Internet, for adults as well as children, in future cases.  In an as-applied challenge, for instance, individual litigants may still dispute that the standards of a community more restrictive than theirs should apply to them.  And in future facial challenges to regulation of obscenity on the Internet, litigants may make a more convincing case for substantial overbreadth.  Where adult speech is concerned, for instance, there may in fact be a greater degree of disagreement about what is patently offensive or appeals to the prurient interest.

				To be sure, the Court in

				<em>

				itself, the jury was instructed to consider the standards of the entire State of California, a large (today, it has a population of greater than 33 million people, see U. S.

				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 Court believed generalizations about the standards of the people of California were possible, and that jurors would be capable of assessing them, it is difficult to believe that similar generalizations are not also possible for the Nation as a whole.  Moreover, the existence of the Internet, and its facilitation of national dialogue, has itself made jurors more aware of the views of adults in other parts of the United States.  Although jurors asked to evaluate the obscenity of speech based on a national standard will inevitably base their assessments to some extent on their experience of their local communities, I agree with 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				The plurality&#x92;s opinion argues that, even under local community standards, the variation between the most and least restrictive communities is not so great with respect to the narrow category of speech covered by COPA as to, alone, render the statute substantially overbroad.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 13&#x96;15.  I agree, given respondents&#x92; failure to provide examples of materials that lack literary, artistic, political, and scientific value for minors, which would nonetheless result in variation among communities judging the other elements of the test.  Respondents&#x92; examples of material for which community standards would vary include such things as the appropriateness of sex education and the desirability of adoption by same-sex couples.  Brief for Respondents 43.  Material addressing the latter topic, however, seems highly unlikely to be seen to appeal to the prurient interest in any community, and educational material like the former must, on any objective inquiry, see 
				<em>

				, at 15, have scientific value for minors.

				But respondents&#x92; failure to prove substantial overbreadth on a facial challenge in this case still leaves open the possibility that the use of local community standards will cause problems for regulation of obscenity on the Internet, for adults as well as children, in future cases.  In an as-applied challenge, for instance, individual litigants may still dispute that the standards of a community more restrictive than theirs should apply to them.  And in future facial challenges to regulation of obscenity on the Internet, litigants may make a more convincing case for substantial overbreadth.  Where adult speech is concerned, for instance, there may in fact be a greater degree of disagreement about what is patently offensive or appeals to the prurient interest.

				The plurality&#x92;s opinion argues that, even under local community standards, the variation between the most and least restrictive communities is not so great with respect to the narrow category of speech covered by COPA as to, alone, render the statute substantially overbroad.  See 
				<em>

I agree, given respondents&#x92; failure to provide examples of materials that lack literary, artistic, political, and scientific value for minors, which would nonetheless result in variation among communities judging the other elements of the test.  Respondents&#x92; examples of material for which community standards would vary include such things as the appropriateness of sex education and the desirability of adoption by same-sex couples.

				But respondents&#x92; failure to prove substantial overbreadth on a facial challenge in this case still leaves open the possibility that the use of local community standards will cause problems for regulation of obscenity on the Internet, for adults as well as children, in future cases.  In an as-applied challenge, for instance, individual litigants may still dispute that the standards of a community more restrictive than theirs should apply to them.  And in future facial challenges to regulation of obscenity on the Internet, litigants may make a more convincing case for substantial overbreadth.  Where adult speech is concerned, for instance, there may in fact be a greater degree of disagreement about what is patently offensive or appeals to the prurient interest.

				Later, in 
				<em>
					Jenkins

				 v. 
				<em>
					Georgia,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/418/153" class="subref" title="subref">418 U. S. 153</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">157</a> (1974)
, we confirmed that &#x93;
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 approved the use of [instructions based on local standards]; it did not mandate their use.&#x94;  The instructions we approved in that case charged the jury with applying &#x93;community standards&#x94; without designating any particular &#x93;community.&#x94;  In holding that a State may define the obscenity standard by stating the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 standard without further specification, 418 U. S., at 157, 
				<em>
					Jenkins
				</em>
				 left open the possibility that jurors would apply any number of standards, including a national standard, in evaluating material&#x92;s obscenity.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				To be sure, the Court in 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 also stated that a national standard might be &#x93;unascertainable,&#x94; 413 U. S., at 31, and &#x93;[un]realistic,&#x94; 
				<em>

				 at 32.  But where speech on the Internet is concerned, I do not share that skepticism.  It is true that our Nation is diverse, but many local communities encompass a similar diversity.  For instance, in 
				<em>
					Miller 
				</em>
				itself, the jury was instructed to consider the standards of the entire State of California, a large (today, it has a population of greater than 33 million people, see U. S. Dept. of Commerce, Bureau of Census, Statistical Abstract of the United States 23 (120th ed. 2000) (Table 20)) and diverse State that includes both Berkeley and Bakersfield.  If the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 Court believed generalizations about the standards of the people of California were possible, and that jurors would be capable of assessing them, it is difficult to believe that similar generalizations are not also possible for the Nation as a whole.  Moreover, the existence of the Internet, and its facilitation of national dialogue, has itself made jurors more aware of the views of adults in other parts of the United States.  Although jurors asked to evaluate the obscenity of speech based on a national standard will inevitably base their assessments to some extent on their experience of their local communities, I agree with 
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Justice Breyer
				</span>
				 that the lesser degree of variation that would result is inherent in the jury system and does not necessarily pose a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> problem.  See

				itself, the jury was instructed to consider the standards of the entire State of California, a large (today, it has a population of greater than 33 million people, see U. S.

				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 Court believed generalizations about the standards of the people of California were possible, and that jurors would be capable of assessing them, it is difficult to believe that similar generalizations are not also possible for the Nation as a whole.  Moreover, the existence of the Internet, and its facilitation of national dialogue, has itself made jurors more aware of the views of adults in other parts of the United States.  Although jurors asked to evaluate the obscenity of speech based on a national standard will inevitably base their assessments to some extent on their experience of their local communities, I agree with 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				Appeals to prurient interests are commonplace on the Internet, as in older media.  Many of those appeals lack serious value for minors as well as adults.  Some are offensive to certain viewers but welcomed by others.  For decades, our cases have recognized that the standards for judging their acceptability vary from viewer to viewer and from community to community.  Those cases developed the requirement that communications should be protected if they do not violate contemporary community standards.  In its original form, the community standard provided a shield for communications that are offensive only to the least tolerant members of society.  Thus, the Court &#x93;has emphasized on more than one occasion that a principal concern in requiring that a judgment be made on the basis of &#x92;contemporary community standards&#x92; is to assure that the material is judged neither on the basis of each juror&#x92;s personal opinion, nor by its effect on a particularly sensitive or insensitive person or group.&#x94;

				COPA not only restricts speech that is made available to the general public, it also covers a medium in which speech cannot be segregated to avoid communities where it is likely to be considered harmful to minors.  The Internet presents a unique forum for communication because information, once posted, is accessible everywhere on the network at once.  The speaker cannot control access based on the location of the listener, nor can it choose the pathways through which its speech is transmitted.

				Petitioner&#x92;s argument that the &#x93;serious value&#x94; prong minimizes the statute&#x92;s overbreadth is also unpersuasive.  Although we have recognized that the serious value determination in obscenity cases should be based on an objective, reasonable person standard,

				</em>
				, they do not necessarily have any such value for 
				<em>
					minors
				</em>
				&#x94;).  Thus, even though the serious value prong limits the total amount of speech covered by the statute, it remains true that there is a significant amount of protected speech within the category of materials that have no serious value for minors.  That speech is effectively prohibited whenever the least tolerant communities find it harmful to minors.

				  While the objective nature of the inquiry may eliminate any worry that the serious value determination will be made by the least tolerant community, it does not change the fact that, within the subset of images deemed to have no serious value for minors, the decision whether minors and adults throughout the country will have access to that speech will still be made by the most restrictive community.

According to his view, we cannot determine whether the statute is substantially overbroad based on its use of community standards without first determining how much of the speech on the Internet is saved by the other restrictions in the statute.

				&#x94; (Emphasis added.)  Regardless of how the Court of Appeals interprets the &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; or &#x93;as a whole&#x94; provisions on remand, the question we must answer is whether the statute restricts a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its legitimate sweep by virtue of the fact that it uses community standards.

				  These other provisions may reduce the absolute number of Web pages covered by the statute, but even the narrowest version of the statute abridges a substantial amount of protected speech that many communities would not find harmful to minors.

				Even if most, if not all, of these works would be excluded from COPA&#x92;s coverage by the serious value prong, they illustrate the diversity of public opinion on the underlying themes depicted.  This diversity of views surely extends to whether materials with the same themes, that do not have serious value for minors, appeal to their prurient interests and are patently offensive.  There is no reason to think the differences between communities&#x92; standards will disappear once the image or description is no longer within the context of a work that has serious value for minors.

				  Because communities differ widely in their attitudes toward sex, particularly when minors are concerned, the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that, regardless of how COPA&#x92;s other provisions are construed, applying community standards to the Internet will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities.              
			</p>

				Whether that consequence is appropriate depends, of course, on the content of the message.  The kind of hard-core pornography involved in 
				<em>
					Hamling
				</em>
				, which I assume would be obscene under any community&#x92;s standard, does not belong on the Internet.  Perhaps &#x93;teasers&#x94; that serve no function except to invite viewers to examine hardcore materials, or the hidden terms written into a Web site&#x92;s &#x93;metatags&#x94; in order to dupe unwitting Web surfers into visiting pornographic sites, deserve the same fate.  But COPA extends to a wide range of prurient appeals in advertisements, online magazines, Web-based bulletin boards and chat rooms, stock photo galleries, Web diaries, and a variety of illustrations encompassing a vast number of messages that are unobjectionable in most of the country and yet provide no &#x93;serious value&#x94; for minors.  It is quite wrong to allow the standards of a minority consisting of the least tolerant communities to regulate access to relatively harmless messages in this burgeoning market.

				In the context of most other media, using community standards to differentiate between permissible and impermissible speech has two virtues.  As mentioned above, community standards originally served as a shield to protect speakers from the least tolerant members of society.  By aggregating values at the community level, the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 test eliminated the outliers at both ends of the spectrum and provided some predictability as to what constitutes obscene speech.  But community standards also serve as a shield to protect audience members, by allowing people to self-sort based on their preferences.  Those who abhor and those who tolerate sexually explicit speech can seek out like-minded people and settle in communities that share their views on what is acceptable for themselves and their children.  This sorting mechanism, however, does not exist in cyberspace; the audience cannot self-segregate.  As a result, in the context of the Internet this shield also becomes a sword, because the community that wishes to live without certain material not only rids itself, but the entire Internet of the offending speech.

						 Petitioner cites examples of display statutes in 23 States that require magazine racks to shield minors from the covers of pornographic magazines.  Brief for Petitioner 22, 3a.  This Court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of any of these statutes, which are in any event of little relevance to regulation of speech on the Internet.  As we recognized in ACLU I,

						 It is hardly a solution to say, as Justice Thomas suggests, ante, at 19, that a speaker need only choose a different medium in order to avoid having its speech judged by the least tolerant community.  Our overbreadth doctrine would quickly become a toothless protection if we were to hold that substituting a more limited forum for expression is an acceptable price to pay.  Since a content-based restriction is presumptively invalid, I would place the burden on parents to &#x93;take the simple step of utilizing a medium that enables,&#x94; ante, at 19, them to avoid this material before requiring the speaker to find another forum.

						 Justice Breyer seeks to avoid the problem by effectively reading the phrase &#x93;contemporary national standards&#x94; into the statute, ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  While the legislative history of COPA provides some support for this reading, it is contradicted by the clear text of the statute, which directs jurors to consider &#x93;community&#x94; standards.  This phrase is a term of art that has taken on a particular meaning in light of our precedent.  Although we have never held that applying a national standard would be constitutionally impermissible, we have said that asking a jury to do so is &#x93;an exercise in futility,&#x94; Miller v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">30</a> (1973)
, and that &#x93;[a] juror is entitled to draw on his own knowledge of the views of the average person in the community or vicinage from which he comes for making the required determination,&#x94; Hamling v. United States,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a> (1974)
.  Any lingering doubts about the meaning of the phrase were certainly dispelled by our discussion of the issue in ACLU I, 521 U. S., at 874, n. 39, and we presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of our decisions.  Therefore, Justice Thomas has correctly refused to rewrite the statute to substitute a standard that Congress clearly did not choose.  And even if the Court were willing to do so, we would still have to acknowledge, as petitioner does, that jurors instructed to apply a national, or adult, standard, will reach widely different conclusions throughout the country, see ante, at 12; Brief for Petitioner 39.

						 Of course, Justice Thomas&#x92;s example of the image &#x93;of a war victim&#x92;s wounded nude body,&#x94; ante, at 15, n. 9, would not be covered by the statute unless it depicted &#x93;a lewd exhibition of the genitals or post-pubescent female breast&#x94; and lacked serious political value for minors,

						 The Court also notes that the limitation to communications made for commercial purposes narrows the category of speech as compared to the CDA, ante, at 5.  While it is certainly true that this condition limits the scope of the statute, the phrase &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; is somewhat misleading.  The definition of commercial purposes, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#e_2_B" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(e)(2)(B)</a>, covers anyone who generates revenue from advertisements or merchandise, regardless of the amount of advertising or whether the advertisements or products are related to the images that allegedly are harmful to minors.  As the District Court noted: &#x93;There is nothing in the text of the COPA, however, that limits its applicability to so-called commercial pornographers only; indeed, the text of COPA imposes liability on a speaker who knowingly makes any communication for commercial purposes &#x91;that includes any material that is harmful to minors,&#x92; &#x94; App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a.  In the context of the Internet, this is hardly a serious limitation.  A 1998 study, for example, found that 83 percent of Web sites contain commercial content.  Lawrence &amp; Giles, Accessibility of information of the web, 400 Nature 107&#x96;109 (1999); Guernsey, Seek&#x97;but on the Web, You Might Not Find, N. Y. Times, July 8, 1999, p. G3.  Interestingly, this same study found that only 1.5 percent of the 2.8 million sites cataloged contained pornographic content.

						 Justice Kennedy accuses the Court of Appeals of evaluating overbreadth in a vacuum by dismissing most of the concerns raised by the District Court, ante, at 8.  But most of those concerns went to whether COPA survives strict scrutiny, not overbreadth.  Even under Justice Kennedy&#x92;s formulation, it is unclear why it is relevant to an overbreadth analysis, for example, whether COPA could have been more narrowly tailored, whether the affirmative defenses impose too great a burden, or whether inclusion of criminal as well as civil penalties was excessive.

				Appeals to prurient interests are commonplace on the Internet, as in older media.  Many of those appeals lack serious value for minors as well as adults.  Some are offensive to certain viewers but welcomed by others.  For decades, our cases have recognized that the standards for judging their acceptability vary from viewer to viewer and from community to community.  Those cases developed the requirement that communications should be protected if they do not violate contemporary community standards.  In its original form, the community standard provided a shield for communications that are offensive only to the least tolerant members of society.  Thus, the Court &#x93;has emphasized on more than one occasion that a principal concern in requiring that a judgment be made on the basis of &#x92;contemporary community standards&#x92; is to assure that the material is judged neither on the basis of each juror&#x92;s personal opinion, nor by its effect on a particularly sensitive or insensitive person or group.&#x94;

				COPA not only restricts speech that is made available to the general public, it also covers a medium in which speech cannot be segregated to avoid communities where it is likely to be considered harmful to minors.  The Internet presents a unique forum for communication because information, once posted, is accessible everywhere on the network at once.  The speaker cannot control access based on the location of the listener, nor can it choose the pathways through which its speech is transmitted.  By approving the use of community standards in this context,

It is true that, in addition to COPA&#x92;s &#x93;appeals to the prurient interest of minors&#x94; prong, the material must be &#x93;patently offensive with respect to minors&#x94; and it must lack &#x93;serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.&#x94;

				<em>

				&#x94;).  Thus, even though the serious value prong limits the total amount of speech covered by the statute, it remains true that there is a significant amount of protected speech within the category of materials that have no serious value for minors.  That speech is effectively prohibited whenever the least tolerant communities find it harmful to minors.

				  While the objective nature of the inquiry may eliminate any worry that the serious value determination will be made by the least tolerant community, it does not change the fact that, within the subset of images deemed to have no serious value for minors, the decision whether minors and adults throughout the country will have access to that speech will still be made by the most restrictive community.

According to his view, we cannot determine whether the statute is substantially overbroad based on its use of community standards without first determining how much of the speech on the Internet is saved by the other restrictions in the statute.  But this represents a fundamental misconception of our overbreadth doctrine.  As Justice White explained in

				&#x94; (Emphasis added.)  Regardless of how the Court of Appeals interprets the &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; or &#x93;as a whole&#x94; provisions on remand, the question we must answer is whether the statute restricts a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its legitimate sweep by virtue of the fact that it uses community standards.

				  These other provisions may reduce the absolute number of Web pages covered by the statute, but even the narrowest version of the statute abridges a substantial amount of protected speech that many communities would not find harmful to minors.

				Even if most, if not all, of these works would be excluded from COPA&#x92;s coverage by the serious value prong, they illustrate the diversity of public opinion on the underlying themes depicted.  This diversity of views surely extends to whether materials with the same themes, that do not have serious value for minors, appeal to their prurient interests and are patently offensive.  There is no reason to think the differences between communities&#x92; standards will disappear once the image or description is no longer within the context of a work that has serious value for minors.

				  Because communities differ widely in their attitudes toward sex, particularly when minors are concerned, the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that, regardless of how COPA&#x92;s other provisions are construed, applying community standards to the Internet will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities.

				Whether that consequence is appropriate depends, of course, on the content of the message.  The kind of hard-core pornography involved in 
				<em>
					Hamling
				</em>
				, which I assume would be obscene under any community&#x92;s standard, does not belong on the Internet.  Perhaps &#x93;teasers&#x94; that serve no function except to invite viewers to examine hardcore materials, or the hidden terms written into a Web site&#x92;s &#x93;metatags&#x94; in order to dupe unwitting Web surfers into visiting pornographic sites, deserve the same fate.  But COPA extends to a wide range of prurient appeals in advertisements, online magazines, Web-based bulletin boards and chat rooms, stock photo galleries, Web diaries, and a variety of illustrations encompassing a vast number of messages that are unobjectionable in most of the country and yet provide no &#x93;serious value&#x94; for minors.  It is quite wrong to allow the standards of a minority consisting of the least tolerant communities to regulate access to relatively harmless messages in this burgeoning market.

				In the context of most other media, using community standards to differentiate between permissible and impermissible speech has two virtues.  As mentioned above, community standards originally served as a shield to protect speakers from the least tolerant members of society.  By aggregating values at the community level, the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 test eliminated the outliers at both ends of the spectrum and provided some predictability as to what constitutes obscene speech.  But community standards also serve as a shield to protect audience members, by allowing people to self-sort based on their preferences.  Those who abhor and those who tolerate sexually explicit speech can seek out like-minded people and settle in communities that share their views on what is acceptable for themselves and their children.  This sorting mechanism, however, does not exist in cyberspace; the audience cannot self-segregate.  As a result, in the context of the Internet this shield also becomes a sword, because the community that wishes to live without certain material not only rids itself, but the entire Internet of the offending speech.

						 Petitioner cites examples of display statutes in 23 States that require magazine racks to shield minors from the covers of pornographic magazines.  Brief for Petitioner 22, 3a.  This Court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of any of these statutes, which are in any event of little relevance to regulation of speech on the Internet.  As we recognized in ACLU I,

						 It is hardly a solution to say, as Justice Thomas suggests, ante, at 19, that a speaker need only choose a different medium in order to avoid having its speech judged by the least tolerant community.  Our overbreadth doctrine would quickly become a toothless protection if we were to hold that substituting a more limited forum for expression is an acceptable price to pay.  Since a content-based restriction is presumptively invalid, I would place the burden on parents to &#x93;take the simple step of utilizing a medium that enables,&#x94; ante, at 19, them to avoid this material before requiring the speaker to find another forum.

						 Justice Breyer seeks to avoid the problem by effectively reading the phrase &#x93;contemporary national standards&#x94; into the statute, ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  While the legislative history of COPA provides some support for this reading, it is contradicted by the clear text of the statute, which directs jurors to consider &#x93;community&#x94; standards.  This phrase is a term of art that has taken on a particular meaning in light of our precedent.  Although we have never held that applying a national standard would be constitutionally impermissible, we have said that asking a jury to do so is &#x93;an exercise in futility,&#x94; Miller v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">30</a> (1973)

.  Any lingering doubts about the meaning of the phrase were certainly dispelled by our discussion of the issue in ACLU I, 521 U. S., at 874, n. 39, and we presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of our decisions.  Therefore, Justice Thomas has correctly refused to rewrite the statute to substitute a standard that Congress clearly did not choose.  And even if the Court were willing to do so, we would still have to acknowledge, as petitioner does, that jurors instructed to apply a national, or adult, standard, will reach widely different conclusions throughout the country, see ante, at 12; Brief for Petitioner 39.

						 The Court also notes that the limitation to communications made for commercial purposes narrows the category of speech as compared to the CDA, ante, at 5.  While it is certainly true that this condition limits the scope of the statute, the phrase &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; is somewhat misleading.  The definition of commercial purposes, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#e_2_B" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(e)(2)(B)</a>, covers anyone who generates revenue from advertisements or merchandise, regardless of the amount of advertising or whether the advertisements or products are related to the images that allegedly are harmful to minors.  As the District Court noted: &#x93;There is nothing in the text of the COPA, however, that limits its applicability to so-called commercial pornographers only; indeed, the text of COPA imposes liability on a speaker who knowingly makes any communication for commercial purposes &#x91;that includes any material that is harmful to minors,&#x92; &#x94; App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a.  In the context of the Internet, this is hardly a serious limitation.  A 1998 study, for example, found that 83 percent of Web sites contain commercial content.  Lawrence &amp; Giles, Accessibility of information of the web, 400 Nature 107&#x96;109 (1999); Guernsey, Seek&#x97;but on the Web, You Might Not Find, N. Y. Times, July 8, 1999, p. G3.  Interestingly, this same study found that only 1.5 percent of the 2.8 million sites cataloged contained pornographic content.

						 Justice Kennedy accuses the Court of Appeals of evaluating overbreadth in a vacuum by dismissing most of the concerns raised by the District Court, ante, at 8.  But most of those concerns went to whether COPA survives strict scrutiny, not overbreadth.  Even under Justice Kennedy&#x92;s formulation, it is unclear why it is relevant to an overbreadth analysis, for example, whether COPA could have been more narrowly tailored, whether the affirmative defenses impose too great a burden, or whether inclusion of criminal as well as civil penalties was excessive.

				Appeals to prurient interests are commonplace on the Internet, as in older media.  Many of those appeals lack serious value for minors as well as adults.  Some are offensive to certain viewers but welcomed by others.  For decades, our cases have recognized that the standards for judging their acceptability vary from viewer to viewer and from community to community.  Those cases developed the requirement that communications should be protected if they do not violate contemporary community standards.  In its original form, the community standard provided a shield for communications that are offensive only to the least tolerant members of society.  Thus, the Court &#x93;has emphasized on more than one occasion that a principal concern in requiring that a judgment be made on the basis of &#x92;contemporary community standards&#x92; is to assure that the material is judged neither on the basis of each juror&#x92;s personal opinion, nor by its effect on a particularly sensitive or insensitive person or group.&#x94;

				COPA not only restricts speech that is made available to the general public, it also covers a medium in which speech cannot be segregated to avoid communities where it is likely to be considered harmful to minors.  The Internet presents a unique forum for communication because information, once posted, is accessible everywhere on the network at once.  The speaker cannot control access based on the location of the listener, nor can it choose the pathways through which its speech is transmitted.  By approving the use of community standards in this context,

				Petitioner&#x92;s argument that the &#x93;serious value&#x94; prong minimizes the statute&#x92;s overbreadth is also unpersuasive.  Although we have recognized that the serious value determination in obscenity cases should be based on an objective, reasonable person standard,

, formulation of the serious value prong.  The question for the jury is not whether a reasonable person would conclude that the materials have serious value; instead, the jury must determine whether the materials have serious value 
				<em>

				</em>
				.  Congress reasonably concluded that a substantial number of works, which have serious value for adults, do not have serious value for minors.  Cf.

				<em>
					adults
				</em>
				, they do not necessarily have any such value for 
				<em>
					minors
				</em>
				&#x94;).  Thus, even though the serious value prong limits the total amount of speech covered by the statute, it remains true that there is a significant amount of protected speech within the category of materials that have no serious value for minors.  That speech is effectively prohibited whenever the least tolerant communities find it harmful to minors.

				  While the objective nature of the inquiry may eliminate any worry that the serious value determination will be made by the least tolerant community, it does not change the fact that, within the subset of images deemed to have no serious value for minors, the decision whether minors and adults throughout the country will have access to that speech will still be made by the most restrictive community.

According to his view, we cannot determine whether the statute is substantially overbroad based on its use of community standards without first determining how much of the speech on the Internet is saved by the other restrictions in the statute.  But this represents a fundamental misconception of our overbreadth doctrine.  As Justice White explained in

				</em>
				&#x94; (Emphasis added.)  Regardless of how the Court of Appeals interprets the &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; or &#x93;as a whole&#x94; provisions on remand, the question we must answer is whether the statute restricts a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its legitimate sweep by virtue of the fact that it uses community standards.

				  These other provisions may reduce the absolute number of Web pages covered by the statute, but even the narrowest version of the statute abridges a substantial amount of protected speech that many communities would not find harmful to minors.  Because Web speakers cannot limit access to those specific communities, the statute is substantially overbroad regardless of how its other provisions are construed.

				Even if most, if not all, of these works would be excluded from COPA&#x92;s coverage by the serious value prong, they illustrate the diversity of public opinion on the underlying themes depicted.  This diversity of views surely extends to whether materials with the same themes, that do not have serious value for minors, appeal to their prurient interests and are patently offensive.  There is no reason to think the differences between communities&#x92; standards will disappear once the image or description is no longer within the context of a work that has serious value for minors.

				  Because communities differ widely in their attitudes toward sex, particularly when minors are concerned, the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that, regardless of how COPA&#x92;s other provisions are construed, applying community standards to the Internet will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities.

				Whether that consequence is appropriate depends, of course, on the content of the message.  The kind of hard-core pornography involved in 
				<em>
					Hamling
				</em>
				, which I assume would be obscene under any community&#x92;s standard, does not belong on the Internet.  Perhaps &#x93;teasers&#x94; that serve no function except to invite viewers to examine hardcore materials, or the hidden terms written into a Web site&#x92;s &#x93;metatags&#x94; in order to dupe unwitting Web surfers into visiting pornographic sites, deserve the same fate.  But COPA extends to a wide range of prurient appeals in advertisements, online magazines, Web-based bulletin boards and chat rooms, stock photo galleries, Web diaries, and a variety of illustrations encompassing a vast number of messages that are unobjectionable in most of the country and yet provide no &#x93;serious value&#x94; for minors.  It is quite wrong to allow the standards of a minority consisting of the least tolerant communities to regulate access to relatively harmless messages in this burgeoning market.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the context of most other media, using community standards to differentiate between permissible and impermissible speech has two virtues.  As mentioned above, community standards originally served as a shield to protect speakers from the least tolerant members of society.  By aggregating values at the community level, the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 test eliminated the outliers at both ends of the spectrum and provided some predictability as to what constitutes obscene speech.  But community standards also serve as a shield to protect audience members, by allowing people to self-sort based on their preferences.  Those who abhor and those who tolerate sexually explicit speech can seek out like-minded people and settle in communities that share their views on what is acceptable for themselves and their children.  This sorting mechanism, however, does not exist in cyberspace; the audience cannot self-segregate.  As a result, in the context of the Internet this shield also becomes a sword, because the community that wishes to live without certain material not only rids itself, but the entire Internet of the offending speech.

						 It is hardly a solution to say, as Justice Thomas suggests, ante, at 19, that a speaker need only choose a different medium in order to avoid having its speech judged by the least tolerant community.  Our overbreadth doctrine would quickly become a toothless protection if we were to hold that substituting a more limited forum for expression is an acceptable price to pay.  Since a content-based restriction is presumptively invalid, I would place the burden on parents to &#x93;take the simple step of utilizing a medium that enables,&#x94; ante, at 19, them to avoid this material before requiring the speaker to find another forum.

						 Justice Breyer seeks to avoid the problem by effectively reading the phrase &#x93;contemporary national standards&#x94; into the statute, ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  While the legislative history of COPA provides some support for this reading, it is contradicted by the clear text of the statute, which directs jurors to consider &#x93;community&#x94; standards.  This phrase is a term of art that has taken on a particular meaning in light of our precedent.  Although we have never held that applying a national standard would be constitutionally impermissible, we have said that asking a jury to do so is &#x93;an exercise in futility,&#x94; Miller v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">30</a> (1973)

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a> (1974)
.  Any lingering doubts about the meaning of the phrase were certainly dispelled by our discussion of the issue in ACLU I, 521 U. S., at 874, n. 39, and we presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of our decisions.  Therefore, Justice Thomas has correctly refused to rewrite the statute to substitute a standard that Congress clearly did not choose.  And even if the Court were willing to do so, we would still have to acknowledge, as petitioner does, that jurors instructed to apply a national, or adult, standard, will reach widely different conclusions throughout the country, see ante, at 12; Brief for Petitioner 39.

						 The Court also notes that the limitation to communications made for commercial purposes narrows the category of speech as compared to the CDA, ante, at 5.  While it is certainly true that this condition limits the scope of the statute, the phrase &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; is somewhat misleading.  The definition of commercial purposes, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#e_2_B" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(e)(2)(B)</a>, covers anyone who generates revenue from advertisements or merchandise, regardless of the amount of advertising or whether the advertisements or products are related to the images that allegedly are harmful to minors.  As the District Court noted: &#x93;There is nothing in the text of the COPA, however, that limits its applicability to so-called commercial pornographers only; indeed, the text of COPA imposes liability on a speaker who knowingly makes any communication for commercial purposes &#x91;that includes any material that is harmful to minors,&#x92; &#x94; App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a.  In the context of the Internet, this is hardly a serious limitation.  A 1998 study, for example, found that 83 percent of Web sites contain commercial content.  Lawrence &amp; Giles, Accessibility of information of the web, 400 Nature 107&#x96;109 (1999); Guernsey, Seek&#x97;but on the Web, You Might Not Find, N. Y. Times, July 8, 1999, p. G3.  Interestingly, this same study found that only 1.5 percent of the 2.8 million sites cataloged contained pornographic content.

						 Justice Kennedy accuses the Court of Appeals of evaluating overbreadth in a vacuum by dismissing most of the concerns raised by the District Court, ante, at 8.  But most of those concerns went to whether COPA survives strict scrutiny, not overbreadth.  Even under Justice Kennedy&#x92;s formulation, it is unclear why it is relevant to an overbreadth analysis, for example, whether COPA could have been more narrowly tailored, whether the affirmative defenses impose too great a burden, or whether inclusion of criminal as well as civil penalties was excessive.

				Appeals to prurient interests are commonplace on the Internet, as in older media.  Many of those appeals lack serious value for minors as well as adults.  Some are offensive to certain viewers but welcomed by others.  For decades, our cases have recognized that the standards for judging their acceptability vary from viewer to viewer and from community to community.  Those cases developed the requirement that communications should be protected if they do not violate contemporary community standards.  In its original form, the community standard provided a shield for communications that are offensive only to the least tolerant members of society.  Thus, the Court &#x93;has emphasized on more than one occasion that a principal concern in requiring that a judgment be made on the basis of &#x92;contemporary community standards&#x92; is to assure that the material is judged neither on the basis of each juror&#x92;s personal opinion, nor by its effect on a particularly sensitive or insensitive person or group.&#x94;

.  In the context of the Internet, however, community standards become a sword, rather than a shield.  If a prurient appeal is offensive in a puritan village, it may be a crime to post it on the World Wide Web.

				COPA not only restricts speech that is made available to the general public, it also covers a medium in which speech cannot be segregated to avoid communities where it is likely to be considered harmful to minors.  The Internet presents a unique forum for communication because information, once posted, is accessible everywhere on the network at once.  The speaker cannot control access based on the location of the listener, nor can it choose the pathways through which its speech is transmitted.  By approving the use of community standards in this context,

It is true that, in addition to COPA&#x92;s &#x93;appeals to the prurient interest of minors&#x94; prong, the material must be &#x93;patently offensive with respect to minors&#x94; and it must lack &#x93;serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.&#x94;

Whatever disparity exists between various communities&#x92; assessment of the content that appeals to the prurient interest of minors will surely be matched by their differing opinions as to whether descriptions of sexual acts or depictions of nudity are patently offensive with respect to minors.

				Petitioner&#x92;s argument that the &#x93;serious value&#x94; prong minimizes the statute&#x92;s overbreadth is also unpersuasive.  Although we have recognized that the serious value determination in obscenity cases should be based on an objective, reasonable person standard,

				<em>

				</em>
				.  Congress reasonably concluded that a substantial number of works, which have serious value for adults, do not have serious value for minors.  Cf.

				<em>

				</em>
				, they do not necessarily have any such value for 
				<em>
					minors
				</em>
				&#x94;).  Thus, even though the serious value prong limits the total amount of speech covered by the statute, it remains true that there is a significant amount of protected speech within the category of materials that have no serious value for minors.  That speech is effectively prohibited whenever the least tolerant communities find it harmful to minors.

				  While the objective nature of the inquiry may eliminate any worry that the serious value determination will be made by the least tolerant community, it does not change the fact that, within the subset of images deemed to have no serious value for minors, the decision whether minors and adults throughout the country will have access to that speech will still be made by the most restrictive community.

According to his view, we cannot determine whether the statute is substantially overbroad based on its use of community standards without first determining how much of the speech on the Internet is saved by the other restrictions in the statute.  But this represents a fundamental misconception of our overbreadth doctrine.  As Justice White explained in

				</em>
				&#x94; (Emphasis added.)  Regardless of how the Court of Appeals interprets the &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; or &#x93;as a whole&#x94; provisions on remand, the question we must answer is whether the statute restricts a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its legitimate sweep by virtue of the fact that it uses community standards.

				  These other provisions may reduce the absolute number of Web pages covered by the statute, but even the narrowest version of the statute abridges a substantial amount of protected speech that many communities would not find harmful to minors.  Because Web speakers cannot limit access to those specific communities, the statute is substantially overbroad regardless of how its other provisions are construed.

				Even if most, if not all, of these works would be excluded from COPA&#x92;s coverage by the serious value prong, they illustrate the diversity of public opinion on the underlying themes depicted.  This diversity of views surely extends to whether materials with the same themes, that do not have serious value for minors, appeal to their prurient interests and are patently offensive.  There is no reason to think the differences between communities&#x92; standards will disappear once the image or description is no longer within the context of a work that has serious value for minors.

				  Because communities differ widely in their attitudes toward sex, particularly when minors are concerned, the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that, regardless of how COPA&#x92;s other provisions are construed, applying community standards to the Internet will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities.

				Whether that consequence is appropriate depends, of course, on the content of the message.  The kind of hard-core pornography involved in 
				<em>
					Hamling

Perhaps &#x93;teasers&#x94; that serve no function except to invite viewers to examine hardcore materials, or the hidden terms written into a Web site&#x92;s &#x93;metatags&#x94; in order to dupe unwitting Web surfers into visiting pornographic sites, deserve the same fate.  But COPA extends to a wide range of prurient appeals in advertisements, online magazines, Web-based bulletin boards and chat rooms, stock photo galleries, Web diaries, and a variety of illustrations encompassing a vast number of messages that are unobjectionable in most of the country and yet provide no &#x93;serious value&#x94; for minors.  It is quite wrong to allow the standards of a minority consisting of the least tolerant communities to regulate access to relatively harmless messages in this burgeoning market.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the context of most other media, using community standards to differentiate between permissible and impermissible speech has two virtues.  As mentioned above, community standards originally served as a shield to protect speakers from the least tolerant members of society.  By aggregating values at the community level, the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 test eliminated the outliers at both ends of the spectrum and provided some predictability as to what constitutes obscene speech.  But community standards also serve as a shield to protect audience members, by allowing people to self-sort based on their preferences.  Those who abhor and those who tolerate sexually explicit speech can seek out like-minded people and settle in communities that share their views on what is acceptable for themselves and their children.  This sorting mechanism, however, does not exist in cyberspace; the audience cannot self-segregate.  As a result, in the context of the Internet this shield also becomes a sword, because the community that wishes to live without certain material not only rids itself, but the entire Internet of the offending speech.

						 Petitioner cites examples of display statutes in 23 States that require magazine racks to shield minors from the covers of pornographic magazines.  Brief for Petitioner 22, 3a.  This Court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of any of these statutes, which are in any event of little relevance to regulation of speech on the Internet.  As we recognized in ACLU I, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/844" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 844</a>,

, &#x93; &#x91;the receipt of information on the Internet requires a series of affirmative steps more deliberate and directed than merely turning a dial&#x92; &#x94;&#x97;or scanning a magazine rack.

						 It is hardly a solution to say, as Justice Thomas suggests, ante, at 19, that a speaker need only choose a different medium in order to avoid having its speech judged by the least tolerant community.  Our overbreadth doctrine would quickly become a toothless protection if we were to hold that substituting a more limited forum for expression is an acceptable price to pay.  Since a content-based restriction is presumptively invalid, I would place the burden on parents to &#x93;take the simple step of utilizing a medium that enables,&#x94; ante, at 19, them to avoid this material before requiring the speaker to find another forum.

						 Justice Breyer seeks to avoid the problem by effectively reading the phrase &#x93;contemporary national standards&#x94; into the statute, ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  While the legislative history of COPA provides some support for this reading, it is contradicted by the clear text of the statute, which directs jurors to consider &#x93;community&#x94; standards.  This phrase is a term of art that has taken on a particular meaning in light of our precedent.  Although we have never held that applying a national standard would be constitutionally impermissible, we have said that asking a jury to do so is &#x93;an exercise in futility,&#x94; Miller v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">30</a> (1973)
, and that &#x93;[a] juror is entitled to draw on his own knowledge of the views of the average person in the community or vicinage from which he comes for making the required determination,&#x94; Hamling v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/418/87" class="subref" title="subref">418 U. S. 87</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a> (1974)
.  Any lingering doubts about the meaning of the phrase were certainly dispelled by our discussion of the issue in ACLU I, 521 U. S., at 874, n. 39, and we presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of our decisions.  Therefore, Justice Thomas has correctly refused to rewrite the statute to substitute a standard that Congress clearly did not choose.  And even if the Court were willing to do so, we would still have to acknowledge, as petitioner does, that jurors instructed to apply a national, or adult, standard, will reach widely different conclusions throughout the country, see ante, at 12; Brief for Petitioner 39.

						 Of course, Justice Thomas&#x92;s example of the image &#x93;of a war victim&#x92;s wounded nude body,&#x94; ante, at 15, n. 9, would not be covered by the statute unless it depicted &#x93;a lewd exhibition of the genitals or post-pubescent female breast&#x94; and lacked serious political value for minors,

						 The Court also notes that the limitation to communications made for commercial purposes narrows the category of speech as compared to the CDA, ante, at 5.  While it is certainly true that this condition limits the scope of the statute, the phrase &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; is somewhat misleading.  The definition of commercial purposes, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#e_2_B" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(e)(2)(B)</a>, covers anyone who generates revenue from advertisements or merchandise, regardless of the amount of advertising or whether the advertisements or products are related to the images that allegedly are harmful to minors.  As the District Court noted: &#x93;There is nothing in the text of the COPA, however, that limits its applicability to so-called commercial pornographers only; indeed, the text of COPA imposes liability on a speaker who knowingly makes any communication for commercial purposes &#x91;that includes any material that is harmful to minors,&#x92; &#x94; App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a.  In the context of the Internet, this is hardly a serious limitation.  A 1998 study, for example, found that 83 percent of Web sites contain commercial content.  Lawrence &amp; Giles, Accessibility of information of the web, 400 Nature 107&#x96;109 (1999); Guernsey, Seek&#x97;but on the Web, You Might Not Find, N. Y. Times, July 8, 1999, p. G3.  Interestingly, this same study found that only 1.5 percent of the 2.8 million sites cataloged contained pornographic content.

						 Justice Kennedy accuses the Court of Appeals of evaluating overbreadth in a vacuum by dismissing most of the concerns raised by the District Court, ante, at 8.  But most of those concerns went to whether COPA survives strict scrutiny, not overbreadth.  Even under Justice Kennedy&#x92;s formulation, it is unclear why it is relevant to an overbreadth analysis, for example, whether COPA could have been more narrowly tailored, whether the affirmative defenses impose too great a burden, or whether inclusion of criminal as well as civil penalties was excessive.

				Appeals to prurient interests are commonplace on the Internet, as in older media.  Many of those appeals lack serious value for minors as well as adults.  Some are offensive to certain viewers but welcomed by others.  For decades, our cases have recognized that the standards for judging their acceptability vary from viewer to viewer and from community to community.  Those cases developed the requirement that communications should be protected if they do not violate contemporary community standards.  In its original form, the community standard provided a shield for communications that are offensive only to the least tolerant members of society.  Thus, the Court &#x93;has emphasized on more than one occasion that a principal concern in requiring that a judgment be made on the basis of &#x92;contemporary community standards&#x92; is to assure that the material is judged neither on the basis of each juror&#x92;s personal opinion, nor by its effect on a particularly sensitive or insensitive person or group.&#x94;

.  In the context of the Internet, however, community standards become a sword, rather than a shield.  If a prurient appeal is offensive in a puritan village, it may be a crime to post it on the World Wide Web.

				COPA not only restricts speech that is made available to the general public, it also covers a medium in which speech cannot be segregated to avoid communities where it is likely to be considered harmful to minors.  The Internet presents a unique forum for communication because information, once posted, is accessible everywhere on the network at once.  The speaker cannot control access based on the location of the listener, nor can it choose the pathways through which its speech is transmitted.  By approving the use of community standards in this context,

				  While the objective nature of the inquiry may eliminate any worry that the serious value determination will be made by the least tolerant community, it does not change the fact that, within the subset of images deemed to have no serious value for minors, the decision whether minors and adults throughout the country will have access to that speech will still be made by the most restrictive community.

According to his view, we cannot determine whether the statute is substantially overbroad based on its use of community standards without first determining how much of the speech on the Internet is saved by the other restrictions in the statute.  But this represents a fundamental misconception of our overbreadth doctrine.  As Justice White explained in

				&#x94; (Emphasis added.)  Regardless of how the Court of Appeals interprets the &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; or &#x93;as a whole&#x94; provisions on remand, the question we must answer is whether the statute restricts a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its legitimate sweep by virtue of the fact that it uses community standards.

				  These other provisions may reduce the absolute number of Web pages covered by the statute, but even the narrowest version of the statute abridges a substantial amount of protected speech that many communities would not find harmful to minors.  Because Web speakers cannot limit access to those specific communities, the statute is substantially overbroad regardless of how its other provisions are construed.

				Even if most, if not all, of these works would be excluded from COPA&#x92;s coverage by the serious value prong, they illustrate the diversity of public opinion on the underlying themes depicted.  This diversity of views surely extends to whether materials with the same themes, that do not have serious value for minors, appeal to their prurient interests and are patently offensive.  There is no reason to think the differences between communities&#x92; standards will disappear once the image or description is no longer within the context of a work that has serious value for minors.

				  Because communities differ widely in their attitudes toward sex, particularly when minors are concerned, the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that, regardless of how COPA&#x92;s other provisions are construed, applying community standards to the Internet will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities.              
			</p>

				Whether that consequence is appropriate depends, of course, on the content of the message.  The kind of hard-core pornography involved in 
				<em>
					Hamling
				</em>
				, which I assume would be obscene under any community&#x92;s standard, does not belong on the Internet.  Perhaps &#x93;teasers&#x94; that serve no function except to invite viewers to examine hardcore materials, or the hidden terms written into a Web site&#x92;s &#x93;metatags&#x94; in order to dupe unwitting Web surfers into visiting pornographic sites, deserve the same fate.  But COPA extends to a wide range of prurient appeals in advertisements, online magazines, Web-based bulletin boards and chat rooms, stock photo galleries, Web diaries, and a variety of illustrations encompassing a vast number of messages that are unobjectionable in most of the country and yet provide no &#x93;serious value&#x94; for minors.  It is quite wrong to allow the standards of a minority consisting of the least tolerant communities to regulate access to relatively harmless messages in this burgeoning market.

				In the context of most other media, using community standards to differentiate between permissible and impermissible speech has two virtues.  As mentioned above, community standards originally served as a shield to protect speakers from the least tolerant members of society.  By aggregating values at the community level, the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 test eliminated the outliers at both ends of the spectrum and provided some predictability as to what constitutes obscene speech.  But community standards also serve as a shield to protect audience members, by allowing people to self-sort based on their preferences.  Those who abhor and those who tolerate sexually explicit speech can seek out like-minded people and settle in communities that share their views on what is acceptable for themselves and their children.  This sorting mechanism, however, does not exist in cyberspace; the audience cannot self-segregate.  As a result, in the context of the Internet this shield also becomes a sword, because the community that wishes to live without certain material not only rids itself, but the entire Internet of the offending speech.

						 Petitioner cites examples of display statutes in 23 States that require magazine racks to shield minors from the covers of pornographic magazines.  Brief for Petitioner 22, 3a.  This Court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of any of these statutes, which are in any event of little relevance to regulation of speech on the Internet.  As we recognized in ACLU I,

						 It is hardly a solution to say, as Justice Thomas suggests, ante, at 19, that a speaker need only choose a different medium in order to avoid having its speech judged by the least tolerant community.  Our overbreadth doctrine would quickly become a toothless protection if we were to hold that substituting a more limited forum for expression is an acceptable price to pay.  Since a content-based restriction is presumptively invalid, I would place the burden on parents to &#x93;take the simple step of utilizing a medium that enables,&#x94; ante, at 19, them to avoid this material before requiring the speaker to find another forum.

						 Justice Breyer seeks to avoid the problem by effectively reading the phrase &#x93;contemporary national standards&#x94; into the statute, ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  While the legislative history of COPA provides some support for this reading, it is contradicted by the clear text of the statute, which directs jurors to consider &#x93;community&#x94; standards.  This phrase is a term of art that has taken on a particular meaning in light of our precedent.  Although we have never held that applying a national standard would be constitutionally impermissible, we have said that asking a jury to do so is &#x93;an exercise in futility,&#x94; Miller v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">30</a> (1973)
, and that &#x93;[a] juror is entitled to draw on his own knowledge of the views of the average person in the community or vicinage from which he comes for making the required determination,&#x94; Hamling v. United States,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a> (1974)
.  Any lingering doubts about the meaning of the phrase were certainly dispelled by our discussion of the issue in ACLU I, 521 U. S., at 874, n. 39, and we presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of our decisions.  Therefore, Justice Thomas has correctly refused to rewrite the statute to substitute a standard that Congress clearly did not choose.  And even if the Court were willing to do so, we would still have to acknowledge, as petitioner does, that jurors instructed to apply a national, or adult, standard, will reach widely different conclusions throughout the country, see ante, at 12; Brief for Petitioner 39.

						 Of course, Justice Thomas&#x92;s example of the image &#x93;of a war victim&#x92;s wounded nude body,&#x94; ante, at 15, n. 9, would not be covered by the statute unless it depicted &#x93;a lewd exhibition of the genitals or post-pubescent female breast&#x94; and lacked serious political value for minors,

						 The Court also notes that the limitation to communications made for commercial purposes narrows the category of speech as compared to the CDA, ante, at 5.  While it is certainly true that this condition limits the scope of the statute, the phrase &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; is somewhat misleading.  The definition of commercial purposes, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#e_2_B" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(e)(2)(B)</a>, covers anyone who generates revenue from advertisements or merchandise, regardless of the amount of advertising or whether the advertisements or products are related to the images that allegedly are harmful to minors.  As the District Court noted: &#x93;There is nothing in the text of the COPA, however, that limits its applicability to so-called commercial pornographers only; indeed, the text of COPA imposes liability on a speaker who knowingly makes any communication for commercial purposes &#x91;that includes any material that is harmful to minors,&#x92; &#x94; App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a.  In the context of the Internet, this is hardly a serious limitation.  A 1998 study, for example, found that 83 percent of Web sites contain commercial content.  Lawrence &amp; Giles, Accessibility of information of the web, 400 Nature 107&#x96;109 (1999); Guernsey, Seek&#x97;but on the Web, You Might Not Find, N. Y. Times, July 8, 1999, p. G3.  Interestingly, this same study found that only 1.5 percent of the 2.8 million sites cataloged contained pornographic content.

						 Justice Kennedy accuses the Court of Appeals of evaluating overbreadth in a vacuum by dismissing most of the concerns raised by the District Court, ante, at 8.  But most of those concerns went to whether COPA survives strict scrutiny, not overbreadth.  Even under Justice Kennedy&#x92;s formulation, it is unclear why it is relevant to an overbreadth analysis, for example, whether COPA could have been more narrowly tailored, whether the affirmative defenses impose too great a burden, or whether inclusion of criminal as well as civil penalties was excessive.

				Appeals to prurient interests are commonplace on the Internet, as in older media.  Many of those appeals lack serious value for minors as well as adults.  Some are offensive to certain viewers but welcomed by others.  For decades, our cases have recognized that the standards for judging their acceptability vary from viewer to viewer and from community to community.  Those cases developed the requirement that communications should be protected if they do not violate contemporary community standards.  In its original form, the community standard provided a shield for communications that are offensive only to the least tolerant members of society.  Thus, the Court &#x93;has emphasized on more than one occasion that a principal concern in requiring that a judgment be made on the basis of &#x92;contemporary community standards&#x92; is to assure that the material is judged neither on the basis of each juror&#x92;s personal opinion, nor by its effect on a particularly sensitive or insensitive person or group.&#x94;

				COPA not only restricts speech that is made available to the general public, it also covers a medium in which speech cannot be segregated to avoid communities where it is likely to be considered harmful to minors.  The Internet presents a unique forum for communication because information, once posted, is accessible everywhere on the network at once.

				<em>

				</em>
				&#x94;).  Thus, even though the serious value prong limits the total amount of speech covered by the statute, it remains true that there is a significant amount of protected speech within the category of materials that have no serious value for minors.  That speech is effectively prohibited whenever the least tolerant communities find it harmful to minors.

				  While the objective nature of the inquiry may eliminate any worry that the serious value determination will be made by the least tolerant community, it does not change the fact that, within the subset of images deemed to have no serious value for minors, the decision whether minors and adults throughout the country will have access to that speech will still be made by the most restrictive community.

According to his view, we cannot determine whether the statute is substantially overbroad based on its use of community standards without first determining how much of the speech on the Internet is saved by the other restrictions in the statute.

				&#x94; (Emphasis added.)  Regardless of how the Court of Appeals interprets the &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; or &#x93;as a whole&#x94; provisions on remand, the question we must answer is whether the statute restricts a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its legitimate sweep by virtue of the fact that it uses community standards.

				  These other provisions may reduce the absolute number of Web pages covered by the statute, but even the narrowest version of the statute abridges a substantial amount of protected speech that many communities would not find harmful to minors.

				Even if most, if not all, of these works would be excluded from COPA&#x92;s coverage by the serious value prong, they illustrate the diversity of public opinion on the underlying themes depicted.  This diversity of views surely extends to whether materials with the same themes, that do not have serious value for minors, appeal to their prurient interests and are patently offensive.  There is no reason to think the differences between communities&#x92; standards will disappear once the image or description is no longer within the context of a work that has serious value for minors.

				  Because communities differ widely in their attitudes toward sex, particularly when minors are concerned, the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that, regardless of how COPA&#x92;s other provisions are construed, applying community standards to the Internet will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities.

				Whether that consequence is appropriate depends, of course, on the content of the message.  The kind of hard-core pornography involved in 
				<em>
					Hamling
				</em>
				, which I assume would be obscene under any community&#x92;s standard, does not belong on the Internet.  Perhaps &#x93;teasers&#x94; that serve no function except to invite viewers to examine hardcore materials, or the hidden terms written into a Web site&#x92;s &#x93;metatags&#x94; in order to dupe unwitting Web surfers into visiting pornographic sites, deserve the same fate.  But COPA extends to a wide range of prurient appeals in advertisements, online magazines, Web-based bulletin boards and chat rooms, stock photo galleries, Web diaries, and a variety of illustrations encompassing a vast number of messages that are unobjectionable in most of the country and yet provide no &#x93;serious value&#x94; for minors.  It is quite wrong to allow the standards of a minority consisting of the least tolerant communities to regulate access to relatively harmless messages in this burgeoning market.

				In the context of most other media, using community standards to differentiate between permissible and impermissible speech has two virtues.  As mentioned above, community standards originally served as a shield to protect speakers from the least tolerant members of society.  By aggregating values at the community level, the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 test eliminated the outliers at both ends of the spectrum and provided some predictability as to what constitutes obscene speech.  But community standards also serve as a shield to protect audience members, by allowing people to self-sort based on their preferences.  Those who abhor and those who tolerate sexually explicit speech can seek out like-minded people and settle in communities that share their views on what is acceptable for themselves and their children.  This sorting mechanism, however, does not exist in cyberspace; the audience cannot self-segregate.  As a result, in the context of the Internet this shield also becomes a sword, because the community that wishes to live without certain material not only rids itself, but the entire Internet of the offending speech.

						 Petitioner cites examples of display statutes in 23 States that require magazine racks to shield minors from the covers of pornographic magazines.  Brief for Petitioner 22, 3a.

						 It is hardly a solution to say, as Justice Thomas suggests, ante, at 19, that a speaker need only choose a different medium in order to avoid having its speech judged by the least tolerant community.  Our overbreadth doctrine would quickly become a toothless protection if we were to hold that substituting a more limited forum for expression is an acceptable price to pay.  Since a content-based restriction is presumptively invalid, I would place the burden on parents to &#x93;take the simple step of utilizing a medium that enables,&#x94; ante, at 19, them to avoid this material before requiring the speaker to find another forum.

						 Justice Breyer seeks to avoid the problem by effectively reading the phrase &#x93;contemporary national standards&#x94; into the statute, ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  While the legislative history of COPA provides some support for this reading, it is contradicted by the clear text of the statute, which directs jurors to consider &#x93;community&#x94; standards.  This phrase is a term of art that has taken on a particular meaning in light of our precedent.  Although we have never held that applying a national standard would be constitutionally impermissible, we have said that asking a jury to do so is &#x93;an exercise in futility,&#x94; Miller v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">30</a> (1973)

.  Any lingering doubts about the meaning of the phrase were certainly dispelled by our discussion of the issue in ACLU I, 521 U. S., at 874, n. 39, and we presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of our decisions.  Therefore, Justice Thomas has correctly refused to rewrite the statute to substitute a standard that Congress clearly did not choose.  And even if the Court were willing to do so, we would still have to acknowledge, as petitioner does, that jurors instructed to apply a national, or adult, standard, will reach widely different conclusions throughout the country, see ante, at 12; Brief for Petitioner 39.

						 The Court also notes that the limitation to communications made for commercial purposes narrows the category of speech as compared to the CDA, ante, at 5.  While it is certainly true that this condition limits the scope of the statute, the phrase &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; is somewhat misleading.  The definition of commercial purposes,

C. &#xA7;231(e)(2)(B)</a>, covers anyone who generates revenue from advertisements or merchandise, regardless of the amount of advertising or whether the advertisements or products are related to the images that allegedly are harmful to minors.  As the District Court noted: &#x93;There is nothing in the text of the COPA, however, that limits its applicability to so-called commercial pornographers only; indeed, the text of COPA imposes liability on a speaker who knowingly makes any communication for commercial purposes &#x91;that includes any material that is harmful to minors,&#x92; &#x94; App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a.  In the context of the Internet, this is hardly a serious limitation.  A 1998 study, for example, found that 83 percent of Web sites contain commercial content.  Lawrence &amp; Giles, Accessibility of information of the web, 400 Nature 107&#x96;109 (1999); Guernsey, Seek&#x97;but on the Web, You Might Not Find, N. Y. Times, July 8, 1999, p. G3.  Interestingly, this same study found that only 1.5 percent of the 2.8 million sites cataloged contained pornographic content.

						 Justice Kennedy accuses the Court of Appeals of evaluating overbreadth in a vacuum by dismissing most of the concerns raised by the District Court, ante, at 8.  But most of those concerns went to whether COPA survives strict scrutiny, not overbreadth.  Even under Justice Kennedy&#x92;s formulation, it is unclear why it is relevant to an overbreadth analysis, for example, whether COPA could have been more narrowly tailored, whether the affirmative defenses impose too great a burden, or whether inclusion of criminal as well as civil penalties was excessive.

				Appeals to prurient interests are commonplace on the Internet, as in older media.  Many of those appeals lack serious value for minors as well as adults.  Some are offensive to certain viewers but welcomed by others.  For decades, our cases have recognized that the standards for judging their acceptability vary from viewer to viewer and from community to community.  Those cases developed the requirement that communications should be protected if they do not violate contemporary community standards.  In its original form, the community standard provided a shield for communications that are offensive only to the least tolerant members of society.  Thus, the Court &#x93;has emphasized on more than one occasion that a principal concern in requiring that a judgment be made on the basis of &#x92;contemporary community standards&#x92; is to assure that the material is judged neither on the basis of each juror&#x92;s personal opinion, nor by its effect on a particularly sensitive or insensitive person or group.&#x94;

				COPA not only restricts speech that is made available to the general public, it also covers a medium in which speech cannot be segregated to avoid communities where it is likely to be considered harmful to minors.  The Internet presents a unique forum for communication because information, once posted, is accessible everywhere on the network at once.  The speaker cannot control access based on the location of the listener, nor can it choose the pathways through which its speech is transmitted.

Whatever disparity exists between various communities&#x92; assessment of the content that appeals to the prurient interest of minors will surely be matched by their differing opinions as to whether descriptions of sexual acts or depictions of nudity are patently offensive with respect to minors.

				Petitioner&#x92;s argument that the &#x93;serious value&#x94; prong minimizes the statute&#x92;s overbreadth is also unpersuasive.  Although we have recognized that the serious value determination in obscenity cases should be based on an objective, reasonable person standard,

				<em>

				</em>
				.  Congress reasonably concluded that a substantial number of works, which have serious value for adults, do not have serious value for minors.  Cf.

				<em>
					adults
				</em>
				, they do not necessarily have any such value for 
				<em>
					minors
				</em>
				&#x94;).  Thus, even though the serious value prong limits the total amount of speech covered by the statute, it remains true that there is a significant amount of protected speech within the category of materials that have no serious value for minors.  That speech is effectively prohibited whenever the least tolerant communities find it harmful to minors.

				  While the objective nature of the inquiry may eliminate any worry that the serious value determination will be made by the least tolerant community, it does not change the fact that, within the subset of images deemed to have no serious value for minors, the decision whether minors and adults throughout the country will have access to that speech will still be made by the most restrictive community.

According to his view, we cannot determine whether the statute is substantially overbroad based on its use of community standards without first determining how much of the speech on the Internet is saved by the other restrictions in the statute.  But this represents a fundamental misconception of our overbreadth doctrine.  As Justice White explained in

				<em>

				</em>
				&#x94; (Emphasis added.)  Regardless of how the Court of Appeals interprets the &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; or &#x93;as a whole&#x94; provisions on remand, the question we must answer is whether the statute restricts a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its legitimate sweep by virtue of the fact that it uses community standards.

				  These other provisions may reduce the absolute number of Web pages covered by the statute, but even the narrowest version of the statute abridges a substantial amount of protected speech that many communities would not find harmful to minors.  Because Web speakers cannot limit access to those specific communities, the statute is substantially overbroad regardless of how its other provisions are construed.

				Even if most, if not all, of these works would be excluded from COPA&#x92;s coverage by the serious value prong, they illustrate the diversity of public opinion on the underlying themes depicted.  This diversity of views surely extends to whether materials with the same themes, that do not have serious value for minors, appeal to their prurient interests and are patently offensive.  There is no reason to think the differences between communities&#x92; standards will disappear once the image or description is no longer within the context of a work that has serious value for minors.

				  Because communities differ widely in their attitudes toward sex, particularly when minors are concerned, the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that, regardless of how COPA&#x92;s other provisions are construed, applying community standards to the Internet will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities.

				Whether that consequence is appropriate depends, of course, on the content of the message.  The kind of hard-core pornography involved in 
				<em>
					Hamling
				</em>
				, which I assume would be obscene under any community&#x92;s standard, does not belong on the Internet.  Perhaps &#x93;teasers&#x94; that serve no function except to invite viewers to examine hardcore materials, or the hidden terms written into a Web site&#x92;s &#x93;metatags&#x94; in order to dupe unwitting Web surfers into visiting pornographic sites, deserve the same fate.  But COPA extends to a wide range of prurient appeals in advertisements, online magazines, Web-based bulletin boards and chat rooms, stock photo galleries, Web diaries, and a variety of illustrations encompassing a vast number of messages that are unobjectionable in most of the country and yet provide no &#x93;serious value&#x94; for minors.  It is quite wrong to allow the standards of a minority consisting of the least tolerant communities to regulate access to relatively harmless messages in this burgeoning market.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the context of most other media, using community standards to differentiate between permissible and impermissible speech has two virtues.  As mentioned above, community standards originally served as a shield to protect speakers from the least tolerant members of society.  By aggregating values at the community level, the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 test eliminated the outliers at both ends of the spectrum and provided some predictability as to what constitutes obscene speech.  But community standards also serve as a shield to protect audience members, by allowing people to self-sort based on their preferences.  Those who abhor and those who tolerate sexually explicit speech can seek out like-minded people and settle in communities that share their views on what is acceptable for themselves and their children.  This sorting mechanism, however, does not exist in cyberspace; the audience cannot self-segregate.  As a result, in the context of the Internet this shield also becomes a sword, because the community that wishes to live without certain material not only rids itself, but the entire Internet of the offending speech.

S., at 874, n. 39, and we presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of our decisions.  Therefore, Justice Thomas has correctly refused to rewrite the statute to substitute a standard that Congress clearly did not choose.  And even if the Court were willing to do so, we would still have to acknowledge, as petitioner does, that jurors instructed to apply a national, or adult, standard, will reach widely different conclusions throughout the country, see ante, at 12; Brief for Petitioner 39.

						 Of course, Justice Thomas&#x92;s example of the image &#x93;of a war victim&#x92;s wounded nude body,&#x94; ante, at 15, n. 9, would not be covered by the statute unless it depicted &#x93;a lewd exhibition of the genitals or post-pubescent female breast&#x94; and lacked serious political value for minors,

						 The Court also notes that the limitation to communications made for commercial purposes narrows the category of speech as compared to the CDA, ante, at 5.  While it is certainly true that this condition limits the scope of the statute, the phrase &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; is somewhat misleading.  The definition of commercial purposes, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#e_2_B" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(e)(2)(B)</a>, covers anyone who generates revenue from advertisements or merchandise, regardless of the amount of advertising or whether the advertisements or products are related to the images that allegedly are harmful to minors.  As the District Court noted: &#x93;There is nothing in the text of the COPA, however, that limits its applicability to so-called commercial pornographers only; indeed, the text of COPA imposes liability on a speaker who knowingly makes any communication for commercial purposes &#x91;that includes any material that is harmful to minors,&#x92; &#x94; App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a.  In the context of the Internet, this is hardly a serious limitation.  A 1998 study, for example, found that 83 percent of Web sites contain commercial content.

Interestingly, this same study found that only 1.5 percent of the 2.8 million sites cataloged contained pornographic content.

						 Justice Kennedy accuses the Court of Appeals of evaluating overbreadth in a vacuum by dismissing most of the concerns raised by the District Court, ante, at 8.  But most of those concerns went to whether COPA survives strict scrutiny, not overbreadth.  Even under Justice Kennedy&#x92;s formulation, it is unclear why it is relevant to an overbreadth analysis, for example, whether COPA could have been more narrowly tailored, whether the affirmative defenses impose too great a burden, or whether inclusion of criminal as well as civil penalties was excessive.

				Appeals to prurient interests are commonplace on the Internet, as in older media.  Many of those appeals lack serious value for minors as well as adults.  Some are offensive to certain viewers but welcomed by others.  For decades, our cases have recognized that the standards for judging their acceptability vary from viewer to viewer and from community to community.  Those cases developed the requirement that communications should be protected if they do not violate contemporary community standards.  In its original form, the community standard provided a shield for communications that are offensive only to the least tolerant members of society.  Thus, the Court &#x93;has emphasized on more than one occasion that a principal concern in requiring that a judgment be made on the basis of &#x92;contemporary community standards&#x92; is to assure that the material is judged neither on the basis of each juror&#x92;s personal opinion, nor by its effect on a particularly sensitive or insensitive person or group.&#x94;

				COPA not only restricts speech that is made available to the general public, it also covers a medium in which speech cannot be segregated to avoid communities where it is likely to be considered harmful to minors.  The Internet presents a unique forum for communication because information, once posted, is accessible everywhere on the network at once.  The speaker cannot control access based on the location of the listener, nor can it choose the pathways through which its speech is transmitted.  By approving the use of community standards in this context,

				Petitioner&#x92;s argument that the &#x93;serious value&#x94; prong minimizes the statute&#x92;s overbreadth is also unpersuasive.  Although we have recognized that the serious value determination in obscenity cases should be based on an objective, reasonable person standard,

				, they do not necessarily have any such value for 
				<em>

				</em>
				&#x94;).  Thus, even though the serious value prong limits the total amount of speech covered by the statute, it remains true that there is a significant amount of protected speech within the category of materials that have no serious value for minors.  That speech is effectively prohibited whenever the least tolerant communities find it harmful to minors.

				  While the objective nature of the inquiry may eliminate any worry that the serious value determination will be made by the least tolerant community, it does not change the fact that, within the subset of images deemed to have no serious value for minors, the decision whether minors and adults throughout the country will have access to that speech will still be made by the most restrictive community.

According to his view, we cannot determine whether the statute is substantially overbroad based on its use of community standards without first determining how much of the speech on the Internet is saved by the other restrictions in the statute.

				&#x94; (Emphasis added.)  Regardless of how the Court of Appeals interprets the &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; or &#x93;as a whole&#x94; provisions on remand, the question we must answer is whether the statute restricts a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its legitimate sweep by virtue of the fact that it uses community standards.

				  These other provisions may reduce the absolute number of Web pages covered by the statute, but even the narrowest version of the statute abridges a substantial amount of protected speech that many communities would not find harmful to minors.

				Even if most, if not all, of these works would be excluded from COPA&#x92;s coverage by the serious value prong, they illustrate the diversity of public opinion on the underlying themes depicted.  This diversity of views surely extends to whether materials with the same themes, that do not have serious value for minors, appeal to their prurient interests and are patently offensive.  There is no reason to think the differences between communities&#x92; standards will disappear once the image or description is no longer within the context of a work that has serious value for minors.

				  Because communities differ widely in their attitudes toward sex, particularly when minors are concerned, the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that, regardless of how COPA&#x92;s other provisions are construed, applying community standards to the Internet will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities.              
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether that consequence is appropriate depends, of course, on the content of the message.  The kind of hard-core pornography involved in 
				<em>
					Hamling
				</em>
				, which I assume would be obscene under any community&#x92;s standard, does not belong on the Internet.  Perhaps &#x93;teasers&#x94; that serve no function except to invite viewers to examine hardcore materials, or the hidden terms written into a Web site&#x92;s &#x93;metatags&#x94; in order to dupe unwitting Web surfers into visiting pornographic sites, deserve the same fate.  But COPA extends to a wide range of prurient appeals in advertisements, online magazines, Web-based bulletin boards and chat rooms, stock photo galleries, Web diaries, and a variety of illustrations encompassing a vast number of messages that are unobjectionable in most of the country and yet provide no &#x93;serious value&#x94; for minors.  It is quite wrong to allow the standards of a minority consisting of the least tolerant communities to regulate access to relatively harmless messages in this burgeoning market.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the context of most other media, using community standards to differentiate between permissible and impermissible speech has two virtues.  As mentioned above, community standards originally served as a shield to protect speakers from the least tolerant members of society.  By aggregating values at the community level, the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 test eliminated the outliers at both ends of the spectrum and provided some predictability as to what constitutes obscene speech.  But community standards also serve as a shield to protect audience members, by allowing people to self-sort based on their preferences.  Those who abhor and those who tolerate sexually explicit speech can seek out like-minded people and settle in communities that share their views on what is acceptable for themselves and their children.  This sorting mechanism, however, does not exist in cyberspace; the audience cannot self-segregate.  As a result, in the context of the Internet this shield also becomes a sword, because the community that wishes to live without certain material not only rids itself, but the entire Internet of the offending speech.

						 Petitioner cites examples of display statutes in 23 States that require magazine racks to shield minors from the covers of pornographic magazines.  Brief for Petitioner 22, 3a.  This Court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of any of these statutes, which are in any event of little relevance to regulation of speech on the Internet.  As we recognized in ACLU I, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/844" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 844</a>,

						 It is hardly a solution to say, as Justice Thomas suggests, ante, at 19, that a speaker need only choose a different medium in order to avoid having its speech judged by the least tolerant community.  Our overbreadth doctrine would quickly become a toothless protection if we were to hold that substituting a more limited forum for expression is an acceptable price to pay.  Since a content-based restriction is presumptively invalid, I would place the burden on parents to &#x93;take the simple step of utilizing a medium that enables,&#x94; ante, at 19, them to avoid this material before requiring the speaker to find another forum.

						 Justice Breyer seeks to avoid the problem by effectively reading the phrase &#x93;contemporary national standards&#x94; into the statute, ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  While the legislative history of COPA provides some support for this reading, it is contradicted by the clear text of the statute, which directs jurors to consider &#x93;community&#x94; standards.  This phrase is a term of art that has taken on a particular meaning in light of our precedent.  Although we have never held that applying a national standard would be constitutionally impermissible, we have said that asking a jury to do so is &#x93;an exercise in futility,&#x94; Miller v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">30</a> (1973)
, and that &#x93;[a] juror is entitled to draw on his own knowledge of the views of the average person in the community or vicinage from which he comes for making the required determination,&#x94; Hamling v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/418/87" class="subref" title="subref">418 U. S. 87</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a> (1974)
.  Any lingering doubts about the meaning of the phrase were certainly dispelled by our discussion of the issue in ACLU I, 521 U. S., at 874, n. 39, and we presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of our decisions.  Therefore, Justice Thomas has correctly refused to rewrite the statute to substitute a standard that Congress clearly did not choose.  And even if the Court were willing to do so, we would still have to acknowledge, as petitioner does, that jurors instructed to apply a national, or adult, standard, will reach widely different conclusions throughout the country, see ante, at 12; Brief for Petitioner 39.

						 Of course, Justice Thomas&#x92;s example of the image &#x93;of a war victim&#x92;s wounded nude body,&#x94; ante, at 15, n. 9, would not be covered by the statute unless it depicted &#x93;a lewd exhibition of the genitals or post-pubescent female breast&#x94; and lacked serious political value for minors,

						 The Court also notes that the limitation to communications made for commercial purposes narrows the category of speech as compared to the CDA, ante, at 5.  While it is certainly true that this condition limits the scope of the statute, the phrase &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; is somewhat misleading.  The definition of commercial purposes, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#e_2_B" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(e)(2)(B)</a>, covers anyone who generates revenue from advertisements or merchandise, regardless of the amount of advertising or whether the advertisements or products are related to the images that allegedly are harmful to minors.  As the District Court noted: &#x93;There is nothing in the text of the COPA, however, that limits its applicability to so-called commercial pornographers only; indeed, the text of COPA imposes liability on a speaker who knowingly makes any communication for commercial purposes &#x91;that includes any material that is harmful to minors,&#x92; &#x94; App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a.  In the context of the Internet, this is hardly a serious limitation.  A 1998 study, for example, found that 83 percent of Web sites contain commercial content.  Lawrence &amp; Giles, Accessibility of information of the web, 400 Nature 107&#x96;109 (1999); Guernsey, Seek&#x97;but on the Web, You Might Not Find, N. Y. Times, July 8, 1999, p. G3.  Interestingly, this same study found that only 1.5 percent of the 2.8 million sites cataloged contained pornographic content.

						 Justice Kennedy accuses the Court of Appeals of evaluating overbreadth in a vacuum by dismissing most of the concerns raised by the District Court, ante, at 8.  But most of those concerns went to whether COPA survives strict scrutiny, not overbreadth.  Even under Justice Kennedy&#x92;s formulation, it is unclear why it is relevant to an overbreadth analysis, for example, whether COPA could have been more narrowly tailored, whether the affirmative defenses impose too great a burden, or whether inclusion of criminal as well as civil penalties was excessive.

				Appeals to prurient interests are commonplace on the Internet, as in older media.  Many of those appeals lack serious value for minors as well as adults.  Some are offensive to certain viewers but welcomed by others.  For decades, our cases have recognized that the standards for judging their acceptability vary from viewer to viewer and from community to community.  Those cases developed the requirement that communications should be protected if they do not violate contemporary community standards.  In its original form, the community standard provided a shield for communications that are offensive only to the least tolerant members of society.  Thus, the Court &#x93;has emphasized on more than one occasion that a principal concern in requiring that a judgment be made on the basis of &#x92;contemporary community standards&#x92; is to assure that the material is judged neither on the basis of each juror&#x92;s personal opinion, nor by its effect on a particularly sensitive or insensitive person or group.&#x94;

				COPA not only restricts speech that is made available to the general public, it also covers a medium in which speech cannot be segregated to avoid communities where it is likely to be considered harmful to minors.  The Internet presents a unique forum for communication because information, once posted, is accessible everywhere on the network at once.  The speaker cannot control access based on the location of the listener, nor can it choose the pathways through which its speech is transmitted.  By approving the use of community standards in this context,

Whatever disparity exists between various communities&#x92; assessment of the content that appeals to the prurient interest of minors will surely be matched by their differing opinions as to whether descriptions of sexual acts or depictions of nudity are patently offensive with respect to minors.

				Petitioner&#x92;s argument that the &#x93;serious value&#x94; prong minimizes the statute&#x92;s overbreadth is also unpersuasive.  Although we have recognized that the serious value determination in obscenity cases should be based on an objective, reasonable person standard,

				</em>
				.  Congress reasonably concluded that a substantial number of works, which have serious value for adults, do not have serious value for minors.  Cf.

				<em>

				</em>
				, they do not necessarily have any such value for 
				<em>

				</em>
				&#x94;).  Thus, even though the serious value prong limits the total amount of speech covered by the statute, it remains true that there is a significant amount of protected speech within the category of materials that have no serious value for minors.  That speech is effectively prohibited whenever the least tolerant communities find it harmful to minors.

				  While the objective nature of the inquiry may eliminate any worry that the serious value determination will be made by the least tolerant community, it does not change the fact that, within the subset of images deemed to have no serious value for minors, the decision whether minors and adults throughout the country will have access to that speech will still be made by the most restrictive community.

				, at 2 (opinion concurring in judgment), when he ties the overbreadth inquiry to questions about the scope of the other provisions of the statute.  According to his view, we cannot determine whether the statute is substantially overbroad based on its use of community standards without first determining how much of the speech on the Internet is saved by the other restrictions in the statute.  But this represents a fundamental misconception of our overbreadth doctrine.  As Justice White explained in

				<em>

				</em>
				&#x94; (Emphasis added.)  Regardless of how the Court of Appeals interprets the &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; or &#x93;as a whole&#x94; provisions on remand, the question we must answer is whether the statute restricts a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its legitimate sweep by virtue of the fact that it uses community standards.

				  These other provisions may reduce the absolute number of Web pages covered by the statute, but even the narrowest version of the statute abridges a substantial amount of protected speech that many communities would not find harmful to minors.  Because Web speakers cannot limit access to those specific communities, the statute is substantially overbroad regardless of how its other provisions are construed.

				Even if most, if not all, of these works would be excluded from COPA&#x92;s coverage by the serious value prong, they illustrate the diversity of public opinion on the underlying themes depicted.  This diversity of views surely extends to whether materials with the same themes, that do not have serious value for minors, appeal to their prurient interests and are patently offensive.  There is no reason to think the differences between communities&#x92; standards will disappear once the image or description is no longer within the context of a work that has serious value for minors.

				  Because communities differ widely in their attitudes toward sex, particularly when minors are concerned, the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that, regardless of how COPA&#x92;s other provisions are construed, applying community standards to the Internet will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities.              
			</p>

				Whether that consequence is appropriate depends, of course, on the content of the message.  The kind of hard-core pornography involved in 
				<em>
					Hamling
				</em>
				, which I assume would be obscene under any community&#x92;s standard, does not belong on the Internet.  Perhaps &#x93;teasers&#x94; that serve no function except to invite viewers to examine hardcore materials, or the hidden terms written into a Web site&#x92;s &#x93;metatags&#x94; in order to dupe unwitting Web surfers into visiting pornographic sites, deserve the same fate.  But COPA extends to a wide range of prurient appeals in advertisements, online magazines, Web-based bulletin boards and chat rooms, stock photo galleries, Web diaries, and a variety of illustrations encompassing a vast number of messages that are unobjectionable in most of the country and yet provide no &#x93;serious value&#x94; for minors.  It is quite wrong to allow the standards of a minority consisting of the least tolerant communities to regulate access to relatively harmless messages in this burgeoning market.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the context of most other media, using community standards to differentiate between permissible and impermissible speech has two virtues.  As mentioned above, community standards originally served as a shield to protect speakers from the least tolerant members of society.  By aggregating values at the community level, the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 test eliminated the outliers at both ends of the spectrum and provided some predictability as to what constitutes obscene speech.  But community standards also serve as a shield to protect audience members, by allowing people to self-sort based on their preferences.  Those who abhor and those who tolerate sexually explicit speech can seek out like-minded people and settle in communities that share their views on what is acceptable for themselves and their children.  This sorting mechanism, however, does not exist in cyberspace; the audience cannot self-segregate.  As a result, in the context of the Internet this shield also becomes a sword, because the community that wishes to live without certain material not only rids itself, but the entire Internet of the offending speech.

						 Petitioner cites examples of display statutes in 23 States that require magazine racks to shield minors from the covers of pornographic magazines.  Brief for Petitioner 22, 3a.  This Court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of any of these statutes, which are in any event of little relevance to regulation of speech on the Internet.  As we recognized in ACLU I,

						 It is hardly a solution to say, as Justice Thomas suggests, ante, at 19, that a speaker need only choose a different medium in order to avoid having its speech judged by the least tolerant community.  Our overbreadth doctrine would quickly become a toothless protection if we were to hold that substituting a more limited forum for expression is an acceptable price to pay.  Since a content-based restriction is presumptively invalid, I would place the burden on parents to &#x93;take the simple step of utilizing a medium that enables,&#x94; ante, at 19, them to avoid this material before requiring the speaker to find another forum.

						 Justice Breyer seeks to avoid the problem by effectively reading the phrase &#x93;contemporary national standards&#x94; into the statute, ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  While the legislative history of COPA provides some support for this reading, it is contradicted by the clear text of the statute, which directs jurors to consider &#x93;community&#x94; standards.  This phrase is a term of art that has taken on a particular meaning in light of our precedent.  Although we have never held that applying a national standard would be constitutionally impermissible, we have said that asking a jury to do so is &#x93;an exercise in futility,&#x94; Miller v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">30</a> (1973)

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a> (1974)
.  Any lingering doubts about the meaning of the phrase were certainly dispelled by our discussion of the issue in ACLU I, 521 U. S., at 874, n. 39, and we presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of our decisions.  Therefore, Justice Thomas has correctly refused to rewrite the statute to substitute a standard that Congress clearly did not choose.  And even if the Court were willing to do so, we would still have to acknowledge, as petitioner does, that jurors instructed to apply a national, or adult, standard, will reach widely different conclusions throughout the country, see ante, at 12; Brief for Petitioner 39.

						 The Court also notes that the limitation to communications made for commercial purposes narrows the category of speech as compared to the CDA, ante, at 5.  While it is certainly true that this condition limits the scope of the statute, the phrase &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; is somewhat misleading.  The definition of commercial purposes, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#e_2_B" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(e)(2)(B)</a>, covers anyone who generates revenue from advertisements or merchandise, regardless of the amount of advertising or whether the advertisements or products are related to the images that allegedly are harmful to minors.  As the District Court noted: &#x93;There is nothing in the text of the COPA, however, that limits its applicability to so-called commercial pornographers only; indeed, the text of COPA imposes liability on a speaker who knowingly makes any communication for commercial purposes &#x91;that includes any material that is harmful to minors,&#x92; &#x94; App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a.  In the context of the Internet, this is hardly a serious limitation.  A 1998 study, for example, found that 83 percent of Web sites contain commercial content.  Lawrence &amp; Giles, Accessibility of information of the web, 400 Nature 107&#x96;109 (1999); Guernsey, Seek&#x97;but on the Web, You Might Not Find, N. Y. Times, July 8, 1999, p. G3.  Interestingly, this same study found that only 1.5 percent of the 2.8 million sites cataloged contained pornographic content.

						 Justice Kennedy accuses the Court of Appeals of evaluating overbreadth in a vacuum by dismissing most of the concerns raised by the District Court, ante, at 8.  But most of those concerns went to whether COPA survives strict scrutiny, not overbreadth.  Even under Justice Kennedy&#x92;s formulation, it is unclear why it is relevant to an overbreadth analysis, for example, whether COPA could have been more narrowly tailored, whether the affirmative defenses impose too great a burden, or whether inclusion of criminal as well as civil penalties was excessive.

				Appeals to prurient interests are commonplace on the Internet, as in older media.  Many of those appeals lack serious value for minors as well as adults.  Some are offensive to certain viewers but welcomed by others.  For decades, our cases have recognized that the standards for judging their acceptability vary from viewer to viewer and from community to community.  Those cases developed the requirement that communications should be protected if they do not violate contemporary community standards.  In its original form, the community standard provided a shield for communications that are offensive only to the least tolerant members of society.  Thus, the Court &#x93;has emphasized on more than one occasion that a principal concern in requiring that a judgment be made on the basis of &#x92;contemporary community standards&#x92; is to assure that the material is judged neither on the basis of each juror&#x92;s personal opinion, nor by its effect on a particularly sensitive or insensitive person or group.&#x94;

				COPA not only restricts speech that is made available to the general public, it also covers a medium in which speech cannot be segregated to avoid communities where it is likely to be considered harmful to minors.  The Internet presents a unique forum for communication because information, once posted, is accessible everywhere on the network at once.  The speaker cannot control access based on the location of the listener, nor can it choose the pathways through which its speech is transmitted.  By approving the use of community standards in this context,

It is true that, in addition to COPA&#x92;s &#x93;appeals to the prurient interest of minors&#x94; prong, the material must be &#x93;patently offensive with respect to minors&#x94; and it must lack &#x93;serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.&#x94;

Whatever disparity exists between various communities&#x92; assessment of the content that appeals to the prurient interest of minors will surely be matched by their differing opinions as to whether descriptions of sexual acts or depictions of nudity are patently offensive with respect to minors.

				Petitioner&#x92;s argument that the &#x93;serious value&#x94; prong minimizes the statute&#x92;s overbreadth is also unpersuasive.  Although we have recognized that the serious value determination in obscenity cases should be based on an objective, reasonable person standard,

, formulation of the serious value prong.  The question for the jury is not whether a reasonable person would conclude that the materials have serious value; instead, the jury must determine whether the materials have serious value 
				<em>
					for minors
				</em>
				.  Congress reasonably concluded that a substantial number of works, which have serious value for adults, do not have serious value for minors.  Cf.

				<span class="smallcaps">

				<em>
					adults
				</em>
				, they do not necessarily have any such value for 
				<em>
					minors
				</em>
				&#x94;).  Thus, even though the serious value prong limits the total amount of speech covered by the statute, it remains true that there is a significant amount of protected speech within the category of materials that have no serious value for minors.  That speech is effectively prohibited whenever the least tolerant communities find it harmful to minors.

				  While the objective nature of the inquiry may eliminate any worry that the serious value determination will be made by the least tolerant community, it does not change the fact that, within the subset of images deemed to have no serious value for minors, the decision whether minors and adults throughout the country will have access to that speech will still be made by the most restrictive community.

				 makes a similar misstep, 
				<em>

				, at 2 (opinion concurring in judgment), when he ties the overbreadth inquiry to questions about the scope of the other provisions of the statute.  According to his view, we cannot determine whether the statute is substantially overbroad based on its use of community standards without first determining how much of the speech on the Internet is saved by the other restrictions in the statute.  But this represents a fundamental misconception of our overbreadth doctrine.  As Justice White explained in

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">615</a> (1973)
, &#x93;the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, 
				<em>
					judged in relation to the statute&#x92;s plainly legitimate sweep.
				</em>
				&#x94; (Emphasis added.)  Regardless of how the Court of Appeals interprets the &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; or &#x93;as a whole&#x94; provisions on remand, the question we must answer is whether the statute restricts a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its legitimate sweep by virtue of the fact that it uses community standards.

				  These other provisions may reduce the absolute number of Web pages covered by the statute, but even the narrowest version of the statute abridges a substantial amount of protected speech that many communities would not find harmful to minors.  Because Web speakers cannot limit access to those specific communities, the statute is substantially overbroad regardless of how its other provisions are construed.

				Even if most, if not all, of these works would be excluded from COPA&#x92;s coverage by the serious value prong, they illustrate the diversity of public opinion on the underlying themes depicted.  This diversity of views surely extends to whether materials with the same themes, that do not have serious value for minors, appeal to their prurient interests and are patently offensive.  There is no reason to think the differences between communities&#x92; standards will disappear once the image or description is no longer within the context of a work that has serious value for minors.

				  Because communities differ widely in their attitudes toward sex, particularly when minors are concerned, the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that, regardless of how COPA&#x92;s other provisions are construed, applying community standards to the Internet will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities.              
			</p>

				Whether that consequence is appropriate depends, of course, on the content of the message.  The kind of hard-core pornography involved in 
				<em>
					Hamling
				</em>
				, which I assume would be obscene under any community&#x92;s standard, does not belong on the Internet.  Perhaps &#x93;teasers&#x94; that serve no function except to invite viewers to examine hardcore materials, or the hidden terms written into a Web site&#x92;s &#x93;metatags&#x94; in order to dupe unwitting Web surfers into visiting pornographic sites, deserve the same fate.  But COPA extends to a wide range of prurient appeals in advertisements, online magazines, Web-based bulletin boards and chat rooms, stock photo galleries, Web diaries, and a variety of illustrations encompassing a vast number of messages that are unobjectionable in most of the country and yet provide no &#x93;serious value&#x94; for minors.  It is quite wrong to allow the standards of a minority consisting of the least tolerant communities to regulate access to relatively harmless messages in this burgeoning market.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the context of most other media, using community standards to differentiate between permissible and impermissible speech has two virtues.  As mentioned above, community standards originally served as a shield to protect speakers from the least tolerant members of society.  By aggregating values at the community level, the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 test eliminated the outliers at both ends of the spectrum and provided some predictability as to what constitutes obscene speech.  But community standards also serve as a shield to protect audience members, by allowing people to self-sort based on their preferences.  Those who abhor and those who tolerate sexually explicit speech can seek out like-minded people and settle in communities that share their views on what is acceptable for themselves and their children.  This sorting mechanism, however, does not exist in cyberspace; the audience cannot self-segregate.  As a result, in the context of the Internet this shield also becomes a sword, because the community that wishes to live without certain material not only rids itself, but the entire Internet of the offending speech.

						 It is hardly a solution to say, as Justice Thomas suggests, ante, at 19, that a speaker need only choose a different medium in order to avoid having its speech judged by the least tolerant community.  Our overbreadth doctrine would quickly become a toothless protection if we were to hold that substituting a more limited forum for expression is an acceptable price to pay.  Since a content-based restriction is presumptively invalid, I would place the burden on parents to &#x93;take the simple step of utilizing a medium that enables,&#x94; ante, at 19, them to avoid this material before requiring the speaker to find another forum.

						 Justice Breyer seeks to avoid the problem by effectively reading the phrase &#x93;contemporary national standards&#x94; into the statute, ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  While the legislative history of COPA provides some support for this reading, it is contradicted by the clear text of the statute, which directs jurors to consider &#x93;community&#x94; standards.  This phrase is a term of art that has taken on a particular meaning in light of our precedent.  Although we have never held that applying a national standard would be constitutionally impermissible, we have said that asking a jury to do so is &#x93;an exercise in futility,&#x94; Miller v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">30</a> (1973)

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a> (1974)
.  Any lingering doubts about the meaning of the phrase were certainly dispelled by our discussion of the issue in ACLU I, 521 U. S., at 874, n. 39, and we presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of our decisions.  Therefore, Justice Thomas has correctly refused to rewrite the statute to substitute a standard that Congress clearly did not choose.  And even if the Court were willing to do so, we would still have to acknowledge, as petitioner does, that jurors instructed to apply a national, or adult, standard, will reach widely different conclusions throughout the country, see ante, at 12; Brief for Petitioner 39.

						 The Court also notes that the limitation to communications made for commercial purposes narrows the category of speech as compared to the CDA, ante, at 5.  While it is certainly true that this condition limits the scope of the statute, the phrase &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; is somewhat misleading.  The definition of commercial purposes, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#e_2_B" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(e)(2)(B)</a>, covers anyone who generates revenue from advertisements or merchandise, regardless of the amount of advertising or whether the advertisements or products are related to the images that allegedly are harmful to minors.  As the District Court noted: &#x93;There is nothing in the text of the COPA, however, that limits its applicability to so-called commercial pornographers only; indeed, the text of COPA imposes liability on a speaker who knowingly makes any communication for commercial purposes &#x91;that includes any material that is harmful to minors,&#x92; &#x94; App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a.  In the context of the Internet, this is hardly a serious limitation.  A 1998 study, for example, found that 83 percent of Web sites contain commercial content.  Lawrence &amp; Giles, Accessibility of information of the web, 400 Nature 107&#x96;109 (1999); Guernsey, Seek&#x97;but on the Web, You Might Not Find, N. Y. Times, July 8, 1999, p. G3.  Interestingly, this same study found that only 1.5 percent of the 2.8 million sites cataloged contained pornographic content.

						 Justice Kennedy accuses the Court of Appeals of evaluating overbreadth in a vacuum by dismissing most of the concerns raised by the District Court, ante, at 8.  But most of those concerns went to whether COPA survives strict scrutiny, not overbreadth.  Even under Justice Kennedy&#x92;s formulation, it is unclear why it is relevant to an overbreadth analysis, for example, whether COPA could have been more narrowly tailored, whether the affirmative defenses impose too great a burden, or whether inclusion of criminal as well as civil penalties was excessive.

				Appeals to prurient interests are commonplace on the Internet, as in older media.  Many of those appeals lack serious value for minors as well as adults.  Some are offensive to certain viewers but welcomed by others.  For decades, our cases have recognized that the standards for judging their acceptability vary from viewer to viewer and from community to community.  Those cases developed the requirement that communications should be protected if they do not violate contemporary community standards.  In its original form, the community standard provided a shield for communications that are offensive only to the least tolerant members of society.  Thus, the Court &#x93;has emphasized on more than one occasion that a principal concern in requiring that a judgment be made on the basis of &#x92;contemporary community standards&#x92; is to assure that the material is judged neither on the basis of each juror&#x92;s personal opinion, nor by its effect on a particularly sensitive or insensitive person or group.&#x94;

.  In the context of the Internet, however, community standards become a sword, rather than a shield.  If a prurient appeal is offensive in a puritan village, it may be a crime to post it on the World Wide Web.

				COPA not only restricts speech that is made available to the general public, it also covers a medium in which speech cannot be segregated to avoid communities where it is likely to be considered harmful to minors.  The Internet presents a unique forum for communication because information, once posted, is accessible everywhere on the network at once.  The speaker cannot control access based on the location of the listener, nor can it choose the pathways through which its speech is transmitted.  By approving the use of community standards in this context,

It is true that, in addition to COPA&#x92;s &#x93;appeals to the prurient interest of minors&#x94; prong, the material must be &#x93;patently offensive with respect to minors&#x94; and it must lack &#x93;serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value for minors.&#x94;

Whatever disparity exists between various communities&#x92; assessment of the content that appeals to the prurient interest of minors will surely be matched by their differing opinions as to whether descriptions of sexual acts or depictions of nudity are patently offensive with respect to minors.

				Petitioner&#x92;s argument that the &#x93;serious value&#x94; prong minimizes the statute&#x92;s overbreadth is also unpersuasive.  Although we have recognized that the serious value determination in obscenity cases should be based on an objective, reasonable person standard,

				<em>

				</em>
				.  Congress reasonably concluded that a substantial number of works, which have serious value for adults, do not have serious value for minors.  Cf.

				<em>

				</em>
				, they do not necessarily have any such value for 
				<em>
					minors
				</em>
				&#x94;).  Thus, even though the serious value prong limits the total amount of speech covered by the statute, it remains true that there is a significant amount of protected speech within the category of materials that have no serious value for minors.  That speech is effectively prohibited whenever the least tolerant communities find it harmful to minors.

				  While the objective nature of the inquiry may eliminate any worry that the serious value determination will be made by the least tolerant community, it does not change the fact that, within the subset of images deemed to have no serious value for minors, the decision whether minors and adults throughout the country will have access to that speech will still be made by the most restrictive community.

According to his view, we cannot determine whether the statute is substantially overbroad based on its use of community standards without first determining how much of the speech on the Internet is saved by the other restrictions in the statute.  But this represents a fundamental misconception of our overbreadth doctrine.  As Justice White explained in

				</em>
				&#x94; (Emphasis added.)  Regardless of how the Court of Appeals interprets the &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; or &#x93;as a whole&#x94; provisions on remand, the question we must answer is whether the statute restricts a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its legitimate sweep by virtue of the fact that it uses community standards.

				  These other provisions may reduce the absolute number of Web pages covered by the statute, but even the narrowest version of the statute abridges a substantial amount of protected speech that many communities would not find harmful to minors.  Because Web speakers cannot limit access to those specific communities, the statute is substantially overbroad regardless of how its other provisions are construed.

				Even if most, if not all, of these works would be excluded from COPA&#x92;s coverage by the serious value prong, they illustrate the diversity of public opinion on the underlying themes depicted.  This diversity of views surely extends to whether materials with the same themes, that do not have serious value for minors, appeal to their prurient interests and are patently offensive.  There is no reason to think the differences between communities&#x92; standards will disappear once the image or description is no longer within the context of a work that has serious value for minors.

				  Because communities differ widely in their attitudes toward sex, particularly when minors are concerned, the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that, regardless of how COPA&#x92;s other provisions are construed, applying community standards to the Internet will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities.

				Whether that consequence is appropriate depends, of course, on the content of the message.  The kind of hard-core pornography involved in 
				<em>
					Hamling

Perhaps &#x93;teasers&#x94; that serve no function except to invite viewers to examine hardcore materials, or the hidden terms written into a Web site&#x92;s &#x93;metatags&#x94; in order to dupe unwitting Web surfers into visiting pornographic sites, deserve the same fate.  But COPA extends to a wide range of prurient appeals in advertisements, online magazines, Web-based bulletin boards and chat rooms, stock photo galleries, Web diaries, and a variety of illustrations encompassing a vast number of messages that are unobjectionable in most of the country and yet provide no &#x93;serious value&#x94; for minors.  It is quite wrong to allow the standards of a minority consisting of the least tolerant communities to regulate access to relatively harmless messages in this burgeoning market.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the context of most other media, using community standards to differentiate between permissible and impermissible speech has two virtues.  As mentioned above, community standards originally served as a shield to protect speakers from the least tolerant members of society.  By aggregating values at the community level, the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 test eliminated the outliers at both ends of the spectrum and provided some predictability as to what constitutes obscene speech.  But community standards also serve as a shield to protect audience members, by allowing people to self-sort based on their preferences.  Those who abhor and those who tolerate sexually explicit speech can seek out like-minded people and settle in communities that share their views on what is acceptable for themselves and their children.  This sorting mechanism, however, does not exist in cyberspace; the audience cannot self-segregate.  As a result, in the context of the Internet this shield also becomes a sword, because the community that wishes to live without certain material not only rids itself, but the entire Internet of the offending speech.

						 Petitioner cites examples of display statutes in 23 States that require magazine racks to shield minors from the covers of pornographic magazines.  Brief for Petitioner 22, 3a.  This Court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of any of these statutes, which are in any event of little relevance to regulation of speech on the Internet.  As we recognized in ACLU I, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/844" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 844</a>,

, &#x93; &#x91;the receipt of information on the Internet requires a series of affirmative steps more deliberate and directed than merely turning a dial&#x92; &#x94;&#x97;or scanning a magazine rack.

						 It is hardly a solution to say, as Justice Thomas suggests, ante, at 19, that a speaker need only choose a different medium in order to avoid having its speech judged by the least tolerant community.  Our overbreadth doctrine would quickly become a toothless protection if we were to hold that substituting a more limited forum for expression is an acceptable price to pay.  Since a content-based restriction is presumptively invalid, I would place the burden on parents to &#x93;take the simple step of utilizing a medium that enables,&#x94; ante, at 19, them to avoid this material before requiring the speaker to find another forum.

						 Justice Breyer seeks to avoid the problem by effectively reading the phrase &#x93;contemporary national standards&#x94; into the statute, ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  While the legislative history of COPA provides some support for this reading, it is contradicted by the clear text of the statute, which directs jurors to consider &#x93;community&#x94; standards.  This phrase is a term of art that has taken on a particular meaning in light of our precedent.  Although we have never held that applying a national standard would be constitutionally impermissible, we have said that asking a jury to do so is &#x93;an exercise in futility,&#x94; Miller v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">30</a> (1973)
, and that &#x93;[a] juror is entitled to draw on his own knowledge of the views of the average person in the community or vicinage from which he comes for making the required determination,&#x94; Hamling v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/418/87" class="subref" title="subref">418 U. S. 87</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a> (1974)
.  Any lingering doubts about the meaning of the phrase were certainly dispelled by our discussion of the issue in ACLU I, 521 U. S., at 874, n. 39, and we presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of our decisions.  Therefore, Justice Thomas has correctly refused to rewrite the statute to substitute a standard that Congress clearly did not choose.  And even if the Court were willing to do so, we would still have to acknowledge, as petitioner does, that jurors instructed to apply a national, or adult, standard, will reach widely different conclusions throughout the country, see ante, at 12; Brief for Petitioner 39.

						 Of course, Justice Thomas&#x92;s example of the image &#x93;of a war victim&#x92;s wounded nude body,&#x94; ante, at 15, n. 9, would not be covered by the statute unless it depicted &#x93;a lewd exhibition of the genitals or post-pubescent female breast&#x94; and lacked serious political value for minors,

						 The Court also notes that the limitation to communications made for commercial purposes narrows the category of speech as compared to the CDA, ante, at 5.  While it is certainly true that this condition limits the scope of the statute, the phrase &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; is somewhat misleading.  The definition of commercial purposes, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#e_2_B" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(e)(2)(B)</a>, covers anyone who generates revenue from advertisements or merchandise, regardless of the amount of advertising or whether the advertisements or products are related to the images that allegedly are harmful to minors.  As the District Court noted: &#x93;There is nothing in the text of the COPA, however, that limits its applicability to so-called commercial pornographers only; indeed, the text of COPA imposes liability on a speaker who knowingly makes any communication for commercial purposes &#x91;that includes any material that is harmful to minors,&#x92; &#x94; App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a.  In the context of the Internet, this is hardly a serious limitation.  A 1998 study, for example, found that 83 percent of Web sites contain commercial content.  Lawrence &amp; Giles, Accessibility of information of the web, 400 Nature 107&#x96;109 (1999); Guernsey, Seek&#x97;but on the Web, You Might Not Find, N. Y. Times, July 8, 1999, p. G3.  Interestingly, this same study found that only 1.5 percent of the 2.8 million sites cataloged contained pornographic content.

						 Justice Kennedy accuses the Court of Appeals of evaluating overbreadth in a vacuum by dismissing most of the concerns raised by the District Court, ante, at 8.  But most of those concerns went to whether COPA survives strict scrutiny, not overbreadth.  Even under Justice Kennedy&#x92;s formulation, it is unclear why it is relevant to an overbreadth analysis, for example, whether COPA could have been more narrowly tailored, whether the affirmative defenses impose too great a burden, or whether inclusion of criminal as well as civil penalties was excessive.

				Appeals to prurient interests are commonplace on the Internet, as in older media.  Many of those appeals lack serious value for minors as well as adults.  Some are offensive to certain viewers but welcomed by others.  For decades, our cases have recognized that the standards for judging their acceptability vary from viewer to viewer and from community to community.  Those cases developed the requirement that communications should be protected if they do not violate contemporary community standards.  In its original form, the community standard provided a shield for communications that are offensive only to the least tolerant members of society.  Thus, the Court &#x93;has emphasized on more than one occasion that a principal concern in requiring that a judgment be made on the basis of &#x92;contemporary community standards&#x92; is to assure that the material is judged neither on the basis of each juror&#x92;s personal opinion, nor by its effect on a particularly sensitive or insensitive person or group.&#x94;

.  In the context of the Internet, however, community standards become a sword, rather than a shield.  If a prurient appeal is offensive in a puritan village, it may be a crime to post it on the World Wide Web.

				COPA not only restricts speech that is made available to the general public, it also covers a medium in which speech cannot be segregated to avoid communities where it is likely to be considered harmful to minors.  The Internet presents a unique forum for communication because information, once posted, is accessible everywhere on the network at once.  The speaker cannot control access based on the location of the listener, nor can it choose the pathways through which its speech is transmitted.  By approving the use of community standards in this context,

Thus, even though the serious value prong limits the total amount of speech covered by the statute, it remains true that there is a significant amount of protected speech within the category of materials that have no serious value for minors.  That speech is effectively prohibited whenever the least tolerant communities find it harmful to minors.

				  While the objective nature of the inquiry may eliminate any worry that the serious value determination will be made by the least tolerant community, it does not change the fact that, within the subset of images deemed to have no serious value for minors, the decision whether minors and adults throughout the country will have access to that speech will still be made by the most restrictive community.

					Justice Kennedy

				 makes a similar misstep, 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 2 (opinion concurring in judgment), when he ties the overbreadth inquiry to questions about the scope of the other provisions of the statute.  According to his view, we cannot determine whether the statute is substantially overbroad based on its use of community standards without first determining how much of the speech on the Internet is saved by the other restrictions in the statute.  But this represents a fundamental misconception of our overbreadth doctrine.  As Justice White explained in 
				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>
					Oklahoma
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/601" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 601</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">615</a> (1973)
, &#x93;the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as well, 
				<em>
					judged in relation to the statute&#x92;s plainly legitimate sweep.
				</em>
				&#x94; (Emphasis added.)  Regardless of how the Court of Appeals interprets the &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; or &#x93;as a whole&#x94; provisions on remand, the question we must answer is whether the statute restricts a substantial amount of protected speech relative to its legitimate sweep by virtue of the fact that it uses community standards.

            </a>
				  These other provisions may reduce the absolute number of Web pages covered by the statute, but even the narrowest version of the statute abridges a substantial amount of protected speech that many communities would not find harmful to minors.  Because Web speakers cannot limit access to those specific communities, the statute is substantially overbroad regardless of how its other provisions are construed.

				Even if most, if not all, of these works would be excluded from COPA&#x92;s coverage by the serious value prong, they illustrate the diversity of public opinion on the underlying themes depicted.  This diversity of views surely extends to whether materials with the same themes, that do not have serious value for minors, appeal to their prurient interests and are patently offensive.  There is no reason to think the differences between communities&#x92; standards will disappear once the image or description is no longer within the context of a work that has serious value for minors.

				  Because communities differ widely in their attitudes toward sex, particularly when minors are concerned, the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that, regardless of how COPA&#x92;s other provisions are construed, applying community standards to the Internet will restrict a substantial amount of protected speech that would not be considered harmful to minors in many communities.              
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Whether that consequence is appropriate depends, of course, on the content of the message.  The kind of hard-core pornography involved in 
				<em>
					Hamling
				</em>
				, which I assume would be obscene under any community&#x92;s standard, does not belong on the Internet.  Perhaps &#x93;teasers&#x94; that serve no function except to invite viewers to examine hardcore materials, or the hidden terms written into a Web site&#x92;s &#x93;metatags&#x94; in order to dupe unwitting Web surfers into visiting pornographic sites, deserve the same fate.  But COPA extends to a wide range of prurient appeals in advertisements, online magazines, Web-based bulletin boards and chat rooms, stock photo galleries, Web diaries, and a variety of illustrations encompassing a vast number of messages that are unobjectionable in most of the country and yet provide no &#x93;serious value&#x94; for minors.  It is quite wrong to allow the standards of a minority consisting of the least tolerant communities to regulate access to relatively harmless messages in this burgeoning market.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In the context of most other media, using community standards to differentiate between permissible and impermissible speech has two virtues.  As mentioned above, community standards originally served as a shield to protect speakers from the least tolerant members of society.  By aggregating values at the community level, the 
				<em>
					Miller
				</em>
				 test eliminated the outliers at both ends of the spectrum and provided some predictability as to what constitutes obscene speech.  But community standards also serve as a shield to protect audience members, by allowing people to self-sort based on their preferences.  Those who abhor and those who tolerate sexually explicit speech can seek out like-minded people and settle in communities that share their views on what is acceptable for themselves and their children.  This sorting mechanism, however, does not exist in cyberspace; the audience cannot self-segregate.  As a result, in the context of the Internet this shield also becomes a sword, because the community that wishes to live without certain material not only rids itself, but the entire Internet of the offending speech.

						 Petitioner cites examples of display statutes in 23 States that require magazine racks to shield minors from the covers of pornographic magazines.  Brief for Petitioner 22, 3a.  This Court has yet to rule on the constitutionality of any of these statutes, which are in any event of little relevance to regulation of speech on the Internet.  As we recognized in ACLU I, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/844" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 844</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">854</a> (1997)

						 It is hardly a solution to say, as Justice Thomas suggests, ante, at 19, that a speaker need only choose a different medium in order to avoid having its speech judged by the least tolerant community.  Our overbreadth doctrine would quickly become a toothless protection if we were to hold that substituting a more limited forum for expression is an acceptable price to pay.  Since a content-based restriction is presumptively invalid, I would place the burden on parents to &#x93;take the simple step of utilizing a medium that enables,&#x94; ante, at 19, them to avoid this material before requiring the speaker to find another forum.

						 Justice Breyer seeks to avoid the problem by effectively reading the phrase &#x93;contemporary national standards&#x94; into the statute, ante, at 1 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  While the legislative history of COPA provides some support for this reading, it is contradicted by the clear text of the statute, which directs jurors to consider &#x93;community&#x94; standards.  This phrase is a term of art that has taken on a particular meaning in light of our precedent.  Although we have never held that applying a national standard would be constitutionally impermissible, we have said that asking a jury to do so is &#x93;an exercise in futility,&#x94; Miller v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/413/15" class="subref" title="subref">413 U. S. 15</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">30</a> (1973)
, and that &#x93;[a] juror is entitled to draw on his own knowledge of the views of the average person in the community or vicinage from which he comes for making the required determination,&#x94; Hamling v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/418/87" class="subref" title="subref">418 U. S. 87</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">104</a> (1974)
.  Any lingering doubts about the meaning of the phrase were certainly dispelled by our discussion of the issue in ACLU I, 521 U. S., at 874, n. 39, and we presume that Congress legislates against the backdrop of our decisions.  Therefore, Justice Thomas has correctly refused to rewrite the statute to substitute a standard that Congress clearly did not choose.  And even if the Court were willing to do so, we would still have to acknowledge, as petitioner does, that jurors instructed to apply a national, or adult, standard, will reach widely different conclusions throughout the country, see ante, at 12; Brief for Petitioner 39.

						 Of course, Justice Thomas&#x92;s example of the image &#x93;of a war victim&#x92;s wounded nude body,&#x94; ante, at 15, n. 9, would not be covered by the statute unless it depicted &#x93;a lewd exhibition of the genitals or post-pubescent female breast&#x94; and lacked serious political value for minors,

						 The Court also notes that the limitation to communications made for commercial purposes narrows the category of speech as compared to the CDA, ante, at 5.  While it is certainly true that this condition limits the scope of the statute, the phrase &#x93;commercial purposes&#x94; is somewhat misleading.  The definition of commercial purposes, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/47/231.html#e_2_B" class="subref" title="subref">47 U. S. C. &#xA7;231(e)(2)(B)</a>, covers anyone who generates revenue from advertisements or merchandise, regardless of the amount of advertising or whether the advertisements or products are related to the images that allegedly are harmful to minors.  As the District Court noted: &#x93;There is nothing in the text of the COPA, however, that limits its applicability to so-called commercial pornographers only; indeed, the text of COPA imposes liability on a speaker who knowingly makes any communication for commercial purposes &#x91;that includes any material that is harmful to minors,&#x92; &#x94; App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a.  In the context of the Internet, this is hardly a serious limitation.  A 1998 study, for example, found that 83 percent of Web sites contain commercial content.  Lawrence &amp; Giles, Accessibility of information of the web, 400 Nature 107&#x96;109 (1999); Guernsey, Seek&#x97;but on the Web, You Might Not Find, N. Y. Times, July 8, 1999, p. G3.  Interestingly, this same study found that only 1.5 percent of the 2.8 million sites cataloged contained pornographic content.

						 Justice Kennedy accuses the Court of Appeals of evaluating overbreadth in a vacuum by dismissing most of the concerns raised by the District Court, ante, at 8.  But most of those concerns went to whether COPA survives strict scrutiny, not overbreadth.  Even under Justice Kennedy&#x92;s formulation, it is unclear why it is relevant to an overbreadth analysis, for example, whether COPA could have been more narrowly tailored, whether the affirmative defenses impose too great a burden, or whether inclusion of criminal as well as civil penalties was excessive.

						 Nor is there any reason to expect that a particular community&#x92;s view of the material will change based on how the Court of Appeals construes the statute&#x92;s &#x93;for commercial purposes&#x94; or &#x93;as a whole&#x94; provisions.
