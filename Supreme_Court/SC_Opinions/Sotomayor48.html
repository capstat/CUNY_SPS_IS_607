				Petitioner Harvey Leroy Sossamon III is an inmate in the Robertson Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division.  In 2006, Sossamon sued the State of Texas and various prison officials in their official capacities under RLUIPA&#x92;s private cause of action, seeking injunctive and monetary relief.  Sossamon alleged that two prison policies violated RLUIPA: (1) a policy preventing inmates from attending religious services while on cell restriction for disciplinary infractions; and (2) a policy barring use of the prison chapel for religious worship.  The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents and held, as relevant here, that sovereign immunity barred Sossamon&#x92;s claims for monetary relief.

				  Far from clearly identifying money damages, the word &#x93;appropriate&#x94; is inherently context-dependent.  See Webster&#x92;s Third New International Dictionary 106 (1993) (defining &#x93;appropriate&#x94; as &#x93;specially suitable:

The question was whether the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has authority to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act against the Federal Government &#x93;through appropriate remedies,&#x94; could require the Federal Government to pay damages.

				Sossamon argues that, because RLUIPA expressly limits the United States to &#x93;injunctive or declaratory relief &#x94; to enforce the statute, the phrase &#x93;appropriate re-lief &#x94; in the private cause of action necessarily must be broader.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-2.html#f" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;2(f)</a>.  Texas responds that, because the State has no immunity defense to a suit brought by the Federal Government, Congress needed to exclude damages affirmatively in that context but not in the context of private suits.  Further, the private cause of action provides that a person may assert a violation of the statute &#x93;as a claim 
				<em>
					or defense
				</em>
				.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;2(a) (emphasis added).
				<em>
					  
				</em>
				Because an injunction or declaratory judgment is not &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; for a successful defense, Texas explains, explicitly limiting the private cause of action to those forms of relief would make no sense.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Sossamon also emphasizes that the statute requires that it be &#x93;construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;3(g).  Texas responds that this provision is best read as addressing the substantive standards in the statute, not the scope of &#x93;appropriate relief.&#x94;  Texas also highlights Congress&#x92; choice of the word &#x93;relief,&#x94; which it argues primarily connotes equitable relief.  See Black&#x92;s Law Dictionary 1295 (7th ed. 1999) (defining &#x93;relief &#x94; as &#x93;[t]he redress or benefit, esp. equitable in nature &#x2026; , that a party asks of a court&#x94;).

				These plausible arguments demonstrate that the phrase &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; in RLUIPA is not so free from ambiguity that we may conclude that the States, by receiving federal funds, have unequivocally expressed intent to waive their sovereign immunity to suits for damages.  Strictly construing that phrase in favor of the sovereign&#x97;as we must, see 
				<em>

				In any event, applying ordinary contract principles here would make little sense because contracts with a sovereign are unique.  They do not traditionally confer a right of action for damages to enforce compliance: &#x93; &#x91;The contracts between a Nation and an individual are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign and have no pretensions to compulsive force.

				More fundamentally, Sossamon&#x92;s implied-contract-remedies proposal cannot be squared with our longstanding rule that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be expressly and unequivocally stated in the text of the relevant statute.  It would be bizarre to create an &#x93;unequivocal statement&#x94; rule and then find that every Spending Clause enactment, no matter what its text, satisfies that rule because it includes unexpressed, implied remedies against the States.  The requirement of a clear statement in the text of the statute ensures that Congress has specifically considered state sovereign immunity and has intentionally legislated on the matter.  Cf.

 (plurality opinion) (&#x93;[C]lear statement rules ensure Congress does not, by broad or general language, legislate on a sensitive topic inadvertently or without due deliberation&#x94;).  Without such a clear statement from Congress and notice to the States, federal courts may not step in and abrogate state sovereign immunity.

				Sossamon also argues that &#xA7;1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000d-7.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;2000d&#x96;7</a>, independently put the State on notice that it could be sued for damages under RLUIPA.  That provision expressly waives state sovereign immunity for violations of &#x93;section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
				<em>
					or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance
				</em>
				.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000d&#x96;7(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Section 1003 makes &#x93;remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) &#x2026; available for such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are available for such a violation in the suit against any public or private entity other than a State.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000d&#x96;7(a)(2).  Sossamon contends that &#xA7;3 of RLUIPA falls within the residual clause of &#xA7;1003 and therefore &#xA7;1003 waives Texas&#x92; sovereign immunity to RLUIPA suits for damages.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even assuming that a residual clause like the one in &#xA7;1003 could constitute an unequivocal textual waiver, &#xA7;3 is not unequivocally a &#x93;statute prohibiting discrimination&#x94; within the meaning of &#xA7;1003.

				  The text of &#xA7;3 does not prohibit &#x93;discrimination&#x94;; rather, it prohibits &#x93;substantial burden[s]&#x94; on religious exercise.  This distinction is especially conspicuous in light of &#xA7;2 of RLUIPA, in which Congress expressly prohibited &#x93;land use regulation[s] that discriminat[e] &#x2026; on the basis of religion.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000cc(b)(2).

The Court of Appeals subsequently held that Sossamon&#x92;s claim for injunctive relief with respect to the cell-restriction policy was moot because the State had abandoned that policy after Sossamon filed a prison grievance.  560 F. 3d 316, 326 (CA5 2009).

						 Nor can it be said that this Court&#x92;s use of the phrase &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; in Franklin and Barnes somehow put the States on notice that the same phrase in RLUIPA subjected them to suits for monetary relief.  Those cases did not involve sovereign defendants, so the Court had no occasion to consider sovereign immunity.  Liability against nonsovereigns could not put the States on notice that they would be liable in the same manner, absent an unequivocal textual waiver.  Moreover, the same phrase in RFRA had been interpreted not to include damages relief against the Federal Government or the States and so could have signaled to the States that damages are not &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; under RLUIPA.  See, e.g., Tinsley v. Pittari, 952 F. Supp. 384, 389 (ND Tex. 1996); Commack Self-Service Kosher Meats Inc. v. New York, 954 F. Supp. 65, 69 (EDNY 1997).

						 The dissent finds our decision &#x93;difficult to understand,&#x94; post, at 6 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.), but it follows naturally from this Court&#x92;s precedents regarding waiver of sovereign immunity, which the dissent gives astonishingly short shrift.  The dissent instead concerns itself primarily with &#x93;general remedies principles.&#x94;  Post, at 1.  The essence of sovereign immunity, however, is that remedies against the government differ from &#x93;general remedies principles&#x94; applicable to private litigants.  See, e.g., Lane v. Pe&#x144;a, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/518/187" class="subref" title="subref">518 U. S. 187</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">196</a> (1996)
 (calling it a &#x93;crucial point that, when it comes to an award of money damages, sovereign immunity places the &#x2026; Government on an entirely different footing than private parties&#x94;).

						 Sossamon argues that &#xA7;3 resembles &#xA7;504 of the Rehabilitation Act, one of the statutes listed in &#xA7;1003, because both require special accommodations for particular people or activities.  By Sossamon&#x92;s reasoning, every Spending Clause statute that arguably provides a benefit to a class of people or activities would become a federal statute &#x93;prohibiting discrimination,&#x94; thereby waiving sovereign immunity.  Such an interpretation cannot be squared with the foundational rule that waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed and strictly construed.

				Petitioner Harvey Leroy Sossamon III is an inmate in the Robertson Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division.  In 2006, Sossamon sued the State of Texas and various prison officials in their official capacities under RLUIPA&#x92;s private cause of action, seeking injunctive and monetary relief.  Sossamon alleged that two prison policies violated RLUIPA: (1) a policy preventing inmates from attending religious services while on cell restriction for disciplinary infractions; and (2) a policy barring use of the prison chapel for religious worship.  The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents and held, as relevant here, that sovereign immunity barred Sossamon&#x92;s claims for monetary relief.

				The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  560 F. 3d 316, 329 (2009).  Acknowledging that Congress enacted RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the court determined that Texas had not waived its sovereign immunity by accepting federal funds.  The Court of Appeals strictly construed the text of RLUIPA&#x92;s cause of action in favor of the State and concluded that the statutory phrase &#x93;appropriate relief against a government&#x94; did not &#x93;unambiguously notif[y]&#x94; Texas that its acceptance of funds was conditioned on a waiver of immunity from claims for money damages.

				  Far from clearly identifying money damages, the word &#x93;appropriate&#x94; is inherently context-dependent.  See Webster&#x92;s Third New International Dictionary 106 (1993) (defining &#x93;appropriate&#x94; as &#x93;specially suitable:

The question was whether the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has authority to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act against the Federal Government &#x93;through appropriate remedies,&#x94; could require the Federal Government to pay damages.

				Sossamon argues that, because RLUIPA expressly limits the United States to &#x93;injunctive or declaratory relief &#x94; to enforce the statute, the phrase &#x93;appropriate re-lief &#x94; in the private cause of action necessarily must be broader.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-2.html#f" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;2(f)</a>.  Texas responds that, because the State has no immunity defense to a suit brought by the Federal Government, Congress needed to exclude damages affirmatively in that context but not in the context of private suits.  Further, the private cause of action provides that a person may assert a violation of the statute &#x93;as a claim 
				<em>
					or defense
				</em>
				.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;2(a) (emphasis added).
				<em>
					  
				</em>
				Because an injunction or declaratory judgment is not &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; for a successful defense, Texas explains, explicitly limiting the private cause of action to those forms of relief would make no sense.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Sossamon also emphasizes that the statute requires that it be &#x93;construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;3(g).  Texas responds that this provision is best read as addressing the substantive standards in the statute, not the scope of &#x93;appropriate relief.&#x94;  Texas also highlights Congress&#x92; choice of the word &#x93;relief,&#x94; which it argues primarily connotes equitable relief.  See Black&#x92;s Law Dictionary 1295 (7th ed. 1999) (defining &#x93;relief &#x94; as &#x93;[t]he redress or benefit, esp. equitable in nature &#x2026; , that a party asks of a court&#x94;).

				These plausible arguments demonstrate that the phrase &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; in RLUIPA is not so free from ambiguity that we may conclude that the States, by receiving federal funds, have unequivocally expressed intent to waive their sovereign immunity to suits for damages.  Strictly construing that phrase in favor of the sovereign&#x97;as we must, see 
				<em>

				Sossamon contends that, because Congress enacted &#xA7;3 of RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the States were necessarily on notice that they would be liable for damages.

				In any event, applying ordinary contract principles here would make little sense because contracts with a sovereign are unique.  They do not traditionally confer a right of action for damages to enforce compliance: &#x93; &#x91;The contracts between a Nation and an individual are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign and have no pretensions to compulsive force.  They confer no right of action independent of the sovereign will.&#x92; &#x94;

				More fundamentally, Sossamon&#x92;s implied-contract-remedies proposal cannot be squared with our longstanding rule that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be expressly and unequivocally stated in the text of the relevant statute.  It would be bizarre to create an &#x93;unequivocal statement&#x94; rule and then find that every Spending Clause enactment, no matter what its text, satisfies that rule because it includes unexpressed, implied remedies against the States.  The requirement of a clear statement in the text of the statute ensures that Congress has specifically considered state sovereign immunity and has intentionally legislated on the matter.  Cf.

 (plurality opinion) (&#x93;[C]lear statement rules ensure Congress does not, by broad or general language, legislate on a sensitive topic inadvertently or without due deliberation&#x94;).  Without such a clear statement from Congress and notice to the States, federal courts may not step in and abrogate state sovereign immunity.

				Sossamon also argues that &#xA7;1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000d-7.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;2000d&#x96;7</a>, independently put the State on notice that it could be sued for damages under RLUIPA.  That provision expressly waives state sovereign immunity for violations of &#x93;section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
				<em>
					or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance
				</em>
				.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000d&#x96;7(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Section 1003 makes &#x93;remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) &#x2026; available for such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are available for such a violation in the suit against any public or private entity other than a State.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000d&#x96;7(a)(2).  Sossamon contends that &#xA7;3 of RLUIPA falls within the residual clause of &#xA7;1003 and therefore &#xA7;1003 waives Texas&#x92; sovereign immunity to RLUIPA suits for damages.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even assuming that a residual clause like the one in &#xA7;1003 could constitute an unequivocal textual waiver, &#xA7;3 is not unequivocally a &#x93;statute prohibiting discrimination&#x94; within the meaning of &#xA7;1003.

				  The text of &#xA7;3 does not prohibit &#x93;discrimination&#x94;; rather, it prohibits &#x93;substantial burden[s]&#x94; on religious exercise.  This distinction is especially conspicuous in light of &#xA7;2 of RLUIPA, in which Congress expressly prohibited &#x93;land use regulation[s] that discriminat[e] &#x2026; on the basis of religion.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000cc(b)(2).

The Court of Appeals subsequently held that Sossamon&#x92;s claim for injunctive relief with respect to the cell-restriction policy was moot because the State had abandoned that policy after Sossamon filed a prison grievance.  560 F. 3d 316, 326 (CA5 2009).  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court with respect to Sossamon&#x92;s chapel-use policy claim, id., at 331&#x96;335, although the Robertson Unit later amended that policy also and now permits inmates to attend scheduled worship services in the chapel subject to certain safety precautions.

						 Although Lane concerned the Federal Government, the strict construction principle, which flows logically from the requirement that consent be &#x93;unequivocally expressed,&#x94; applies to the sovereign immunity of the States as well.  Cf. United States v. Nordic Village, Inc.,

						 Nor can it be said that this Court&#x92;s use of the phrase &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; in Franklin and Barnes somehow put the States on notice that the same phrase in RLUIPA subjected them to suits for monetary relief.  Those cases did not involve sovereign defendants, so the Court had no occasion to consider sovereign immunity.  Liability against nonsovereigns could not put the States on notice that they would be liable in the same manner, absent an unequivocal textual waiver.  Moreover, the same phrase in RFRA had been interpreted not to include damages relief against the Federal Government or the States and so could have signaled to the States that damages are not &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; under RLUIPA.  See, e.g., Tinsley v. Pittari, 952 F. Supp. 384, 389 (ND Tex. 1996); Commack Self-Service Kosher Meats Inc. v. New York, 954 F. Supp. 65, 69 (EDNY 1997).

						 The dissent finds our decision &#x93;difficult to understand,&#x94; post, at 6 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.), but it follows naturally from this Court&#x92;s precedents regarding waiver of sovereign immunity, which the dissent gives astonishingly short shrift.  The dissent instead concerns itself primarily with &#x93;general remedies principles.&#x94;  Post, at 1.  The essence of sovereign immunity, however, is that remedies against the government differ from &#x93;general remedies principles&#x94; applicable to private litigants.  See, e.g., Lane v. Pe&#x144;a, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/518/187" class="subref" title="subref">518 U. S. 187</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">196</a> (1996)
 (calling it a &#x93;crucial point that, when it comes to an award of money damages, sovereign immunity places the &#x2026; Government on an entirely different footing than private parties&#x94;).

						 Sossamon argues that &#xA7;3 resembles &#xA7;504 of the Rehabilitation Act, one of the statutes listed in &#xA7;1003, because both require special accommodations for particular people or activities.  By Sossamon&#x92;s reasoning, every Spending Clause statute that arguably provides a benefit to a class of people or activities would become a federal statute &#x93;prohibiting discrimination,&#x94; thereby waiving sovereign immunity.  Such an interpretation cannot be squared with the foundational rule that waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed and strictly construed.

Sossamon alleged that two prison policies violated RLUIPA: (1) a policy preventing inmates from attending religious services while on cell restriction for disciplinary infractions; and (2) a policy barring use of the prison chapel for religious worship.  The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents and held, as relevant here, that sovereign immunity barred Sossamon&#x92;s claims for monetary relief.

				The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed.  560 F. 3d 316, 329 (2009).  Acknowledging that Congress enacted RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the court determined that Texas had not waived its sovereign immunity by accepting federal funds.  The Court of Appeals strictly construed the text of RLUIPA&#x92;s cause of action in favor of the State and concluded that the statutory phrase &#x93;appropriate relief against a government&#x94; did not &#x93;unambiguously notif[y]&#x94; Texas that its acceptance of funds was conditioned on a waiver of immunity from claims for money damages.

				  Far from clearly identifying money damages, the word &#x93;appropriate&#x94; is inherently context-dependent.  See Webster&#x92;s Third New International Dictionary 106 (1993) (defining &#x93;appropriate&#x94; as &#x93;specially suitable:

The question was whether the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has authority to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act against the Federal Government &#x93;through appropriate remedies,&#x94; could require the Federal Government to pay damages.

				Sossamon argues that, because RLUIPA expressly limits the United States to &#x93;injunctive or declaratory relief &#x94; to enforce the statute, the phrase &#x93;appropriate re-lief &#x94; in the private cause of action necessarily must be broader.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-2.html#f" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;2(f)</a>.  Texas responds that, because the State has no immunity defense to a suit brought by the Federal Government, Congress needed to exclude damages affirmatively in that context but not in the context of private suits.  Further, the private cause of action provides that a person may assert a violation of the statute &#x93;as a claim 
				<em>
					or defense
				</em>
				.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;2(a) (emphasis added).
				<em>
					  
				</em>
				Because an injunction or declaratory judgment is not &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; for a successful defense, Texas explains, explicitly limiting the private cause of action to those forms of relief would make no sense.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Sossamon also emphasizes that the statute requires that it be &#x93;construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;3(g).  Texas responds that this provision is best read as addressing the substantive standards in the statute, not the scope of &#x93;appropriate relief.&#x94;  Texas also highlights Congress&#x92; choice of the word &#x93;relief,&#x94; which it argues primarily connotes equitable relief.  See Black&#x92;s Law Dictionary 1295 (7th ed. 1999) (defining &#x93;relief &#x94; as &#x93;[t]he redress or benefit, esp. equitable in nature &#x2026; , that a party asks of a court&#x94;).

				These plausible arguments demonstrate that the phrase &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; in RLUIPA is not so free from ambiguity that we may conclude that the States, by receiving federal funds, have unequivocally expressed intent to waive their sovereign immunity to suits for damages.  Strictly construing that phrase in favor of the sovereign&#x97;as we must, see 
				<em>

				Sossamon contends that, because Congress enacted &#xA7;3 of RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the States were necessarily on notice that they would be liable for damages.  He argues that Spending Clause legislation operates as a contract and damages are always available relief for a breach of contract, whether the contract explicitly includes a damages remedy or not.  Relying on 
				<em>

				In any event, applying ordinary contract principles here would make little sense because contracts with a sovereign are unique.  They do not traditionally confer a right of action for damages to enforce compliance: &#x93; &#x91;The contracts between a Nation and an individual are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign and have no pretensions to compulsive force.

				More fundamentally, Sossamon&#x92;s implied-contract-remedies proposal cannot be squared with our longstanding rule that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be expressly and unequivocally stated in the text of the relevant statute.  It would be bizarre to create an &#x93;unequivocal statement&#x94; rule and then find that every Spending Clause enactment, no matter what its text, satisfies that rule because it includes unexpressed, implied remedies against the States.  The requirement of a clear statement in the text of the statute ensures that Congress has specifically considered state sovereign immunity and has intentionally legislated on the matter.  Cf.

 (plurality opinion) (&#x93;[C]lear statement rules ensure Congress does not, by broad or general language, legislate on a sensitive topic inadvertently or without due deliberation&#x94;).  Without such a clear statement from Congress and notice to the States, federal courts may not step in and abrogate state sovereign immunity.

				Sossamon also argues that &#xA7;1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000d-7.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;2000d&#x96;7</a>, independently put the State on notice that it could be sued for damages under RLUIPA.  That provision expressly waives state sovereign immunity for violations of &#x93;section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
				<em>
					or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance
				</em>
				.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000d&#x96;7(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Section 1003 makes &#x93;remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) &#x2026; available for such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are available for such a violation in the suit against any public or private entity other than a State.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000d&#x96;7(a)(2).  Sossamon contends that &#xA7;3 of RLUIPA falls within the residual clause of &#xA7;1003 and therefore &#xA7;1003 waives Texas&#x92; sovereign immunity to RLUIPA suits for damages.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even assuming that a residual clause like the one in &#xA7;1003 could constitute an unequivocal textual waiver, &#xA7;3 is not unequivocally a &#x93;statute prohibiting discrimination&#x94; within the meaning of &#xA7;1003.

				  The text of &#xA7;3 does not prohibit &#x93;discrimination&#x94;; rather, it prohibits &#x93;substantial burden[s]&#x94; on religious exercise.  This distinction is especially conspicuous in light of &#xA7;2 of RLUIPA, in which Congress expressly prohibited &#x93;land use regulation[s] that discriminat[e] &#x2026; on the basis of religion.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000cc(b)(2).

The Court of Appeals subsequently held that Sossamon&#x92;s claim for injunctive relief with respect to the cell-restriction policy was moot because the State had abandoned that policy after Sossamon filed a prison grievance.  560 F. 3d 316, 326 (CA5 2009).  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court with respect to Sossamon&#x92;s chapel-use policy claim, id., at 331&#x96;335, although the Robertson Unit later amended that policy also and now permits inmates to attend scheduled worship services in the chapel subject to certain safety precautions.

						 Although Lane concerned the Federal Government, the strict construction principle, which flows logically from the requirement that consent be &#x93;unequivocally expressed,&#x94; applies to the sovereign immunity of the States as well.  Cf. United States v. Nordic Village, Inc.,

						 Nor can it be said that this Court&#x92;s use of the phrase &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; in Franklin and Barnes somehow put the States on notice that the same phrase in RLUIPA subjected them to suits for monetary relief.  Those cases did not involve sovereign defendants, so the Court had no occasion to consider sovereign immunity.  Liability against nonsovereigns could not put the States on notice that they would be liable in the same manner, absent an unequivocal textual waiver.  Moreover, the same phrase in RFRA had been interpreted not to include damages relief against the Federal Government or the States and so could have signaled to the States that damages are not &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; under RLUIPA.  See, e.g., Tinsley v. Pittari, 952 F. Supp. 384, 389 (ND Tex. 1996); Commack Self-Service Kosher Meats Inc. v. New York, 954 F. Supp. 65, 69 (EDNY 1997).

						 The dissent finds our decision &#x93;difficult to understand,&#x94; post, at 6 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.), but it follows naturally from this Court&#x92;s precedents regarding waiver of sovereign immunity, which the dissent gives astonishingly short shrift.  The dissent instead concerns itself primarily with &#x93;general remedies principles.&#x94;  Post, at 1.  The essence of sovereign immunity, however, is that remedies against the government differ from &#x93;general remedies principles&#x94; applicable to private litigants.  See, e.g., Lane v. Pe&#x144;a, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/518/187" class="subref" title="subref">518 U. S. 187</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">196</a> (1996)
 (calling it a &#x93;crucial point that, when it comes to an award of money damages, sovereign immunity places the &#x2026; Government on an entirely different footing than private parties&#x94;).

						 Sossamon argues that &#xA7;3 resembles &#xA7;504 of the Rehabilitation Act, one of the statutes listed in &#xA7;1003, because both require special accommodations for particular people or activities.  By Sossamon&#x92;s reasoning, every Spending Clause statute that arguably provides a benefit to a class of people or activities would become a federal statute &#x93;prohibiting discrimination,&#x94; thereby waiving sovereign immunity.  Such an interpretation cannot be squared with the foundational rule that waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed and strictly construed.

				Petitioner Harvey Leroy Sossamon III is an inmate in the Robertson Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division.  In 2006, Sossamon sued the State of Texas and various prison officials in their official capacities under RLUIPA&#x92;s private cause of action, seeking injunctive and monetary relief.  Sossamon alleged that two prison policies violated RLUIPA: (1) a policy preventing inmates from attending religious services while on cell restriction for disciplinary infractions; and (2) a policy barring use of the prison chapel for religious worship.  The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents and held, as relevant here, that sovereign immunity barred Sossamon&#x92;s claims for monetary relief.

				  Far from clearly identifying money damages, the word &#x93;appropriate&#x94; is inherently context-dependent.  See Webster&#x92;s Third New International Dictionary 106 (1993) (defining &#x93;appropriate&#x94; as &#x93;specially suitable:

The question was whether the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has authority to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act against the Federal Government &#x93;through appropriate remedies,&#x94; could require the Federal Government to pay damages.

				Sossamon argues that, because RLUIPA expressly limits the United States to &#x93;injunctive or declaratory relief &#x94; to enforce the statute, the phrase &#x93;appropriate re-lief &#x94; in the private cause of action necessarily must be broader.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-2.html#f" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;2(f)</a>.  Texas responds that, because the State has no immunity defense to a suit brought by the Federal Government, Congress needed to exclude damages affirmatively in that context but not in the context of private suits.  Further, the private cause of action provides that a person may assert a violation of the statute &#x93;as a claim 
				<em>
					or defense
				</em>
				.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;2(a) (emphasis added).
				<em>
					  
				</em>
				Because an injunction or declaratory judgment is not &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; for a successful defense, Texas explains, explicitly limiting the private cause of action to those forms of relief would make no sense.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Sossamon also emphasizes that the statute requires that it be &#x93;construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;3(g).  Texas responds that this provision is best read as addressing the substantive standards in the statute, not the scope of &#x93;appropriate relief.&#x94;  Texas also highlights Congress&#x92; choice of the word &#x93;relief,&#x94; which it argues primarily connotes equitable relief.  See Black&#x92;s Law Dictionary 1295 (7th ed. 1999) (defining &#x93;relief &#x94; as &#x93;[t]he redress or benefit, esp. equitable in nature &#x2026; , that a party asks of a court&#x94;).

				These plausible arguments demonstrate that the phrase &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; in RLUIPA is not so free from ambiguity that we may conclude that the States, by receiving federal funds, have unequivocally expressed intent to waive their sovereign immunity to suits for damages.

				Sossamon contends that, because Congress enacted &#xA7;3 of RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the States were necessarily on notice that they would be liable for damages.  He argues that Spending Clause legislation operates as a contract and damages are always available relief for a breach of contract, whether the contract explicitly includes a damages remedy or not.  Relying on 
				<em>

				In any event, applying ordinary contract principles here would make little sense because contracts with a sovereign are unique.  They do not traditionally confer a right of action for damages to enforce compliance: &#x93; &#x91;The contracts between a Nation and an individual are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign and have no pretensions to compulsive force.

				More fundamentally, Sossamon&#x92;s implied-contract-remedies proposal cannot be squared with our longstanding rule that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be expressly and unequivocally stated in the text of the relevant statute.  It would be bizarre to create an &#x93;unequivocal statement&#x94; rule and then find that every Spending Clause enactment, no matter what its text, satisfies that rule because it includes unexpressed, implied remedies against the States.  The requirement of a clear statement in the text of the statute ensures that Congress has specifically considered state sovereign immunity and has intentionally legislated on the matter.  Cf.

Without such a clear statement from Congress and notice to the States, federal courts may not step in and abrogate state sovereign immunity.

				Sossamon also argues that &#xA7;1003 of the Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1986, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000d-7.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;2000d&#x96;7</a>, independently put the State on notice that it could be sued for damages under RLUIPA.  That provision expressly waives state sovereign immunity for violations of &#x93;section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
				<em>
					or the provisions of any other Federal statute prohibiting discrimination by recipients of Federal financial assistance
				</em>
				.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000d&#x96;7(a)(1) (emphasis added).  Section 1003 makes &#x93;remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) &#x2026; available for such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are available for such a violation in the suit against any public or private entity other than a State.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000d&#x96;7(a)(2).  Sossamon contends that &#xA7;3 of RLUIPA falls within the residual clause of &#xA7;1003 and therefore &#xA7;1003 waives Texas&#x92; sovereign immunity to RLUIPA suits for damages.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Even assuming that a residual clause like the one in &#xA7;1003 could constitute an unequivocal textual waiver, &#xA7;3 is not unequivocally a &#x93;statute prohibiting discrimination&#x94; within the meaning of &#xA7;1003.

				  The text of &#xA7;3 does not prohibit &#x93;discrimination&#x94;; rather, it prohibits &#x93;substantial burden[s]&#x94; on religious exercise.  This distinction is especially conspicuous in light of &#xA7;2 of RLUIPA, in which Congress expressly prohibited &#x93;land use regulation[s] that discriminat[e] &#x2026; on the basis of religion.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000cc(b)(2).  A waiver of sovereign immunity must be &#x93;strictly construed, in terms of its scope, in favor of the sovereign.&#x94;

The Court of Appeals subsequently held that Sossamon&#x92;s claim for injunctive relief with respect to the cell-restriction policy was moot because the State had abandoned that policy after Sossamon filed a prison grievance.  560 F. 3d 316, 326 (CA5 2009).  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court with respect to Sossamon&#x92;s chapel-use policy claim, id., at 331&#x96;335, although the Robertson Unit later amended that policy also and now permits inmates to attend scheduled worship services in the chapel subject to certain safety precautions.

						 Although Lane concerned the Federal Government, the strict construction principle, which flows logically from the requirement that consent be &#x93;unequivocally expressed,&#x94; applies to the sovereign immunity of the States as well.  Cf. United States v. Nordic Village, Inc.,

						 Nor can it be said that this Court&#x92;s use of the phrase &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; in Franklin and Barnes somehow put the States on notice that the same phrase in RLUIPA subjected them to suits for monetary relief.  Those cases did not involve sovereign defendants, so the Court had no occasion to consider sovereign immunity.  Liability against nonsovereigns could not put the States on notice that they would be liable in the same manner, absent an unequivocal textual waiver.  Moreover, the same phrase in RFRA had been interpreted not to include damages relief against the Federal Government or the States and so could have signaled to the States that damages are not &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; under RLUIPA.  See, e.g., Tinsley v. Pittari, 952 F. Supp. 384, 389 (ND Tex. 1996); Commack Self-Service Kosher Meats Inc. v. New York, 954 F. Supp. 65, 69 (EDNY 1997).

						 The dissent finds our decision &#x93;difficult to understand,&#x94; post, at 6 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.), but it follows naturally from this Court&#x92;s precedents regarding waiver of sovereign immunity, which the dissent gives astonishingly short shrift.  The dissent instead concerns itself primarily with &#x93;general remedies principles.&#x94;  Post, at 1.  The essence of sovereign immunity, however, is that remedies against the government differ from &#x93;general remedies principles&#x94; applicable to private litigants.  See, e.g., Lane v. Pe&#x144;a, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/518/187" class="subref" title="subref">518 U. S. 187</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">196</a> (1996)
 (calling it a &#x93;crucial point that, when it comes to an award of money damages, sovereign immunity places the &#x2026; Government on an entirely different footing than private parties&#x94;).

						 Sossamon argues that &#xA7;3 resembles &#xA7;504 of the Rehabilitation Act, one of the statutes listed in &#xA7;1003, because both require special accommodations for particular people or activities.  By Sossamon&#x92;s reasoning, every Spending Clause statute that arguably provides a benefit to a class of people or activities would become a federal statute &#x93;prohibiting discrimination,&#x94; thereby waiving sovereign immunity.  Such an interpretation cannot be squared with the foundational rule that waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed and strictly construed.

				Petitioner Harvey Leroy Sossamon III is an inmate in the Robertson Unit of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division.  In 2006, Sossamon sued the State of Texas and various prison officials in their official capacities under RLUIPA&#x92;s private cause of action, seeking injunctive and monetary relief.  Sossamon alleged that two prison policies violated RLUIPA: (1) a policy preventing inmates from attending religious services while on cell restriction for disciplinary infractions; and (2) a policy barring use of the prison chapel for religious worship.  The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of respondents and held, as relevant here, that sovereign immunity barred Sossamon&#x92;s claims for monetary relief.

				  Far from clearly identifying money damages, the word &#x93;appropriate&#x94; is inherently context-dependent.  See Webster&#x92;s Third New International Dictionary 106 (1993) (defining &#x93;appropriate&#x94; as &#x93;specially suitable:

The question was whether the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which has authority to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act against the Federal Government &#x93;through appropriate remedies,&#x94; could require the Federal Government to pay damages.

				Sossamon argues that, because RLUIPA expressly limits the United States to &#x93;injunctive or declaratory relief &#x94; to enforce the statute, the phrase &#x93;appropriate re-lief &#x94; in the private cause of action necessarily must be broader.  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-2.html#f" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;2(f)</a>.  Texas responds that, because the State has no immunity defense to a suit brought by the Federal Government, Congress needed to exclude damages affirmatively in that context but not in the context of private suits.  Further, the private cause of action provides that a person may assert a violation of the statute &#x93;as a claim 
				<em>
					or defense
				</em>
				.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;2(a) (emphasis added).
				<em>
					  
				</em>
				Because an injunction or declaratory judgment is not &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; for a successful defense, Texas explains, explicitly limiting the private cause of action to those forms of relief would make no sense.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Sossamon also emphasizes that the statute requires that it be &#x93;construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;3(g).  Texas responds that this provision is best read as addressing the substantive standards in the statute, not the scope of &#x93;appropriate relief.&#x94;  Texas also highlights Congress&#x92; choice of the word &#x93;relief,&#x94; which it argues primarily connotes equitable relief.  See Black&#x92;s Law Dictionary 1295 (7th ed. 1999) (defining &#x93;relief &#x94; as &#x93;[t]he redress or benefit, esp. equitable in nature &#x2026; , that a party asks of a court&#x94;).

				These plausible arguments demonstrate that the phrase &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; in RLUIPA is not so free from ambiguity that we may conclude that the States, by receiving federal funds, have unequivocally expressed intent to waive their sovereign immunity to suits for damages.

				Sossamon contends that, because Congress enacted &#xA7;3 of RLUIPA pursuant to the Spending Clause, the States were necessarily on notice that they would be liable for damages.  He argues that Spending Clause legislation operates as a contract and damages are always available relief for a breach of contract, whether the contract explicitly includes a damages remedy or not.  Relying on 
				<em>
					Barnes 
				</em>

				<em>

				In any event, applying ordinary contract principles here would make little sense because contracts with a sovereign are unique.  They do not traditionally confer a right of action for damages to enforce compliance: &#x93; &#x91;The contracts between a Nation and an individual are only binding on the conscience of the sovereign and have no pretensions to compulsive force.

				More fundamentally, Sossamon&#x92;s implied-contract-remedies proposal cannot be squared with our longstanding rule that a waiver of sovereign immunity must be expressly and unequivocally stated in the text of the relevant statute.  It would be bizarre to create an &#x93;unequivocal statement&#x94; rule and then find that every Spending Clause enactment, no matter what its text, satisfies that rule because it includes unexpressed, implied remedies against the States.  The requirement of a clear statement in the text of the statute ensures that Congress has specifically considered state sovereign immunity and has intentionally legislated on the matter.  Cf.

Section 1003 makes &#x93;remedies (including remedies both at law and in equity) &#x2026; available for such a violation to the same extent as such remedies are available for such a violation in the suit against any public or private entity other than a State.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000d&#x96;7(a)(2).  Sossamon contends that &#xA7;3 of RLUIPA falls within the residual clause of &#xA7;1003 and therefore &#xA7;1003 waives Texas&#x92; sovereign immunity to RLUIPA suits for damages.

				Even assuming that a residual clause like the one in &#xA7;1003 could constitute an unequivocal textual waiver, &#xA7;3 is not unequivocally a &#x93;statute prohibiting discrimination&#x94; within the meaning of &#xA7;1003.

				  The text of &#xA7;3 does not prohibit &#x93;discrimination&#x94;; rather, it prohibits &#x93;substantial burden[s]&#x94; on religious exercise.  This distinction is especially conspicuous in light of &#xA7;2 of RLUIPA, in which Congress expressly prohibited &#x93;land use regulation[s] that discriminat[e] &#x2026; on the basis of religion.&#x94;  &#xA7;2000cc(b)(2).

						 No party contends that the Commerce Clause permitted Congress to address the alleged burden on religious exercise at issue in this case.  See

						 The District Court also denied injunctive relief.  713 F. Supp. 2d 657, 668 (WD Tex. 2007).  The Court of Appeals subsequently held that Sossamon&#x92;s claim for injunctive relief with respect to the cell-restriction policy was moot because the State had abandoned that policy after Sossamon filed a prison grievance.  560 F. 3d 316, 326 (CA5 2009).  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court with respect to Sossamon&#x92;s chapel-use policy claim, id., at 331&#x96;335, although the Robertson Unit later amended that policy also and now permits inmates to attend scheduled worship services in the chapel subject to certain safety precautions.

						 Although Lane concerned the Federal Government, the strict construction principle, which flows logically from the requirement that consent be &#x93;unequivocally expressed,&#x94; applies to the sovereign immunity of the States as well.  Cf. United States v. Nordic Village, Inc.,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">37</a> (1992)
 (equating the &#x93;unequivocal expression&#x94; principle from &#x93;the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxi" class="subref" title="subref">Eleventh Amendment</a> context&#x94; with the principle applicable to federal sovereign immunity); College Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.,

						 Nor can it be said that this Court&#x92;s use of the phrase &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; in Franklin and Barnes somehow put the States on notice that the same phrase in RLUIPA subjected them to suits for monetary relief.  Those cases did not involve sovereign defendants, so the Court had no occasion to consider sovereign immunity.  Liability against nonsovereigns could not put the States on notice that they would be liable in the same manner, absent an unequivocal textual waiver.  Moreover, the same phrase in RFRA had been interpreted not to include damages relief against the Federal Government or the States and so could have signaled to the States that damages are not &#x93;appropriate relief &#x94; under RLUIPA.  See, e.g., Tinsley v. Pittari, 952 F. Supp. 384, 389 (ND Tex. 1996); Commack Self-Service Kosher Meats Inc. v. New York, 954 F. Supp. 65, 69 (EDNY 1997).

						 Of course, the Federal Government has, by statute, waived its sovereign immunity to damages for breach of contract in certain contexts.  See, e.g.,

						 The dissent finds our decision &#x93;difficult to understand,&#x94; post, at 6 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.), but it follows naturally from this Court&#x92;s precedents regarding waiver of sovereign immunity, which the dissent gives astonishingly short shrift.  The dissent instead concerns itself primarily with &#x93;general remedies principles.&#x94;  Post, at 1.  The essence of sovereign immunity, however, is that remedies against the government differ from &#x93;general remedies principles&#x94; applicable to private litigants.  See, e.g., Lane v. Pe&#x144;a, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/518/187" class="subref" title="subref">518 U. S. 187</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">196</a> (1996)
 (calling it a &#x93;crucial point that, when it comes to an award of money damages, sovereign immunity places the &#x2026; Government on an entirely different footing than private parties&#x94;).

						 Every Court of Appeals to consider the question has so held.  See Holley, 599 F. 3d, at 1113&#x96;1114; Van Wyhe, 581 F. 3d, at 654&#x96;655; Madison, 474 F. 3d, at 132&#x96;133.

						 Sossamon argues that &#xA7;3 resembles &#xA7;504 of the Rehabilitation Act, one of the statutes listed in &#xA7;1003, because both require special accommodations for particular people or activities.  By Sossamon&#x92;s reasoning, every Spending Clause statute that arguably provides a benefit to a class of people or activities would become a federal statute &#x93;prohibiting discrimination,&#x94; thereby waiving sovereign immunity.  Such an interpretation cannot be squared with the foundational rule that waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed and strictly construed.
