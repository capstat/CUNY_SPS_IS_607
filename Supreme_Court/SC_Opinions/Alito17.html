				The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has a two-step process for adjudicating veterans&#x92; benefits claims for service-connected disabilities: A VA regional office makes an initial decision on the claim; and a veteran dissatisfied with the decision may then seek 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 review in the Board of Veterans&#x92; Appeals.  Before 1988, a veteran whose claim was denied by the Board generally could not obtain further review, but the Veterans&#x92; Judicial Review Act (VJRA) created the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court), an Article I tribunal, to review Board decisions adverse to veterans.  A veteran must file a notice of appeal with that court within 120 days of the date when the Board&#x92;s final decision is properly mailed.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				
				    
				After the VA denied David Henderson&#x92;s claim for supplemental disability benefits, he filed a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court, missing the 120-day filing deadline by 15 days.  Henderson argued that his failure to timely file should be excused under equitable tolling principles.  While his appeal was pending, this Court decided 
				<em>
					Bowles
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Russell
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/551/205" class="subref" title="subref">551 U. S. 205</a>, which held that the statutory limitation on the length of an extension of time to file a notice of appeal in an ordinary civil case is &#x93;jurisdictional,&#x94; so that a party&#x92;s failure to file within that period could not be excused.  The Veterans Court concluded that 
				<em>
					Bowles
				</em>
				 compelled jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day deadline and dismissed Henderson&#x92;s untimely appeal.  The Federal Circuit affirmed.

				(a) Branding a procedural rule as going to a court&#x92;s subject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of the adversarial system.  Federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the scope of their subject-matter jurisdiction and thus must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press.  Jurisdictional rules may also cause a waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants, since objections may be raised at any time, even after trial.  Because of these drastic consequences, this Court has urged that a rule should not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court&#x92;s adjudicatory capacity, 
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction.

				(2) Several factors indicate that 120-day deadline was not meant to be jurisdictional.

Its placement in a subchapter entitled &#x93;Procedure,&#x94; and not in the subchapter entitled &#x93;Organization and Jurisdiction,&#x94; suggests that Congress regarded the 120-day limit as a claim-processing rule.  Most telling, however, are the singular characteristics of the review scheme that Congress created for adjudicating veterans&#x92; benefits claims.  Congress&#x92; longstanding solicitude for veterans,

				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/366/643" class="subref" title="subref">366 U. S. 643</a>, is plainly reflected in the VJRA and in subsequent laws that place a thumb on the scale in the veteran&#x92;s favor in the course of administrative and judicial review of VA decisions.  The contrast between ordinary civil litigation&#x97;which provided the context in 
				<em>
					Bowles&#x97;
				</em>
				and the system Congress created for veterans is dramatic.  In ordinary civil litigation suits must generally be commenced within a specified limitations period; the litigation is adversarial; plaintiffs must gather the evidence supporting their claims and generally bear the burden of production and persuasion; both parties may appeal an adverse decision; and a final judgment may be reopened only in narrow circumstances.  By contrast, a veteran need not file an initial benefits claim within any fixed period; the VA proceedings are informal and nonadversarial; and the VA assists veterans in developing their supporting evidence and must give them the benefit of any doubt in evaluating that evidence.  A veteran who loses before the Board may obtain review in the Veterans Court, but a Board decision in the veteran&#x92;s favor is final.  And a veteran may reopen a claim simply by presenting new and material evidence. Rigid jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period would clash sharply with this scheme.  Particularly in light of &#x93;the canon that provisions for benefits to members of the Armed Services are to be construed in the beneficiaries&#x92; favor,&#x94;

Contrary to the Government&#x92;s argument, the lack of review opportunities for veterans before 1988 is of little help in interpreting &#xA7;7266(a).  Section 7266(a) was enacted as part of the VJRA, and that legislation was decidedly favorable to veterans.  Pp. 8&#x96;12.

				A veteran whose claim for federal benefits is denied by the Board of Veterans&#x92; Appeals may appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court).  To do so, the veteran must file a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court within 120 days after the date when the Board&#x92;s final decision is properly mailed.

This case presents the question whether a veteran&#x92;s failure to file a notice of appeal within the 120-day period should be regarded as having &#x93;jurisdictional&#x94; consequences.  We hold that it should not.

				The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers the federal program that provides benefits to veterans with service-connected disabilities.  The VA has a two-step process for the adjudication of these claims.  First, a VA regional office receives and processes veterans&#x92; claims and makes an initial decision on whether to grant or deny benefits.  Second, if a veteran is dissatisfied with the regional office&#x92;s decision, the veteran may obtain 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 review by the Board of Veterans&#x92; Appeals.  The Board is a body within the VA that makes the agency&#x92;s final decision in cases appealed to it.  &#xA7;&#xA7;7101, 7104(a).

				David Henderson served in the military during the Korean War.  In 1992, the VA gave Henderson a 100-percent disability rating for paranoid schizophrenia, and in 2001, he filed a claim for supplemental benefits based on his need for in-home care.  After a VA regional office and the Board denied his claim, he filed a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court, but he missed the 120-day filing deadline by 15 days.  See &#xA7;7266(a).

				The Veterans Court initially dismissed Henderson&#x92;s appeal as untimely.

Later, the court granted Henderson&#x92;s motion for reconsideration, revoked the dismissal, and set the case for argument.  While Henderson&#x92;s appeal was pending, however, we decided

.  This question is not merely semantic but one of considerable practical importance for judges and litigants.  Branding a rule as going to a court&#x92;s subject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of our adversarial system.  Under that system, courts are generally limited to addressing the claims and arguments advanced by the parties.  See 
				<em>
					Sanchez-Llamas
				</em>

					Oregon

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">356</a>&#x96;357 (2006)
.  Courts do not usually raise claims or arguments on their own.  But federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the scope of their jurisdiction, and therefore they must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press.  See 
				<em>
					Arbaugh

				, 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 514.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Jurisdictional rules may also result in the waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants.  For purposes of efficiency and fairness, our legal system is replete with rules requiring that certain matters be raised at particular times.  See 
				<em>
					Sanchez-Llamas
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 356&#x96;357.  Objections to subject-matter jurisdiction, however, may be raised at any time.  Thus, a party, after losing at trial, may move to dismiss the case because the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.  
				<em>
					Arbaugh
				</em>
				, 546 U. S., at 508.  Indeed, a party may raise such an objection even if the party had previously acknowledged the trial court&#x92;s jurisdiction.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Because the consequences that attach to the jurisdictional label may be so drastic, we have tried in recent cases to bring some discipline to the use of this term.  We have urged that a rule should not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court&#x92;s adjudicatory capacity, that is, its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction.

				Among the types of rules that should not be described as jurisdictional are what we have called &#x93;claim-processing rules.&#x94;  These are rules that seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times.

				<em>

				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 455&#x96;456.  Filing deadlines, such as the 120-day filing deadline at issue here, are quintessential claim-processing rules.  Accordingly, if we were simply to apply the strict definition of jurisdiction that we have recommended in our recent cases, we would reverse the decision of the Federal Circuit, and this opinion could end at this point.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Unfortunately, the question before us is not quite that simple because Congress is free to attach the conditions that go with the jurisdictional label to a rule that we would prefer to call a claim-processing rule.  See 
				<em>
					Bowles
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 212&#x96;213.  The question here, therefore, is whether Congress mandated that the 120-day deadline be &#x93;jurisdictional.&#x94;  In 
				<em>
					Arbaugh
				</em>
				, we applied a &#x93;readily administrable bright line&#x94; rule for deciding such questions.  546 U. S., at 515&#x96;516.  Under 
				<em>
					Arbaugh
				</em>
				, we look to see if there is any &#x93;clear&#x94; indication that Congress wanted the rule to be &#x93;jurisdictional.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  This approach is suited to capture Congress&#x92; likely intent and also provides helpful guidance for courts and litigants, who will be &#x93;duly instructed&#x94; regarding a rule&#x92;s nature.  See

				In the end, however, none of the precedents cited by the parties controls our decision here.  All of those cases involved review by Article III courts.

If Congress had wanted the 120-day time to be treated as jurisdictional, it could have cast that provision in language like that in the provision of the VJRA that governs Federal Circuit review of decisions of the Veterans Court.

				The contrast between ordinary civil litigation&#x97;which provided the context of our decision in 
				<em>
					Bowles
				</em>
				&#x97;and the system that Congress created for the adjudication of veterans&#x92; benefits claims could hardly be more dramatic.  In ordinary civil litigation, plaintiffs must generally commence their suits within the time specified in a statute of limitations, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1658.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;1658</a>, and the litigation is adversarial.  Plaintiffs must gather the evidence that supports their claims and generally bear the burden of production and persuasion.  Both parties may appeal an adverse trial-court decision, see &#xA7;1291, and a final judgment may be reopened only in narrow circumstances.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By contrast, a veteran seeking benefits need not file an initial claim within any fixed period after the alleged onset of disability or separation from service.  When a claim is filed, proceedings before the VA are informal and nonadversarial.  The VA is charged with the responsibility of assisting veterans in developing evidence that supports their claims, and in evaluating that evidence, the VA must give the veteran the benefit of any doubt.  If a veteran is unsuccessful before a regional office, the veteran may obtain 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 review before the Board, and if the veteran loses before the Board, the veteran can obtain further review in the Veterans Court.  A Board decision in the veteran&#x92;s favor, on the other hand, is final.  And even if a veteran is denied benefits after exhausting all avenues of administrative and judicial review, a veteran may reopen a claim simply by presenting &#x93;new and material evidence.&#x94;  Rigid jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period for filing a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court would clash sharply with this scheme.

				The Government argues that there is no reason to think that jurisdictionally time-limited review is inconsistent with a pro-veteran administrative scheme because, prior to the enactment of the VJRA in 1988, VA decisions were not subject to any further review at all.  Brief for United States 29.  The provision at issue here, however, was enacted as part of the VJRA, and that legislation was decidedly favorable to veterans.  Accordingly, the review opportunities available to veterans before the VJRA was enacted are of little help in interpreting

				The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers the federal program that provides benefits to veterans with service-connected disabilities.  The VA has a two-step process for the adjudication of these claims.  First, a VA regional office receives and processes veterans&#x92; claims and makes an initial decision on whether to grant or deny benefits.  Second, if a veteran is dissatisfied with the regional office&#x92;s decision, the veteran may obtain 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 review by the Board of Veterans&#x92; Appeals.  The Board is a body within the VA that makes the agency&#x92;s final decision in cases appealed to it.  &#xA7;&#xA7;7101, 7104(a).

				David Henderson served in the military during the Korean War.  In 1992, the VA gave Henderson a 100-percent disability rating for paranoid schizophrenia, and in 2001, he filed a claim for supplemental benefits based on his need for in-home care.  After a VA regional office and the Board denied his claim, he filed a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court, but he missed the 120-day filing deadline by 15 days.  See &#xA7;7266(a).

				The Veterans Court initially dismissed Henderson&#x92;s appeal as untimely.  It concluded that Henderson was not entitled to equitable tolling of the deadline because he had not shown that his illness had caused his tardy filing.  Later, the court granted Henderson&#x92;s motion for reconsideration, revoked the dismissal, and set the case for argument.  While Henderson&#x92;s appeal was pending, however, we decided

.  This question is not merely semantic but one of considerable practical importance for judges and litigants.  Branding a rule as going to a court&#x92;s subject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of our adversarial system.  Under that system, courts are generally limited to addressing the claims and arguments advanced by the parties.  See

.  Courts do not usually raise claims or arguments on their own.  But federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the scope of their jurisdiction, and therefore they must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press.  See

				Jurisdictional rules may also result in the waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants.  For purposes of efficiency and fairness, our legal system is replete with rules requiring that certain matters be raised at particular times.  See 
				<em>
					Sanchez-Llamas
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 356&#x96;357.  Objections to subject-matter jurisdiction, however, may be raised at any time.  Thus, a party, after losing at trial, may move to dismiss the case because the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.

				Because the consequences that attach to the jurisdictional label may be so drastic, we have tried in recent cases to bring some discipline to the use of this term.  We have urged that a rule should not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court&#x92;s adjudicatory capacity, that is, its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction.

				Among the types of rules that should not be described as jurisdictional are what we have called &#x93;claim-processing rules.&#x94;  These are rules that seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times.

				Unfortunately, the question before us is not quite that simple because Congress is free to attach the conditions that go with the jurisdictional label to a rule that we would prefer to call a claim-processing rule.  See 
				<em>
					Bowles

				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 212&#x96;213.  The question here, therefore, is whether Congress mandated that the 120-day deadline be &#x93;jurisdictional.&#x94;  In 
				<em>

				<em>

				The contrast between ordinary civil litigation&#x97;which provided the context of our decision in 
				<em>
					Bowles
				</em>
				&#x97;and the system that Congress created for the adjudication of veterans&#x92; benefits claims could hardly be more dramatic.  In ordinary civil litigation, plaintiffs must generally commence their suits within the time specified in a statute of limitations, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1658.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;1658</a>, and the litigation is adversarial.  Plaintiffs must gather the evidence that supports their claims and generally bear the burden of production and persuasion.  Both parties may appeal an adverse trial-court decision, see &#xA7;1291, and a final judgment may be reopened only in narrow circumstances.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By contrast, a veteran seeking benefits need not file an initial claim within any fixed period after the alleged onset of disability or separation from service.  When a claim is filed, proceedings before the VA are informal and nonadversarial.  The VA is charged with the responsibility of assisting veterans in developing evidence that supports their claims, and in evaluating that evidence, the VA must give the veteran the benefit of any doubt.  If a veteran is unsuccessful before a regional office, the veteran may obtain 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 review before the Board, and if the veteran loses before the Board, the veteran can obtain further review in the Veterans Court.  A Board decision in the veteran&#x92;s favor, on the other hand, is final.  And even if a veteran is denied benefits after exhausting all avenues of administrative and judicial review, a veteran may reopen a claim simply by presenting &#x93;new and material evidence.&#x94;  Rigid jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period for filing a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court would clash sharply with this scheme.

				The Government argues that there is no reason to think that jurisdictionally time-limited review is inconsistent with a pro-veteran administrative scheme because, prior to the enactment of the VJRA in 1988, VA decisions were not subject to any further review at all.  Brief for United States 29.  The provision at issue here, however, was enacted as part of the VJRA, and that legislation was decidedly favorable to veterans.  Accordingly, the review opportunities available to veterans before the VJRA was enacted are of little help in interpreting

				A veteran whose claim for federal benefits is denied by the Board of Veterans&#x92; Appeals may appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court).  To do so, the veteran must file a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court within 120 days after the date when the Board&#x92;s final decision is properly mailed.

				The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers the federal program that provides benefits to veterans with service-connected disabilities.  The VA has a two-step process for the adjudication of these claims.  First, a VA regional office receives and processes veterans&#x92; claims and makes an initial decision on whether to grant or deny benefits.  Second, if a veteran is dissatisfied with the regional office&#x92;s decision, the veteran may obtain 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 review by the Board of Veterans&#x92; Appeals.  The Board is a body within the VA that makes the agency&#x92;s final decision in cases appealed to it.  &#xA7;&#xA7;7101, 7104(a).

				David Henderson served in the military during the Korean War.  In 1992, the VA gave Henderson a 100-percent disability rating for paranoid schizophrenia, and in 2001, he filed a claim for supplemental benefits based on his need for in-home care.  After a VA regional office and the Board denied his claim, he filed a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court, but he missed the 120-day filing deadline by 15 days.  See &#xA7;7266(a).

				The Veterans Court initially dismissed Henderson&#x92;s appeal as untimely.

.  This question is not merely semantic but one of considerable practical importance for judges and litigants.  Branding a rule as going to a court&#x92;s subject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of our adversarial system.  Under that system, courts are generally limited to addressing the claims and arguments advanced by the parties.  See 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">356</a>&#x96;357 (2006)
.  Courts do not usually raise claims or arguments on their own.  But federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the scope of their jurisdiction, and therefore they must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Jurisdictional rules may also result in the waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants.  For purposes of efficiency and fairness, our legal system is replete with rules requiring that certain matters be raised at particular times.  See 
				<em>
					Sanchez-Llamas
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 356&#x96;357.  Objections to subject-matter jurisdiction, however, may be raised at any time.  Thus, a party, after losing at trial, may move to dismiss the case because the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.

				Because the consequences that attach to the jurisdictional label may be so drastic, we have tried in recent cases to bring some discipline to the use of this term.  We have urged that a rule should not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court&#x92;s adjudicatory capacity, that is, its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction.

				Among the types of rules that should not be described as jurisdictional are what we have called &#x93;claim-processing rules.&#x94;  These are rules that seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times.

If Congress had wanted the 120-day time to be treated as jurisdictional, it could have cast that provision in language like that in the provision of the VJRA that governs Federal Circuit review of decisions of the Veterans Court.

				The contrast between ordinary civil litigation&#x97;which provided the context of our decision in 
				<em>
					Bowles
				</em>
				&#x97;and the system that Congress created for the adjudication of veterans&#x92; benefits claims could hardly be more dramatic.  In ordinary civil litigation, plaintiffs must generally commence their suits within the time specified in a statute of limitations, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1658.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;1658</a>, and the litigation is adversarial.  Plaintiffs must gather the evidence that supports their claims and generally bear the burden of production and persuasion.  Both parties may appeal an adverse trial-court decision, see &#xA7;1291, and a final judgment may be reopened only in narrow circumstances.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By contrast, a veteran seeking benefits need not file an initial claim within any fixed period after the alleged onset of disability or separation from service.  When a claim is filed, proceedings before the VA are informal and nonadversarial.  The VA is charged with the responsibility of assisting veterans in developing evidence that supports their claims, and in evaluating that evidence, the VA must give the veteran the benefit of any doubt.  If a veteran is unsuccessful before a regional office, the veteran may obtain 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 review before the Board, and if the veteran loses before the Board, the veteran can obtain further review in the Veterans Court.  A Board decision in the veteran&#x92;s favor, on the other hand, is final.  And even if a veteran is denied benefits after exhausting all avenues of administrative and judicial review, a veteran may reopen a claim simply by presenting &#x93;new and material evidence.&#x94;  Rigid jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period for filing a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court would clash sharply with this scheme.

				A veteran whose claim for federal benefits is denied by the Board of Veterans&#x92; Appeals may appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (Veterans Court).  To do so, the veteran must file a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court within 120 days after the date when the Board&#x92;s final decision is properly mailed.

This case presents the question whether a veteran&#x92;s failure to file a notice of appeal within the 120-day period should be regarded as having &#x93;jurisdictional&#x94; consequences.  We hold that it should not.

				The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers the federal program that provides benefits to veterans with service-connected disabilities.  The VA has a two-step process for the adjudication of these claims.  First, a VA regional office receives and processes veterans&#x92; claims and makes an initial decision on whether to grant or deny benefits.  Second, if a veteran is dissatisfied with the regional office&#x92;s decision, the veteran may obtain 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 review by the Board of Veterans&#x92; Appeals.  The Board is a body within the VA that makes the agency&#x92;s final decision in cases appealed to it.  &#xA7;&#xA7;7101, 7104(a).

				David Henderson served in the military during the Korean War.  In 1992, the VA gave Henderson a 100-percent disability rating for paranoid schizophrenia, and in 2001, he filed a claim for supplemental benefits based on his need for in-home care.  After a VA regional office and the Board denied his claim, he filed a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court, but he missed the 120-day filing deadline by 15 days.  See &#xA7;7266(a).

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Veterans Court initially dismissed Henderson&#x92;s appeal as untimely.  It concluded that Henderson was not entitled to equitable tolling of the deadline because he had not shown that his illness had caused his tardy filing.  Later, the court granted Henderson&#x92;s motion for reconsideration, revoked the dismissal, and set the case for argument.  While Henderson&#x92;s appeal was pending, however, we decided

.  This question is not merely semantic but one of considerable practical importance for judges and litigants.  Branding a rule as going to a court&#x92;s subject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of our adversarial system.  Under that system, courts are generally limited to addressing the claims and arguments advanced by the parties.  See 
				<em>
					Sanchez-Llamas
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Oregon
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/548/331" class="subref" title="subref">548 U. S. 331</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">356</a>&#x96;357 (2006)
.  Courts do not usually raise claims or arguments on their own.  But federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the scope of their jurisdiction, and therefore they must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press.  See 
				<em>
					Arbaugh
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 514.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Jurisdictional rules may also result in the waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants.  For purposes of efficiency and fairness, our legal system is replete with rules requiring that certain matters be raised at particular times.  See 
				<em>
					Sanchez-Llamas
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 356&#x96;357.  Objections to subject-matter jurisdiction, however, may be raised at any time.  Thus, a party, after losing at trial, may move to dismiss the case because the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.  
				<em>
					Arbaugh
				</em>
				, 546 U. S., at 508.  Indeed, a party may raise such an objection even if the party had previously acknowledged the trial court&#x92;s jurisdiction.

				  And if the trial court lacked jurisdiction, many months of work on the part of the attorneys and the court may be wasted.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Because the consequences that attach to the jurisdictional label may be so drastic, we have tried in recent cases to bring some discipline to the use of this term.  We have urged that a rule should not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court&#x92;s adjudicatory capacity, that is, its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction.

				</em>
				, 558 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Among the types of rules that should not be described as jurisdictional are what we have called &#x93;claim-processing rules.&#x94;  These are rules that seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times.  
				<em>

				<em>
					Kontrick
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 455&#x96;456.  Filing deadlines, such as the 120-day filing deadline at issue here, are quintessential claim-processing rules.  Accordingly, if we were simply to apply the strict definition of jurisdiction that we have recommended in our recent cases, we would reverse the decision of the Federal Circuit, and this opinion could end at this point.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Unfortunately, the question before us is not quite that simple because Congress is free to attach the conditions that go with the jurisdictional label to a rule that we would prefer to call a claim-processing rule.  See 
				<em>
					Bowles
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 212&#x96;213.  The question here, therefore, is whether Congress mandated that the 120-day deadline be &#x93;jurisdictional.&#x94;  In 
				<em>
					Arbaugh
				</em>
				, we applied a &#x93;readily administrable bright line&#x94; rule for deciding such questions.  546 U. S., at 515&#x96;516.  Under 
				<em>
					Arbaugh
				</em>
				, we look to see if there is any &#x93;clear&#x94; indication that Congress wanted the rule to be &#x93;jurisdictional.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  This approach is suited to capture Congress&#x92; likely intent and also provides helpful guidance for courts and litigants, who will be &#x93;duly instructed&#x94; regarding a rule&#x92;s nature.  See

Instead of applying a categorical rule regarding review of administrative decisions, we attempt to ascertain Congress&#x92; intent regarding the particular type of review at issue in this case.

If Congress had wanted the 120-day time to be treated as jurisdictional, it could have cast that provision in language like that in the provision of the VJRA that governs Federal Circuit review of decisions of the Veterans Court.  This latter provision states that Federal Circuit review must be obtained &#x93;within the time and in the manner prescribed for appeal to United States courts of appeals from United States district courts.&#x94;  &#xA7;7292(a).

				The contrast between ordinary civil litigation&#x97;which provided the context of our decision in 
				<em>
					Bowles
				</em>
				&#x97;and the system that Congress created for the adjudication of veterans&#x92; benefits claims could hardly be more dramatic.  In ordinary civil litigation, plaintiffs must generally commence their suits within the time specified in a statute of limitations, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1658.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;1658</a>, and the litigation is adversarial.  Plaintiffs must gather the evidence that supports their claims and generally bear the burden of production and persuasion.  Both parties may appeal an adverse trial-court decision, see &#xA7;1291, and a final judgment may be reopened only in narrow circumstances.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By contrast, a veteran seeking benefits need not file an initial claim within any fixed period after the alleged onset of disability or separation from service.  When a claim is filed, proceedings before the VA are informal and nonadversarial.  The VA is charged with the responsibility of assisting veterans in developing evidence that supports their claims, and in evaluating that evidence, the VA must give the veteran the benefit of any doubt.  If a veteran is unsuccessful before a regional office, the veteran may obtain 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 review before the Board, and if the veteran loses before the Board, the veteran can obtain further review in the Veterans Court.  A Board decision in the veteran&#x92;s favor, on the other hand, is final.  And even if a veteran is denied benefits after exhausting all avenues of administrative and judicial review, a veteran may reopen a claim simply by presenting &#x93;new and material evidence.&#x94;  Rigid jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period for filing a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court would clash sharply with this scheme.

				The Government argues that there is no reason to think that jurisdictionally time-limited review is inconsistent with a pro-veteran administrative scheme because, prior to the enactment of the VJRA in 1988, VA decisions were not subject to any further review at all.  Brief for United States 29.  The provision at issue here, however, was enacted as part of the VJRA, and that legislation was decidedly favorable to veterans.  Accordingly, the review opportunities available to veterans before the VJRA was enacted are of little help in interpreting

				The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administers the federal program that provides benefits to veterans with service-connected disabilities.  The VA has a two-step process for the adjudication of these claims.  First, a VA regional office receives and processes veterans&#x92; claims and makes an initial decision on whether to grant or deny benefits.  Second, if a veteran is dissatisfied with the regional office&#x92;s decision, the veteran may obtain 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 review by the Board of Veterans&#x92; Appeals.  The Board is a body within the VA that makes the agency&#x92;s final decision in cases appealed to it.  &#xA7;&#xA7;7101, 7104(a).

				David Henderson served in the military during the Korean War.  In 1992, the VA gave Henderson a 100-percent disability rating for paranoid schizophrenia, and in 2001, he filed a claim for supplemental benefits based on his need for in-home care.  After a VA regional office and the Board denied his claim, he filed a notice of appeal with the Veterans Court, but he missed the 120-day filing deadline by 15 days.  See &#xA7;7266(a).

.  This question is not merely semantic but one of considerable practical importance for judges and litigants.  Branding a rule as going to a court&#x92;s subject-matter jurisdiction alters the normal operation of our adversarial system.  Under that system, courts are generally limited to addressing the claims and arguments advanced by the parties.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">356</a>&#x96;357 (2006)
.  Courts do not usually raise claims or arguments on their own.  But federal courts have an independent obligation to ensure that they do not exceed the scope of their jurisdiction, and therefore they must raise and decide jurisdictional questions that the parties either overlook or elect not to press.

				Jurisdictional rules may also result in the waste of judicial resources and may unfairly prejudice litigants.  For purposes of efficiency and fairness, our legal system is replete with rules requiring that certain matters be raised at particular times.  See 
				<em>
					Sanchez-Llamas
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 356&#x96;357.  Objections to subject-matter jurisdiction, however, may be raised at any time.  Thus, a party, after losing at trial, may move to dismiss the case because the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.

				Because the consequences that attach to the jurisdictional label may be so drastic, we have tried in recent cases to bring some discipline to the use of this term.  We have urged that a rule should not be referred to as jurisdictional unless it governs a court&#x92;s adjudicatory capacity, that is, its subject-matter or personal jurisdiction.

				Among the types of rules that should not be described as jurisdictional are what we have called &#x93;claim-processing rules.&#x94;  These are rules that seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation by requiring that the parties take certain procedural steps at certain specified times.

If Congress had wanted the 120-day time to be treated as jurisdictional, it could have cast that provision in language like that in the provision of the VJRA that governs Federal Circuit review of decisions of the Veterans Court.

				The contrast between ordinary civil litigation&#x97;which provided the context of our decision in 
				<em>
					Bowles
				</em>
				&#x97;and the system that Congress created for the adjudication of veterans&#x92; benefits claims could hardly be more dramatic.  In ordinary civil litigation, plaintiffs must generally commence their suits within the time specified in a statute of limitations, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1658.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;1658</a>, and the litigation is adversarial.  Plaintiffs must gather the evidence that supports their claims and generally bear the burden of production and persuasion.  Both parties may appeal an adverse trial-court decision, see &#xA7;1291, and a final judgment may be reopened only in narrow circumstances.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 60.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				By contrast, a veteran seeking benefits need not file an initial claim within any fixed period after the alleged onset of disability or separation from service.  When a claim is filed, proceedings before the VA are informal and nonadversarial.  The VA is charged with the responsibility of assisting veterans in developing evidence that supports their claims, and in evaluating that evidence, the VA must give the veteran the benefit of any doubt.  If a veteran is unsuccessful before a regional office, the veteran may obtain 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 review before the Board, and if the veteran loses before the Board, the veteran can obtain further review in the Veterans Court.  A Board decision in the veteran&#x92;s favor, on the other hand, is final.  And even if a veteran is denied benefits after exhausting all avenues of administrative and judicial review, a veteran may reopen a claim simply by presenting &#x93;new and material evidence.&#x94;  Rigid jurisdictional treatment of the 120-day period for filing a notice of appeal in the Veterans Court would clash sharply with this scheme.
