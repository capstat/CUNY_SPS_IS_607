				A grand jury in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana, indicted petitioner Campbell for second-degree murder.  In light of evidence that, for the prior 16 &#xBD; years, no black person had served as grand jury foreperson in the Parish even though more than 20 percent of the registered voters were black, Campbell filed a motion to quash the indictment on the ground that his grand jury was constituted in violation of his 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> equal protection and due process rights and the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>&#x92;s fair-cross-section requirement.  The trial judge denied the motion because Campbell, a white man accused of killing another white man, lacked standing to complain about the exclusion of black persons from serving as forepersons.  He was convicted, but the Louisiana Court of Appeal ordered an evidentiary hearing, holding that Campbell could object to the alleged discrimination under the holding in

S. 400</a>, that a white defendant had standing to challenge racial discrimination against black persons in the use of peremptory challenges.  In reversing, the State Supreme Court declined to extend 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				 to a claim such as Campbell&#x92;s.  It also found that he was not afforded standing to raise a due process objection by

				(a) This case must be treated as one alleging discriminatory selection of grand jurors, not just of a grand jury foreperson.  In the federal system and in most States using grand juries, the foreperson is selected from the ranks of the already seated jurors.  In Louisiana, by contrast, the judge selects the foreperson from the grand jury venire before the remaining members are chosen by lot.  In addition to his other duties, the Louisiana foreperson has the same full voting powers as other grand jury members.  As a result, when the Louisiana judge selected the foreperson, he also selected one member of the grand jury outside of the drawing system used to compose the balance of that body.  Pp. 3&#x96;4.

				<em>
					.
				</em>
				  The excluded jurors&#x92; own right not to be discriminatorily denied grand jury service can be asserted by Campbell because he satisfies the three preconditions for third-party standing outlined in 
				<em>
					Powers, supra,
				</em>
				 at 411.  First, regardless of skin color, an accused suffers a significant &#x93;injury in fact&#x94; when the grand jury&#x92;s composition is tainted by racial discrimination.  The integrity of the body&#x92;s decisions depends on the integrity of the process used to select the grand jurors.  If that process is infected with racial discrimination, doubt is cast over the fairness of all subsequent decisions.  See 
				<em>
					Rose
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Mitchell,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/433/545" class="subref" title="subref">433 U. S. 545</a>.  The Court rejects the State&#x92;s argument that no harm is inflicted when a single grand juror is selected based on racial prejudice because the discrimination is invisible to the grand jurors on that panel, and only becomes apparent when a pattern emerges over the course of years.  This argument underestimates the seriousness of the allegations here: If they are true, the impartiality and discretion of the judge himself would be called into question.  Second, Campbell has a &#x93;close relationship&#x94; to the excluded jurors, who share with him a common interest in eradicating discrimination from the grand jury selection process, and a vital interest in asserting their rights because his conviction may be overturned as a result.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Powers
				</em>
				, 499 U. S., at 413&#x96;414.  The State&#x92;s argument that Campbell has but a tenuous connection to jurors excluded in the past confuses his underlying claim&#x97;that black persons were excluded from his grand jury&#x97;with the evidence needed to prove it&#x97;that similarly situated venirepersons were excluded in previous cases on account of intentional discrimination.  Third, given the economic burdens of litigation and the small financial reward available, a grand juror excluded because of race has little incentive to sue to vindicate his own rights.  See

				(c) A white defendant alleging discriminatory selection of grand jurors has standing to litigate whether his conviction was procured by means or procedures which contravene due process.  
				<em>

				 as foreclosing Campbell&#x92;s standing is inconsistent with that implicit assumption and with the Court&#x92;s explicit reasoning in 
				<em>
					Hobby
				</em>
				.  Campbell&#x92;s challenge is different in kind and degree from the one there at issue because it implicates the impermissible appointment of a member of the grand jury.  What concerns Campbell is not the foreperson&#x92;s performance of his ministerial duty to preside, but his performance as a grand juror, namely voting to charge Campbell with second-degree murder.  The significance of this distinction was acknowledged in 
				<em>

				A grand jury in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana, indicted petitioner Terry Campbell on one count of second-degree murder.  Campbell, who is white, filed a timely pretrial motion to quash the indictment on the grounds the grand jury was constituted in violation of his equal protection and due process rights under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> and in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>&#x92;s fair-cross-section requirement.  Campbell alleged a longstanding practice of racial discrimination in the selection of grand jury forepersons in the Parish.  His sole piece of evidence is that, between January 1976 and August 1993, no black person served as a grand jury foreperson in the Parish, even though more than 20 percent of the registered voters were black persons.  See Brief for Petitioner 16.  The State does not dispute this evidence.  The trial judge refused to quash the indictment because &#x93;Campbell, being a white man accused of killing another white man,&#x94; lacked standing to complain &#x93;where all of the forepersons were white.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert. G&#x96;33.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				After Campbell&#x92;s first trial resulted in a mistrial, he was retried, convicted of second-degree murder, and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.  Campbell renewed his challenge to the grand jury foreperson selection procedures in a motion for new trial, which was denied.  See

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/499/400" class="subref" title="subref">499 U. S. 400</a> (1991)
, Campbell had standing to object to the alleged discrimination even though he is white.  651 So. 2d 412 (1995).  The Court of Appeal remanded the case for an evidentiary hearing because it found Campbell&#x92;s evidence of discrimination inadequate.

				The Louisiana Supreme Court reversed.  It distinguished 
				<em>

				</em>
				 as turning on the &#x93;considerable and substantial impact&#x94; that a prosecutor&#x92;s discriminatory use of peremptory challenges has on a defendant&#x92;s trial as well as on the integrity of the judicial system.  See 661 So. 2d 1321, 1324 (1995).  The court declined to extend

				<em>
					Hobby
				</em>
				, this Court held no relief could be granted to a white defendant even if his due process rights were violated by discrimination in the selection of a federal grand jury foreperson.  Noting that 
				<em>
					Hobby
				</em>
				 turned on the ministerial nature of the federal grand jury foreperson&#x92;s duties, the Louisiana Supreme Court held &#x93;[t]he role of the grand jury foreman in Louisiana appears to be similarly ministerial&#x94; such that any discrimination &#x93;has little, if any, effect on the defendant&#x92;s due process right of fundamental fairness.&#x94;  661 So. 2d, at 1324.  Because the Court of Appeal had not addressed Campbell&#x92;s other asserted points of error, the Louisiana Supreme Court remanded the case.  After the Court of Appeal rejected Campbell&#x92;s remaining claims, the Louisiana Supreme Court refused to reconsider its ruling on the grand jury issue.  See 685 So. 2d 140 (1997).  We granted certiorari to address the narrow question of Campbell&#x92;s standing to raise equal protection, due process, and fair-cross-section claims.  521 U. S. __ (1997).

				As an initial matter, we note Campbell complains about more than discrimination in the selection of his grand jury foreperson; he alleges that discrimination shaped the composition of the grand jury itself.  In the federal system and in most States which use grand juries, the foreperson is selected from the ranks of the already seated grand jurors.  See 1 S. Beale, W. Bryson, J. Felman &amp; M. Elston, Grand Jury Law and Practice &#xA7;4:6, p. 4&#x96;20 to 4&#x96;21 (2d ed. 1997) (either the judge selects the foreperson or fellow grand jurors elect him or her).  Under those systems, the title &#x93;foreperson&#x94; is bestowed on one of the existing grand jurors without any change in the grand jury&#x92;s composition.  In Louisiana, by contrast, the judge selects the foreperson from the grand jury venire before the remaining members of the grand jury have been chosen by lot.  La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 413(B) (West Supp. 1997); see also Beale, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;22, n. 11 (Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia use procedures similar to Louisiana&#x92;s).  In addition to his other duties, the foreperson of the Louisiana grand jury has the same full voting powers as other grand jury members.  As a result, when the Louisiana judge selected the foreperson, he also selected one member of the grand jury outside of the drawing system used to compose the balance of that body.  These considerations require us to treat the case as one alleging discriminatory selection of grand jurors.

				In 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Ohio
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, we found a white defendant had standing to challenge racial discrimination against black persons in the use of peremptory challenges.  We determined the defendant himself could raise the equal protection rights of the excluded jurors.  Recognizing our general reluctance to permit a litigant to assert the rights of a third party, we found three preconditions had been satisfied: (1) the defendant suffered an &#x93;injury in fact&#x94;; (2) he had a &#x93;close relationship&#x94; to the excluded jurors; and (3) there was some hindrance to the excluded jurors asserting their own rights.

).  We concluded a white defendant suffers a serious injury in fact because discrimination at the 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Although Campbell challenges discriminatory selection of grand jurors, rather than petit jurors, 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				&#x92; reasoning applies to this case on the question of standing.  Our prior cases have not decided whether a white defendant&#x92;s own equal protection rights are violated when the composition of his grand jury is tainted by discrimination against black persons.  We do not need to address this issue because Campbell seeks to assert the well-established equal protection rights of black persons not to be excluded from grand jury service on the basis of their race.

				 emphasized the harm inflicted when a prosecutor discriminates by striking racial minorities in open court and in front of the entire jury pool.  The Court expressed concern that this tactic might encourage the jury to be lawless in its own actions. See 499 U. S., at 412&#x96;413.  The State suggests this sort of harm is not inflicted when a single grand juror is selected based on racial prejudice because the discrimination is invisible to the grand jurors on that panel; it only becomes apparent when a pattern emerges over the course of years.  See Brief for Respondent 16.  This argument, however, underestimates the seriousness of the allegations.  In 
				<em>

				, even if the prosecutor had been motivated by racial prejudice, those responsible for the defendant&#x92;s fate, the judge and the jury, had shown no actual bias.

This argument confuses Campbell&#x92;s underlying claim with the evidence needed to prove it.  To assert the rights of those venirepersons who were excluded from serving on the grand jury in his case, Campbell must prove their exclusion was on account of intentional discrimination.  He seeks to do so based on past treatment of similarly situated venirepersons in other cases, see

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">494</a> (1977)
, but this does not mean he seeks to assert those venirepersons&#x92; rights.  As a final matter, excluded grand jurors have the same economic disincentives to assert their own rights as do excluded petit jurors.  See 
				<em>

				 is inconsistent with the implicit assumption of standing we have just noted and with our explicit reasoning in that case.  In 
				<em>

				A grand jury in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana, indicted petitioner Terry Campbell on one count of second-degree murder.  Campbell, who is white, filed a timely pretrial motion to quash the indictment on the grounds the grand jury was constituted in violation of his equal protection and due process rights under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> and in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>&#x92;s fair-cross-section requirement.  Campbell alleged a longstanding practice of racial discrimination in the selection of grand jury forepersons in the Parish.  His sole piece of evidence is that, between January 1976 and August 1993, no black person served as a grand jury foreperson in the Parish, even though more than 20 percent of the registered voters were black persons.  See Brief for Petitioner 16.  The State does not dispute this evidence.  The trial judge refused to quash the indictment because &#x93;Campbell, being a white man accused of killing another white man,&#x94; lacked standing to complain &#x93;where all of the forepersons were white.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert.

				 turned on the ministerial nature of the federal grand jury foreperson&#x92;s duties, the Louisiana Supreme Court held &#x93;[t]he role of the grand jury foreman in Louisiana appears to be similarly ministerial&#x94; such that any discrimination &#x93;has little, if any, effect on the defendant&#x92;s due process right of fundamental fairness.&#x94;  661 So. 2d, at 1324.  Because the Court of Appeal had not addressed Campbell&#x92;s other asserted points of error, the Louisiana Supreme Court remanded the case.  After the Court of Appeal rejected Campbell&#x92;s remaining claims, the Louisiana Supreme Court refused to reconsider its ruling on the grand jury issue.  See 685 So. 2d 140 (1997).  We granted certiorari to address the narrow question of Campbell&#x92;s standing to raise equal protection, due process, and fair-cross-section claims.  521 U. S. __ (1997).

				As an initial matter, we note Campbell complains about more than discrimination in the selection of his grand jury foreperson; he alleges that discrimination shaped the composition of the grand jury itself.  In the federal system and in most States which use grand juries, the foreperson is selected from the ranks of the already seated grand jurors.  See 1 S. Beale, W. Bryson, J. Felman &amp; M. Elston, Grand Jury Law and Practice &#xA7;4:6, p. 4&#x96;20 to 4&#x96;21 (2d ed. 1997) (either the judge selects the foreperson or fellow grand jurors elect him or her).  Under those systems, the title &#x93;foreperson&#x94; is bestowed on one of the existing grand jurors without any change in the grand jury&#x92;s composition.  In Louisiana, by contrast, the judge selects the foreperson from the grand jury venire before the remaining members of the grand jury have been chosen by lot.  La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 413(B) (West Supp. 1997); see also Beale, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;22, n. 11 (Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia use procedures similar to Louisiana&#x92;s).  In addition to his other duties, the foreperson of the Louisiana grand jury has the same full voting powers as other grand jury members.  As a result, when the Louisiana judge selected the foreperson, he also selected one member of the grand jury outside of the drawing system used to compose the balance of that body.  These considerations require us to treat the case as one alleging discriminatory selection of grand jurors.

				In 
				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>
					Ohio
				</em>
				, 
				<em>

				, we found a white defendant had standing to challenge racial discrimination against black persons in the use of peremptory challenges.  We determined the defendant himself could raise the equal protection rights of the excluded jurors.  Recognizing our general reluctance to permit a litigant to assert the rights of a third party, we found three preconditions had been satisfied: (1) the defendant suffered an &#x93;injury in fact&#x94;; (2) he had a &#x93;close relationship&#x94; to the excluded jurors; and (3) there was some hindrance to the excluded jurors asserting their own rights.

				<em>

				Although Campbell challenges discriminatory selection of grand jurors, rather than petit jurors, 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				&#x92; reasoning applies to this case on the question of standing.  Our prior cases have not decided whether a white defendant&#x92;s own equal protection rights are violated when the composition of his grand jury is tainted by discrimination against black persons.  We do not need to address this issue because Campbell seeks to assert the well-established equal protection rights of black persons not to be excluded from grand jury service on the basis of their race.

				 emphasized the harm inflicted when a prosecutor discriminates by striking racial minorities in open court and in front of the entire jury pool.  The Court expressed concern that this tactic might encourage the jury to be lawless in its own actions. See 499 U. S., at 412&#x96;413.  The State suggests this sort of harm is not inflicted when a single grand juror is selected based on racial prejudice because the discrimination is invisible to the grand jurors on that panel; it only becomes apparent when a pattern emerges over the course of years.  See Brief for Respondent 16.  This argument, however, underestimates the seriousness of the allegations.  In 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				, even if the prosecutor had been motivated by racial prejudice, those responsible for the defendant&#x92;s fate, the judge and the jury, had shown no actual bias.  If, by contrast, the allegations here are true, the impartiality and discretion of the judge himself would be called into question.

This argument confuses Campbell&#x92;s underlying claim with the evidence needed to prove it.  To assert the rights of those venirepersons who were excluded from serving on the grand jury in his case, Campbell must prove their exclusion was on account of intentional discrimination.  He seeks to do so based on past treatment of similarly situated venirepersons in other cases, see

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">494</a> (1977)

				The Louisiana Supreme Court was wrong on both counts.  Its interpretation of

				 is inconsistent with the implicit assumption of standing we have just noted and with our explicit reasoning in that case.  In

				, at __.  Against this background, the Court rejected the defendant&#x92;s claim because the ministerial role of a federal grand jury foreperson &#x93;is not such a vital one that discrimination in the appointment of an individual to that post significantly invades&#x94; due process.

				A grand jury in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana, indicted petitioner Terry Campbell on one count of second-degree murder.  Campbell, who is white, filed a timely pretrial motion to quash the indictment on the grounds the grand jury was constituted in violation of his equal protection and due process rights under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> and in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>&#x92;s fair-cross-section requirement.  Campbell alleged a longstanding practice of racial discrimination in the selection of grand jury forepersons in the Parish.  His sole piece of evidence is that, between January 1976 and August 1993, no black person served as a grand jury foreperson in the Parish, even though more than 20 percent of the registered voters were black persons.  See Brief for Petitioner 16.  The State does not dispute this evidence.  The trial judge refused to quash the indictment because &#x93;Campbell, being a white man accused of killing another white man,&#x94; lacked standing to complain &#x93;where all of the forepersons were white.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert.

Because the Court of Appeal had not addressed Campbell&#x92;s other asserted points of error, the Louisiana Supreme Court remanded the case.  After the Court of Appeal rejected Campbell&#x92;s remaining claims, the Louisiana Supreme Court refused to reconsider its ruling on the grand jury issue.  See 685 So. 2d 140 (1997).  We granted certiorari to address the narrow question of Campbell&#x92;s standing to raise equal protection, due process, and fair-cross-section claims.  521 U. S. __ (1997).

				As an initial matter, we note Campbell complains about more than discrimination in the selection of his grand jury foreperson; he alleges that discrimination shaped the composition of the grand jury itself.  In the federal system and in most States which use grand juries, the foreperson is selected from the ranks of the already seated grand jurors.  See 1 S. Beale, W. Bryson, J. Felman &amp; M. Elston, Grand Jury Law and Practice &#xA7;4:6, p. 4&#x96;20 to 4&#x96;21 (2d ed. 1997) (either the judge selects the foreperson or fellow grand jurors elect him or her).  Under those systems, the title &#x93;foreperson&#x94; is bestowed on one of the existing grand jurors without any change in the grand jury&#x92;s composition.  In Louisiana, by contrast, the judge selects the foreperson from the grand jury venire before the remaining members of the grand jury have been chosen by lot.  La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 413(B) (West Supp. 1997); see also Beale, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;22, n. 11 (Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia use procedures similar to Louisiana&#x92;s).  In addition to his other duties, the foreperson of the Louisiana grand jury has the same full voting powers as other grand jury members.  As a result, when the Louisiana judge selected the foreperson, he also selected one member of the grand jury outside of the drawing system used to compose the balance of that body.  These considerations require us to treat the case as one alleging discriminatory selection of grand jurors.

				In

				, we found a white defendant had standing to challenge racial discrimination against black persons in the use of peremptory challenges.  We determined the defendant himself could raise the equal protection rights of the excluded jurors.  Recognizing our general reluctance to permit a litigant to assert the rights of a third party, we found three preconditions had been satisfied: (1) the defendant suffered an &#x93;injury in fact&#x94;; (2) he had a &#x93;close relationship&#x94; to the excluded jurors; and (3) there was some hindrance to the excluded jurors asserting their own rights.

				Although Campbell challenges discriminatory selection of grand jurors, rather than petit jurors, 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				&#x92; reasoning applies to this case on the question of standing.  Our prior cases have not decided whether a white defendant&#x92;s own equal protection rights are violated when the composition of his grand jury is tainted by discrimination against black persons.  We do not need to address this issue because Campbell seeks to assert the well-established equal protection rights of black persons not to be excluded from grand jury service on the basis of their race.

The Court expressed concern that this tactic might encourage the jury to be lawless in its own actions. See 499 U. S., at 412&#x96;413.  The State suggests this sort of harm is not inflicted when a single grand juror is selected based on racial prejudice because the discrimination is invisible to the grand jurors on that panel; it only becomes apparent when a pattern emerges over the course of years.  See Brief for Respondent 16.  This argument, however, underestimates the seriousness of the allegations.  In 
				<em>
					Powers

				, even if the prosecutor had been motivated by racial prejudice, those responsible for the defendant&#x92;s fate, the judge and the jury, had shown no actual bias.

This argument confuses Campbell&#x92;s underlying claim with the evidence needed to prove it.  To assert the rights of those venirepersons who were excluded from serving on the grand jury in his case, Campbell must prove their exclusion was on account of intentional discrimination.  He seeks to do so based on past treatment of similarly situated venirepersons in other cases, see

				A grand jury in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana, indicted petitioner Terry Campbell on one count of second-degree murder.  Campbell, who is white, filed a timely pretrial motion to quash the indictment on the grounds the grand jury was constituted in violation of his equal protection and due process rights under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> and in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>&#x92;s fair-cross-section requirement.  Campbell alleged a longstanding practice of racial discrimination in the selection of grand jury forepersons in the Parish.  His sole piece of evidence is that, between January 1976 and August 1993, no black person served as a grand jury foreperson in the Parish, even though more than 20 percent of the registered voters were black persons.  See Brief for Petitioner 16.  The State does not dispute this evidence.  The trial judge refused to quash the indictment because &#x93;Campbell, being a white man accused of killing another white man,&#x94; lacked standing to complain &#x93;where all of the forepersons were white.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert.

Because the Court of Appeal had not addressed Campbell&#x92;s other asserted points of error, the Louisiana Supreme Court remanded the case.  After the Court of Appeal rejected Campbell&#x92;s remaining claims, the Louisiana Supreme Court refused to reconsider its ruling on the grand jury issue.  See 685 So. 2d 140 (1997).

				As an initial matter, we note Campbell complains about more than discrimination in the selection of his grand jury foreperson; he alleges that discrimination shaped the composition of the grand jury itself.  In the federal system and in most States which use grand juries, the foreperson is selected from the ranks of the already seated grand jurors.  See 1 S. Beale, W. Bryson, J. Felman &amp; M. Elston, Grand Jury Law and Practice &#xA7;4:6, p. 4&#x96;20 to 4&#x96;21 (2d ed. 1997) (either the judge selects the foreperson or fellow grand jurors elect him or her).  Under those systems, the title &#x93;foreperson&#x94; is bestowed on one of the existing grand jurors without any change in the grand jury&#x92;s composition.  In Louisiana, by contrast, the judge selects the foreperson from the grand jury venire before the remaining members of the grand jury have been chosen by lot.  La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 413(B) (West Supp. 1997); see also Beale, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;22, n. 11 (Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia use procedures similar to Louisiana&#x92;s).  In addition to his other duties, the foreperson of the Louisiana grand jury has the same full voting powers as other grand jury members.  As a result, when the Louisiana judge selected the foreperson, he also selected one member of the grand jury outside of the drawing system used to compose the balance of that body.  These considerations require us to treat the case as one alleging discriminatory selection of grand jurors.

				In

				 v.

				, we found a white defendant had standing to challenge racial discrimination against black persons in the use of peremptory challenges.  We determined the defendant himself could raise the equal protection rights of the excluded jurors.  Recognizing our general reluctance to permit a litigant to assert the rights of a third party, we found three preconditions had been satisfied: (1) the defendant suffered an &#x93;injury in fact&#x94;; (2) he had a &#x93;close relationship&#x94; to the excluded jurors; and (3) there was some hindrance to the excluded jurors asserting their own rights.

				Although Campbell challenges discriminatory selection of grand jurors, rather than petit jurors, 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				&#x92; reasoning applies to this case on the question of standing.  Our prior cases have not decided whether a white defendant&#x92;s own equal protection rights are violated when the composition of his grand jury is tainted by discrimination against black persons.  We do not need to address this issue because Campbell seeks to assert the well-established equal protection rights of black persons not to be excluded from grand jury service on the basis of their race.

The Court expressed concern that this tactic might encourage the jury to be lawless in its own actions. See 499 U. S., at 412&#x96;413.  The State suggests this sort of harm is not inflicted when a single grand juror is selected based on racial prejudice because the discrimination is invisible to the grand jurors on that panel; it only becomes apparent when a pattern emerges over the course of years.  See Brief for Respondent 16.  This argument, however, underestimates the seriousness of the allegations.  In 
				<em>
					Powers

				, even if the prosecutor had been motivated by racial prejudice, those responsible for the defendant&#x92;s fate, the judge and the jury, had shown no actual bias.

This argument confuses Campbell&#x92;s underlying claim with the evidence needed to prove it.  To assert the rights of those venirepersons who were excluded from serving on the grand jury in his case, Campbell must prove their exclusion was on account of intentional discrimination.  He seeks to do so based on past treatment of similarly situated venirepersons in other cases, see

				A grand jury in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana, indicted petitioner Terry Campbell on one count of second-degree murder.  Campbell, who is white, filed a timely pretrial motion to quash the indictment on the grounds the grand jury was constituted in violation of his equal protection and due process rights under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a> and in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentvi" class="subref" title="subref">Sixth Amendment</a>&#x92;s fair-cross-section requirement.  Campbell alleged a longstanding practice of racial discrimination in the selection of grand jury forepersons in the Parish.  His sole piece of evidence is that, between January 1976 and August 1993, no black person served as a grand jury foreperson in the Parish, even though more than 20 percent of the registered voters were black persons.  See Brief for Petitioner 16.  The State does not dispute this evidence.  The trial judge refused to quash the indictment because &#x93;Campbell, being a white man accused of killing another white man,&#x94; lacked standing to complain &#x93;where all of the forepersons were white.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert.

Because the Court of Appeal had not addressed Campbell&#x92;s other asserted points of error, the Louisiana Supreme Court remanded the case.  After the Court of Appeal rejected Campbell&#x92;s remaining claims, the Louisiana Supreme Court refused to reconsider its ruling on the grand jury issue.  See 685 So. 2d 140 (1997).  We granted certiorari to address the narrow question of Campbell&#x92;s standing to raise equal protection, due process, and fair-cross-section claims.  521 U. S. __ (1997).

				As an initial matter, we note Campbell complains about more than discrimination in the selection of his grand jury foreperson; he alleges that discrimination shaped the composition of the grand jury itself.  In the federal system and in most States which use grand juries, the foreperson is selected from the ranks of the already seated grand jurors.  See 1 S. Beale, W. Bryson, J. Felman &amp; M. Elston, Grand Jury Law and Practice &#xA7;4:6, p. 4&#x96;20 to 4&#x96;21 (2d ed. 1997) (either the judge selects the foreperson or fellow grand jurors elect him or her).  Under those systems, the title &#x93;foreperson&#x94; is bestowed on one of the existing grand jurors without any change in the grand jury&#x92;s composition.  In Louisiana, by contrast, the judge selects the foreperson from the grand jury venire before the remaining members of the grand jury have been chosen by lot.  La. Code Crim. Proc. Ann., Art. 413(B) (West Supp. 1997); see also Beale, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;22, n. 11 (Ohio, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Virginia use procedures similar to Louisiana&#x92;s).  In addition to his other duties, the foreperson of the Louisiana grand jury has the same full voting powers as other grand jury members.  As a result, when the Louisiana judge selected the foreperson, he also selected one member of the grand jury outside of the drawing system used to compose the balance of that body.  These considerations require us to treat the case as one alleging discriminatory selection of grand jurors.

				In

				 v. 
				<em>
					Ohio

				, 
				<em>

				, we found a white defendant had standing to challenge racial discrimination against black persons in the use of peremptory challenges.  We determined the defendant himself could raise the equal protection rights of the excluded jurors.  Recognizing our general reluctance to permit a litigant to assert the rights of a third party, we found three preconditions had been satisfied: (1) the defendant suffered an &#x93;injury in fact&#x94;; (2) he had a &#x93;close relationship&#x94; to the excluded jurors; and (3) there was some hindrance to the excluded jurors asserting their own rights.

				Although Campbell challenges discriminatory selection of grand jurors, rather than petit jurors, 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				&#x92; reasoning applies to this case on the question of standing.  Our prior cases have not decided whether a white defendant&#x92;s own equal protection rights are violated when the composition of his grand jury is tainted by discrimination against black persons.  We do not need to address this issue because Campbell seeks to assert the well-established equal protection rights of black persons not to be excluded from grand jury service on the basis of their race.

The Court expressed concern that this tactic might encourage the jury to be lawless in its own actions. See 499 U. S., at 412&#x96;413.  The State suggests this sort of harm is not inflicted when a single grand juror is selected based on racial prejudice because the discrimination is invisible to the grand jurors on that panel; it only becomes apparent when a pattern emerges over the course of years.  See Brief for Respondent 16.  This argument, however, underestimates the seriousness of the allegations.  In 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				, even if the prosecutor had been motivated by racial prejudice, those responsible for the defendant&#x92;s fate, the judge and the jury, had shown no actual bias.

This argument confuses Campbell&#x92;s underlying claim with the evidence needed to prove it.  To assert the rights of those venirepersons who were excluded from serving on the grand jury in his case, Campbell must prove their exclusion was on account of intentional discrimination.  He seeks to do so based on past treatment of similarly situated venirepersons in other cases, see

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">494</a> (1977)

				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at __.  Against this background, the Court rejected the defendant&#x92;s claim because the ministerial role of a federal grand jury foreperson &#x93;is not such a vital one that discrimination in the appointment of an individual to that post significantly invades&#x94; due process.

				Even if the

				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				 is wholly absent from the context at hand.  
				<em>
					Powers

				 reasoned that repeated peremptory strikes of members of one race constituted an &#x93;overt wrong, often apparent to the entire jury panel,&#x94; that threatened to &#x93;cas[t] doubt over the obligation of the parties, the jury, and indeed the court to adhere to the law throughout the trial of the cause.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				, 499 U. S., at 412.  Here, in contrast, the judge selected one member of the grand jury venire to serve as foreman, and the remaining members of the grand jury were selected at random.  Even if discriminatory, the judge&#x92;s selection (rather than exclusion) of a single member of the grand jury could hardly constitute an &#x93;overt&#x94; wrong that would affect the remainder of the grand jury proceedings, much less the subsequent trial.  The Court therefore resorts to emphasizing the seriousness of the allegation of racial discrimination (as though repetition conveys some talismanic power), but that, of course, cannot substitute for injury in fact.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, unlike

				, petitioner&#x92;s allegation of injury in fact is not merely unsupported; it is directly foreclosed.  There is no allegation in this case that the composition of petitioner&#x92;s 
				<em>
					trial
				</em>
				 jury was affected by discrimination.  Instead, the allegation is merely that there was discrimination in the selection of the grand jury (and of only one member).  The properly constituted petit jury&#x92;s verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was in no way affected by the composition of the grand jury.  Indeed, to the extent that race played any part in the composition of petitioner&#x92;s petit jury, it was by petitioner&#x92;s own actions, as petitioner used five of his twelve peremptory strikes to eliminate blacks from the petit jury venire.  Petitioner&#x92;s attempt to assert that he was injured by the alleged exclusion of blacks at the grand jury stage is belied by his own use of peremptory strikes against blacks at the petit jury stage.

				The Court&#x92;s finding of a close relationship (an ambient fraternity of sorts) between petitioner and the black veniremen whose rights he seeks to vindicate is likewise unsupported.  The Court, of course, never identifies precisely whose rights petitioner seeks to vindicate.  Is it all veniremen who were not chosen as foreman?  Is it all non-white veniremen?  All black veniremen?  Or just the black veniremen who were not ultimately chosen for the grand jury?  Leaving aside the fact that the Court fails to identify the rights-holders, I fail to see how a &#x93;close relationship&#x94; could have developed between petitioner and the veniremen.  Even if a &#x93;bond,&#x94; 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Ohio
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 413, could develop between veniremen and defendants during 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				, such a bond could not develop in the context of a judge&#x92;s selection of a grand jury foreman&#x96;&#x96;a context in which the defendant plays no role.  Nor can any &#x93;common interest,&#x94; between a defendant and excluded veniremen arise based upon a public humiliation suffered by the latter, because unlike the exercise of peremptory strikes, Evangeline Parish&#x92;s process of selecting foremen does not constitute &#x93;overt&#x94; action against particular veniremen.  Rather, those veniremen not chosen (all but one) are simply left to take their chances at being randomly selected for the remaining seats on the grand jury.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, there are ample opportunities for prospective jurors whose equal protection rights have been violated to vindicate those rights, rather than relying upon a defendant of another race to do so for them.  In contrast to the 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 line of cases, where an allegation may concern discrimination in the defendant&#x92;s case alone, in this case petitioner alleges systematic discrimination in the selection of grand jury foremen in Evangeline Parish.  Such systematic discrimination provides a large class of potential plaintiffs and the opportunity for declaratory or injunctive relief to prevent repeated violations.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For these reasons, I would hold that petitioner&#x97;who does not claim that he was discriminated against or that the alleged discrimination against others had any effect on the outcome of his trial&#x96;&#x96;lacks standing to raise the equal protection rights of excluded black veniremen.  Accordingly, I join Parts I, II, IV, and V of the Court&#x92;s opinion and concur in the judgment.

The Batson doctrine, rather than helping to ensure the fairness of criminal trials, serves only to undercut that fairness by emphasizing the rights of excluded jurors at the expense of the traditional protections accorded criminal defendants of all races.

				The Court&#x92;s finding of a close relationship (an ambient fraternity of sorts) between petitioner and the black veniremen whose rights he seeks to vindicate is likewise unsupported.  The Court, of course, never identifies precisely whose rights petitioner seeks to vindicate.  Is it all veniremen who were not chosen as foreman?  Is it all non-white veniremen?  All black veniremen?  Or just the black veniremen who were not ultimately chosen for the grand jury?

Rather, those veniremen not chosen (all but one) are simply left to take their chances at being randomly selected for the remaining seats on the grand jury.

However, I agree with the Court&#x92;s conclusion that petitioner has standing to raise that claim because petitioner asserts his own due process right.

				, 499 U. S., at 412.  Here, in contrast, the judge selected one member of the grand jury venire to serve as foreman, and the remaining members of the grand jury were selected at random.  Even if discriminatory, the judge&#x92;s selection (rather than exclusion) of a single member of the grand jury could hardly constitute an &#x93;overt&#x94; wrong that would affect the remainder of the grand jury proceedings, much less the subsequent trial.  The Court therefore resorts to emphasizing the seriousness of the allegation of racial discrimination (as though repetition conveys some talismanic power), but that, of course, cannot substitute for injury in fact.

				In this case, unlike

				<em>
					trial
				</em>
				 jury was affected by discrimination.  Instead, the allegation is merely that there was discrimination in the selection of the grand jury (and of only one member).  The properly constituted petit jury&#x92;s verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was in no way affected by the composition of the grand jury.  Indeed, to the extent that race played any part in the composition of petitioner&#x92;s petit jury, it was by petitioner&#x92;s own actions, as petitioner used five of his twelve peremptory strikes to eliminate blacks from the petit jury venire.  Petitioner&#x92;s attempt to assert that he was injured by the alleged exclusion of blacks at the grand jury stage is belied by his own use of peremptory strikes against blacks at the petit jury stage.

				The Court&#x92;s finding of a close relationship (an ambient fraternity of sorts) between petitioner and the black veniremen whose rights he seeks to vindicate is likewise unsupported.  The Court, of course, never identifies precisely whose rights petitioner seeks to vindicate.  Is it all veniremen who were not chosen as foreman?  Is it all non-white veniremen?  All black veniremen?  Or just the black veniremen who were not ultimately chosen for the grand jury?  Leaving aside the fact that the Court fails to identify the rights-holders, I fail to see how a &#x93;close relationship&#x94; could have developed between petitioner and the veniremen.  Even if a &#x93;bond,&#x94; 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Ohio
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 413, could develop between veniremen and defendants during 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				, such a bond could not develop in the context of a judge&#x92;s selection of a grand jury foreman&#x96;&#x96;a context in which the defendant plays no role.  Nor can any &#x93;common interest,&#x94; between a defendant and excluded veniremen arise based upon a public humiliation suffered by the latter, because unlike the exercise of peremptory strikes, Evangeline Parish&#x92;s process of selecting foremen does not constitute &#x93;overt&#x94; action against particular veniremen.  Rather, those veniremen not chosen (all but one) are simply left to take their chances at being randomly selected for the remaining seats on the grand jury.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, there are ample opportunities for prospective jurors whose equal protection rights have been violated to vindicate those rights, rather than relying upon a defendant of another race to do so for them.  In contrast to the 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 line of cases, where an allegation may concern discrimination in the defendant&#x92;s case alone, in this case petitioner alleges systematic discrimination in the selection of grand jury foremen in Evangeline Parish.  Such systematic discrimination provides a large class of potential plaintiffs and the opportunity for declaratory or injunctive relief to prevent repeated violations.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For these reasons, I would hold that petitioner&#x97;who does not claim that he was discriminated against or that the alleged discrimination against others had any effect on the outcome of his trial&#x96;&#x96;lacks standing to raise the equal protection rights of excluded black veniremen.  Accordingly, I join Parts I, II, IV, and V of the Court&#x92;s opinion and concur in the judgment.

The Batson doctrine, rather than helping to ensure the fairness of criminal trials, serves only to undercut that fairness by emphasizing the rights of excluded jurors at the expense of the traditional protections accorded criminal defendants of all races.

				The Court&#x92;s finding of a close relationship (an ambient fraternity of sorts) between petitioner and the black veniremen whose rights he seeks to vindicate is likewise unsupported.  The Court, of course, never identifies precisely whose rights petitioner seeks to vindicate.  Is it all veniremen who were not chosen as foreman?  Is it all non-white veniremen?  All black veniremen?  Or just the black veniremen who were not ultimately chosen for the grand jury?  Leaving aside the fact that the Court fails to identify the rights-holders, I fail to see how a &#x93;close relationship&#x94; could have developed between petitioner and the veniremen.

Nor can any &#x93;common interest,&#x94; between a defendant and excluded veniremen arise based upon a public humiliation suffered by the latter, because unlike the exercise of peremptory strikes, Evangeline Parish&#x92;s process of selecting foremen does not constitute &#x93;overt&#x94; action against particular veniremen.  Rather, those veniremen not chosen (all but one) are simply left to take their chances at being randomly selected for the remaining seats on the grand jury.

The Court instead found that the defendant had suffered a 
				<em>
					&#x93;
				</em>
				cognizable&#x94; injury because racial discrimination in jury selection &#x93; &#x91;casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial process&#x92; &#x94; and &#x93;invites cynicism respecting the jury&#x92;s neutrality and its obligation to adhere to the law.&#x94;

Indeed, to the extent that race played any part in the composition of petitioner&#x92;s petit jury, it was by petitioner&#x92;s own actions, as petitioner used five of his twelve peremptory strikes to eliminate blacks from the petit jury venire.

				  Nor can the Court find support in our precedents allowing a defendant to challenge his conviction based upon discrimination in grand jury selection, because all of those cases involved defendants&#x92; assertions of

				The Court&#x92;s finding of a close relationship (an ambient fraternity of sorts) between petitioner and the black veniremen whose rights he seeks to vindicate is likewise unsupported.  The Court, of course, never identifies precisely whose rights petitioner seeks to vindicate.  Is it all veniremen who were not chosen as foreman?  Is it all non-white veniremen?  All black veniremen?  Or just the black veniremen who were not ultimately chosen for the grand jury?  Leaving aside the fact that the Court fails to identify the rights-holders, I fail to see how a &#x93;close relationship&#x94; could have developed between petitioner and the veniremen.  Even if a &#x93;bond,&#x94; 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Ohio
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 413, could develop between veniremen and defendants during 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				, such a bond could not develop in the context of a judge&#x92;s selection of a grand jury foreman&#x96;&#x96;a context in which the defendant plays no role.  Nor can any &#x93;common interest,&#x94; between a defendant and excluded veniremen arise based upon a public humiliation suffered by the latter, because unlike the exercise of peremptory strikes, Evangeline Parish&#x92;s process of selecting foremen does not constitute &#x93;overt&#x94; action against particular veniremen.  Rather, those veniremen not chosen (all but one) are simply left to take their chances at being randomly selected for the remaining seats on the grand jury.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, there are ample opportunities for prospective jurors whose equal protection rights have been violated to vindicate those rights, rather than relying upon a defendant of another race to do so for them.  In contrast to the 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 line of cases, where an allegation may concern discrimination in the defendant&#x92;s case alone, in this case petitioner alleges systematic discrimination in the selection of grand jury foremen in Evangeline Parish.  Such systematic discrimination provides a large class of potential plaintiffs and the opportunity for declaratory or injunctive relief to prevent repeated violations.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For these reasons, I would hold that petitioner&#x97;who does not claim that he was discriminated against or that the alleged discrimination against others had any effect on the outcome of his trial&#x96;&#x96;lacks standing to raise the equal protection rights of excluded black veniremen.  Accordingly, I join Parts I, II, IV, and V of the Court&#x92;s opinion and concur in the judgment.

						 As I have explained elsewhere, the entire line of cases following Batson v. Kentucky, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)
 (holding that the Equal Protection Clause applies to the use of peremptory strikes), including Powers, is a misguided effort to remedy a general societal wrong by using the Constitution to regulate the traditionally discretionary exercise of peremptory challenges.  The Batson doctrine, rather than helping to ensure the fairness of criminal trials, serves only to undercut that fairness by emphasizing the rights of excluded jurors at the expense of the traditional protections accorded criminal defendants of all races.  See Georgia v. McCollum,

						 For this reason, it is unlikely that petitioner ultimately will prevail on the merits of his due process claim.  However, I agree with the Court&#x92;s conclusion that petitioner has standing to raise that claim because petitioner asserts his own due process right.  I join Part IV of the Court&#x92;s opinion because it addresses only standing and does not address &#x93;the nature and extent&#x94; of petitioner&#x92;s due process right.  Ante, at 7.

				The Court&#x92;s finding of a close relationship (an ambient fraternity of sorts) between petitioner and the black veniremen whose rights he seeks to vindicate is likewise unsupported.  The Court, of course, never identifies precisely whose rights petitioner seeks to vindicate.  Is it all veniremen who were not chosen as foreman?  Is it all non-white veniremen?  All black veniremen?  Or just the black veniremen who were not ultimately chosen for the grand jury?  Leaving aside the fact that the Court fails to identify the rights-holders, I fail to see how a &#x93;close relationship&#x94; could have developed between petitioner and the veniremen.  Even if a &#x93;bond,&#x94;

				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				, such a bond could not develop in the context of a judge&#x92;s selection of a grand jury foreman&#x96;&#x96;a context in which the defendant plays no role.  Nor can any &#x93;common interest,&#x94; between a defendant and excluded veniremen arise based upon a public humiliation suffered by the latter, because unlike the exercise of peremptory strikes, Evangeline Parish&#x92;s process of selecting foremen does not constitute &#x93;overt&#x94; action against particular veniremen.  Rather, those veniremen not chosen (all but one) are simply left to take their chances at being randomly selected for the remaining seats on the grand jury.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, there are ample opportunities for prospective jurors whose equal protection rights have been violated to vindicate those rights, rather than relying upon a defendant of another race to do so for them.  In contrast to the 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 line of cases, where an allegation may concern discrimination in the defendant&#x92;s case alone, in this case petitioner alleges systematic discrimination in the selection of grand jury foremen in Evangeline Parish.

				For these reasons, I would hold that petitioner&#x97;who does not claim that he was discriminated against or that the alleged discrimination against others had any effect on the outcome of his trial&#x96;&#x96;lacks standing to raise the equal protection rights of excluded black veniremen.

				, at 426&#x96;429 (dissenting opinion).  The defendant, though certainly displeased with his conviction, failed to demonstrate that the alleged discriminatory use of peremptory challenges against veniremen of another race had any effect on the outcome of his trial.  The Court instead found that the defendant had suffered a 
				<em>
					&#x93;
				</em>
				cognizable&#x94; injury because racial discrimination in jury selection &#x93; &#x91;casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial process&#x92; &#x94; and &#x93;invites cynicism respecting the jury&#x92;s neutrality and its obligation to adhere to the law.&#x94;

Regardless of whether black veniremen wish to serve on a particular jury, they do not share the white defendant&#x92;s interest in obtaining a reversal of his conviction.

				Even if the

				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				 is wholly absent from the context at hand.  
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				 reasoned that repeated peremptory strikes of members of one race constituted an &#x93;overt wrong, often apparent to the entire jury panel,&#x94; that threatened to &#x93;cas[t] doubt over the obligation of the parties, the jury, and indeed the court to adhere to the law throughout the trial of the cause.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				, 499 U. S., at 412.  Here, in contrast, the judge selected one member of the grand jury venire to serve as foreman, and the remaining members of the grand jury were selected at random.  Even if discriminatory, the judge&#x92;s selection (rather than exclusion) of a single member of the grand jury could hardly constitute an &#x93;overt&#x94; wrong that would affect the remainder of the grand jury proceedings, much less the subsequent trial.  The Court therefore resorts to emphasizing the seriousness of the allegation of racial discrimination (as though repetition conveys some talismanic power), but that, of course, cannot substitute for injury in fact.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, unlike 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				, petitioner&#x92;s allegation of injury in fact is not merely unsupported; it is directly foreclosed.  There is no allegation in this case that the composition of petitioner&#x92;s 
				<em>
					trial
				</em>
				 jury was affected by discrimination.  Instead, the allegation is merely that there was discrimination in the selection of the grand jury (and of only one member).  The properly constituted petit jury&#x92;s verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was in no way affected by the composition of the grand jury.  Indeed, to the extent that race played any part in the composition of petitioner&#x92;s petit jury, it was by petitioner&#x92;s own actions, as petitioner used five of his twelve peremptory strikes to eliminate blacks from the petit jury venire.  Petitioner&#x92;s attempt to assert that he was injured by the alleged exclusion of blacks at the grand jury stage is belied by his own use of peremptory strikes against blacks at the petit jury stage.

				The Court&#x92;s finding of a close relationship (an ambient fraternity of sorts) between petitioner and the black veniremen whose rights he seeks to vindicate is likewise unsupported.  The Court, of course, never identifies precisely whose rights petitioner seeks to vindicate.  Is it all veniremen who were not chosen as foreman?  Is it all non-white veniremen?  All black veniremen?  Or just the black veniremen who were not ultimately chosen for the grand jury?  Leaving aside the fact that the Court fails to identify the rights-holders, I fail to see how a &#x93;close relationship&#x94; could have developed between petitioner and the veniremen.  Even if a &#x93;bond,&#x94; 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Ohio
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 413, could develop between veniremen and defendants during 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				, such a bond could not develop in the context of a judge&#x92;s selection of a grand jury foreman&#x96;&#x96;a context in which the defendant plays no role.  Nor can any &#x93;common interest,&#x94; between a defendant and excluded veniremen arise based upon a public humiliation suffered by the latter, because unlike the exercise of peremptory strikes, Evangeline Parish&#x92;s process of selecting foremen does not constitute &#x93;overt&#x94; action against particular veniremen.  Rather, those veniremen not chosen (all but one) are simply left to take their chances at being randomly selected for the remaining seats on the grand jury.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, there are ample opportunities for prospective jurors whose equal protection rights have been violated to vindicate those rights, rather than relying upon a defendant of another race to do so for them.  In contrast to the 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 line of cases, where an allegation may concern discrimination in the defendant&#x92;s case alone, in this case petitioner alleges systematic discrimination in the selection of grand jury foremen in Evangeline Parish.  Such systematic discrimination provides a large class of potential plaintiffs and the opportunity for declaratory or injunctive relief to prevent repeated violations.

				For these reasons, I would hold that petitioner&#x97;who does not claim that he was discriminated against or that the alleged discrimination against others had any effect on the outcome of his trial&#x96;&#x96;lacks standing to raise the equal protection rights of excluded black veniremen.  Accordingly, I join Parts I, II, IV, and V of the Court&#x92;s opinion and concur in the judgment.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/476/79" class="subref" title="subref">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986)
 (holding that the Equal Protection Clause applies to the use of peremptory strikes), including Powers, is a misguided effort to remedy a general societal wrong by using the Constitution to regulate the traditionally discretionary exercise of peremptory challenges.  The Batson doctrine, rather than helping to ensure the fairness of criminal trials, serves only to undercut that fairness by emphasizing the rights of excluded jurors at the expense of the traditional protections accorded criminal defendants of all races.  See Georgia v. McCollum,

						 For this reason, it is unlikely that petitioner ultimately will prevail on the merits of his due process claim.  However, I agree with the Court&#x92;s conclusion that petitioner has standing to raise that claim because petitioner asserts his own due process right.  I join Part IV of the Court&#x92;s opinion because it addresses only standing and does not address &#x93;the nature and extent&#x94; of petitioner&#x92;s due process right.  Ante, at 7.

				The Court&#x92;s finding of a close relationship (an ambient fraternity of sorts) between petitioner and the black veniremen whose rights he seeks to vindicate is likewise unsupported.  The Court, of course, never identifies precisely whose rights petitioner seeks to vindicate.  Is it all veniremen who were not chosen as foreman?  Is it all non-white veniremen?  All black veniremen?  Or just the black veniremen who were not ultimately chosen for the grand jury?  Leaving aside the fact that the Court fails to identify the rights-holders, I fail to see how a &#x93;close relationship&#x94; could have developed between petitioner and the veniremen.  Even if a &#x93;bond,&#x94; 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Ohio
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 413, could develop between veniremen and defendants during 
				<em>
					voir dire
				</em>
				, such a bond could not develop in the context of a judge&#x92;s selection of a grand jury foreman&#x96;&#x96;a context in which the defendant plays no role.  Nor can any &#x93;common interest,&#x94; between a defendant and excluded veniremen arise based upon a public humiliation suffered by the latter, because unlike the exercise of peremptory strikes, Evangeline Parish&#x92;s process of selecting foremen does not constitute &#x93;overt&#x94; action against particular veniremen.  Rather, those veniremen not chosen (all but one) are simply left to take their chances at being randomly selected for the remaining seats on the grand jury.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, there are ample opportunities for prospective jurors whose equal protection rights have been violated to vindicate those rights, rather than relying upon a defendant of another race to do so for them.  In contrast to the 
				<em>
					Batson
				</em>
				 line of cases, where an allegation may concern discrimination in the defendant&#x92;s case alone, in this case petitioner alleges systematic discrimination in the selection of grand jury foremen in Evangeline Parish.  Such systematic discrimination provides a large class of potential plaintiffs and the opportunity for declaratory or injunctive relief to prevent repeated violations.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				For these reasons, I would hold that petitioner&#x97;who does not claim that he was discriminated against or that the alleged discrimination against others had any effect on the outcome of his trial&#x96;&#x96;lacks standing to raise the equal protection rights of excluded black veniremen.  Accordingly, I join Parts I, II, IV, and V of the Court&#x92;s opinion and concur in the judgment.

				<em>
					Id.

				, at 426&#x96;429 (dissenting opinion).  The defendant, though certainly displeased with his conviction, failed to demonstrate that the alleged discriminatory use of peremptory challenges against veniremen of another race had any effect on the outcome of his trial.  The Court instead found that the defendant had suffered a 
				<em>
					&#x93;
				</em>
				cognizable&#x94; injury because racial discrimination in jury selection &#x93; &#x91;casts doubt on the integrity of the judicial process&#x92; &#x94; and &#x93;invites cynicism respecting the jury&#x92;s neutrality and its obligation to adhere to the law.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 411&#x96;412.  But the severity of an alleged wrong and a perception of unfairness do not constitute injury in fact.  Indeed, &#x93; &#x91;[i]njury in perception&#x92; would seem to be the very 
				<em>

				 permits them &#x93;to establish a relation, if not a bond of trust,&#x94; that continues throughout the trial.  
				<em>
					Id.

				, at 411, 413.  According to the Court, excluded veniremen share the accused&#x92;s interest in eliminating racial discrimination because a peremptory strike inflicts upon a venireman a &#x93;profound personal humiliation heightened by its public character.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.

				, at 413&#x96;414.  But there was simply no basis for the Court&#x92;s finding of a &#x93;close relation[ship]&#x94; or &#x93;common interest,&#x94; 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 413, between black veniremen and white defendants.  Regardless of whether black veniremen wish to serve on a particular jury, they do not share the white defendant&#x92;s interest in obtaining a reversal of his conviction.  Surely a black venireman would be dismayed to learn that a white defendant used the venireman&#x92;s constitutional rights as a means to overturn the defendant&#x92;s conviction.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even if the 
				<em>

				</em>
				 justifications were persuasive, they would still be wholly inapplicable to this case, which involves neither peremptory strikes nor discrimination in the selection of the petit jury.  The &#x93;injury in fact&#x94; allegedly present in 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				 is wholly absent from the context at hand.  
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				 reasoned that repeated peremptory strikes of members of one race constituted an &#x93;overt wrong, often apparent to the entire jury panel,&#x94; that threatened to &#x93;cas[t] doubt over the obligation of the parties, the jury, and indeed the court to adhere to the law throughout the trial of the cause.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				, 499 U. S., at 412.  Here, in contrast, the judge selected one member of the grand jury venire to serve as foreman, and the remaining members of the grand jury were selected at random.  Even if discriminatory, the judge&#x92;s selection (rather than exclusion) of a single member of the grand jury could hardly constitute an &#x93;overt&#x94; wrong that would affect the remainder of the grand jury proceedings, much less the subsequent trial.  The Court therefore resorts to emphasizing the seriousness of the allegation of racial discrimination (as though repetition conveys some talismanic power), but that, of course, cannot substitute for injury in fact.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In this case, unlike 
				<em>
					Powers
				</em>
				, petitioner&#x92;s allegation of injury in fact is not merely unsupported; it is directly foreclosed.  There is no allegation in this case that the composition of petitioner&#x92;s 
				<em>
					trial
				</em>
				 jury was affected by discrimination.  Instead, the allegation is merely that there was discrimination in the selection of the grand jury (and of only one member).  The properly constituted petit jury&#x92;s verdict of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt was in no way affected by the composition of the grand jury.  Indeed, to the extent that race played any part in the composition of petitioner&#x92;s petit jury, it was by petitioner&#x92;s own actions, as petitioner used five of his twelve peremptory strikes to eliminate blacks from the petit jury venire.  Petitioner&#x92;s attempt to assert that he was injured by the alleged exclusion of blacks at the grand jury stage is belied by his own use of peremptory strikes against blacks at the petit jury stage.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				It would be to no avail to suggest that the alleged discrimination in grand jury selection could have caused an indictment improperly to be rendered, because the petit jury&#x92;s verdict conclusively establishes that no reasonable grand jury could have failed to indict petitioner.
