        <p class="bodytext">Section 203 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA), makes it a federal crime for a corporation to use its general treasury funds to pay for any &#x93;electioneering communication,&#x94; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/441b.html#b_2" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;441b(b)(2)</a>, which BCRA defines as any broadcast that refers to a candidate for federal office and is aired within 30 days of a federal primary election or 60 days of a federal general election in the jurisdiction where that candidate is running, &#xA7;434(f)(3)(A).  In <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n, </em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/540/93" class="subref" title="subref">540 U. S. 93</a>, this Court upheld &#xA7;203 against a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> facial challenge even though the section encompassed not only campaign speech, or &#x93;express advocacy&#x94; promoting a candidate&#x92;s election or defeat, but also &#x93;issue advocacy,&#x94; or speech about public issues more generally, that also mentions such a candidate.  The Court concluded there was no overbreadth concern to the extent the speech in question was the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy.  <em>Id.</em>, at 204&#x96;205, 206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">        On July 26, 2004, appellee Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc. (WRTL), began broadcasting advertisements declaring that a group of Senators was filibustering to delay and block federal judicial nominees and telling voters to contact Wisconsin Senators Feingold and Kohl to urge them to oppose the filibuster.  WRTL planned to run the ads throughout August 2004 and finance them with its general treasury funds.  Recognizing, however, that as of August 15, 30 days before the Wisconsin primary, the ads would be illegal &#x93;electioneering communication[s]&#x94; under BCRA &#xA7;203, but believing that it nonetheless had a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to broadcast them, WRTL filed suit against the Federal Election Commission (FEC), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and alleging that &#xA7;203&#x92;s prohibition was unconstitutional as applied to the three ads in question, as well as any materially similar ads WRTL might run in the future.  Just before the BCRA blackout, the three-judge District Court denied a preliminary injunction, concluding that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s reasoning that &#xA7;203 was not facially overbroad left no room for such &#x93;as-applied&#x94; challenges.  WRTL did not run its ads during the blackout period, and the court subsequently dismissed the complaint.  This Court vacated that judgment, holding that <em>McConnell</em> &#x93;did not purport to resolve future as-applied challenges&#x94; to &#xA7;203.  <em>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n </em>(<em>WRTL I</em>), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/546/410" class="subref" title="subref">546 U. S. 410</a>.  On remand, the District Court granted WRTL summary judgment, holding &#xA7;203 unconstitutional as applied to the three ads.  The court first found that adjudication was not barred by mootness because the controversy was capable of repetition, yet evading review.  On the merits, it concluded that the ads were genuine issue ads,<em> not</em> express advocacy or its &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; under <em>McConnell, </em>and held that no compelling interest justified BCRA&#x92;s regulation of such ads.  </p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>Held:</em> The judgment is affirmed.</p>
        <p class="SYLCTG">466 F. Supp. 2d 195, affirmed.</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
            <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice </span>delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to<span class="smallcaps"/>Parts I and<span class="smallcaps"> II, </span>concluding that<span class="smallcaps"/>the Court has jurisdiction to decide these cases.  The FEC argues that the cases are moot because the 2004 election has passed and WRTL neither asserts a continuing interest in running its ads nor identifies any reason to believe that a significant dispute over Senate filibusters of judicial nominees will occur in the foreseeable future.  These cases, however, fit comfortably within the established exception to mootness for disputes capable of repetition, yet evading review.  That exception applies where &#x93;(1) the challenged action is in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party will be subject to the same action again,&#x94; <em>Spencer</em> v. <em>Kemna</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/523/1" class="subref" title="subref">523 U. S. 1</a>.  Both circumstances are present here.  First, it would be unreasonable to expect that WRTL could have obtained complete judicial review of its claims in time to air its ads during the BCRA blackout periods.  Indeed, <em>two </em>BCRA blackout periods have passed during the pendency of this action.  Second, there exists a reasonable expectation that the same &#x93;controversy&#x94; involving the same party will recur: WRTL has credibly claimed that it plans to run materially similar targeted ads during future blackout periods, and there is no reason to believe that the FEC will refrain from prosecuting future BCRA violations.  Pp. 7&#x96;10.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice,</span> joined by <span class="smallcaps">Justice Alito,</span> concluded that BCRA &#xA7;203 is unconstitutional as applied to the ads at issue in these cases.  Pp. 10&#x96;29.  </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    1. The speech at issue is not the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express campaign speech.  Pp.  10&#x96;22.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (a) Appellants are wrong in arguing that WRTL has the burden of demonstrating that &#xA7;203 is unconstitutional.  Because &#xA7;203 burdens political speech, it is subject to strict scrutiny, see, <em>e.g., McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 205, under which the <em>Government</em> must prove that applying BCRA to WRTL&#x92;s ads furthers a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest, see <em>First Nat. Bank of Boston</em> v. <em>Bellotti</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/435/765" class="subref" title="subref">435 U. S. 765</a>.  Given that <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 206, already ruled that BCRA survives strict scrutiny to the extent it regulates express advocacy or its functional equivalent, the FEC&#x92;s burden is not onerous insofar as these ads fit this description.  Pp. 10&#x96;11. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (b) Contrary to the FEC&#x92;s contention, <em>McConnell, </em>540 U. S., at 205&#x96;206, did not establish an intent-and-effect test for determining if a particular ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Indeed, <em>McConnell </em>did not adopt any test for future as-applied challenges, but simply grounded its analysis in the evidentiary record, which included two key studies that separated ads based on whether they were intended to, or had the effect of, supporting candidates for federal office.  <em>Id.,</em> at 308&#x96;309.  More importantly, <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a>, rejected an intent-and-effect test for distinguishing between discussions of issues and candidates, and<em> McConnell </em>did not purport to overrule <em>Buckley</em> on this point&#x97;or even address what <em>Buckley </em>had to say on the subject.  Pp. 11&#x96;15. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (c) Because WRTL&#x92;s ads may reasonably be interpreted as something other than an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate, they are not the functional equivalent of express advocacy, and therefore fall outside <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s scope.  To safeguard freedom of speech on public issues, the proper standard for an as-applied challenge to BCRA &#xA7;203 must be objective, focusing on the communication&#x92;s substance rather than on amorphous considerations of intent and effect.  See <em>Buckley, supra</em>,<em/>at 43&#x96;44. <em/>It must entail minimal if any discovery, to allow parties to resolve disputes quickly without chilling speech through the threat of burdensome litigation.  See <em>Virginia</em> v. <em>Hicks</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/539/113" class="subref" title="subref">539 U. S. 113</a>.  And it must eschew &#x93;the open-ended rough-and-tumble of factors,&#x94; which &#x93;invit[es] complex argument in a trial court and a virtually inevitable appeal.&#x94;  <em>Jerome B. Grubart, Inc.</em> v. <em>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co.</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/513/527" class="subref" title="subref">513 U. S. 527</a>.  In short, it must give the benefit of any doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech.  See <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/376/254" class="subref" title="subref">376 U. S. 254</a>.  In light of these considerations, a court should find that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  WRTL&#x92;s three ads are plainly not the functional equivalent of express advocacy under this test.  First, their content is consistent with that of a genuine issue ad: They focus and take a position on a legislative issue and exhort the public to adopt that position and to contact public officials with respect to the matter.  Second, their content lacks indicia of express advocacy: They do not mention an election, candidacy, political party, or challenger; and they take no position on a candidate&#x92;s character, qualifications, or fitness for office.  Pp. 15&#x96;22. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    2. Because WRTL&#x92;s ads are not express advocacy or its functional equivalent, and because appellants identify no interest sufficiently compelling to justify burdening WRTL&#x92;s speech, BCRA &#xA7;203 is unconstitutional as applied to the ads.  The section can be constitutionally applied only if it is narrowly tailored to further a compelling interest.  <em>E.g., McConnell, supra</em>, at 205.  None of the interests that might justify regulating WRTL&#x92;s ads are sufficiently compelling.  Although the Court has long recognized &#x93;the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption&#x94; in election campaigns, <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 45, it has invoked this interest as a reason for upholding <em>contribution</em> limits, <em>id.,</em> at 26&#x96;27, and suggested that it might also justify limits on electioneering <em>expenditures</em> posing the same dangers as large contributions, <em>id.,</em> at 45.  <em>McConnell</em> arguably applied this interest to ads that were the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy.  See 540 U. S., at 204&#x96;206.  But to justify regulation of WRTL&#x92;s ads, this interest must be stretched yet another step to ads that are <em>not</em> the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Issue ads like WRTL&#x92;s are not equivalent to contributions, and the corruption interest cannot justify regulating them.  A second possible compelling interest lies in addressing &#x93;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x94;  <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/652" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 652</a>.  <em>McConnell</em> held that this interest justifies regulating the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of campaign speech, 540 U. S., at 205&#x96;206.  This interest cannot be extended further to apply to genuine issue ads like WRTL&#x92;s, see,<em> e.g., id.,</em> at 206, n. 88, because doing so would call into question this Court&#x92;s holdings that the corporate identity of a speaker does not strip corporations of all free speech rights.  <em>WRTL I </em>reinforced the validity of this point by holding &#xA7;203 susceptible to as-applied challenges.  546 U. S., at 411&#x96;412.  Pp. 23&#x96;28.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    3. These cases present no occasion to revisit <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding that a corporation&#x92;s express advocacy of a candidate or his opponent shortly before an election may be prohibited, along with the functional equivalent of such express advocacy.  But when it comes to defining what speech qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy subject to such a ban&#x97;the question here&#x97;the Court should give the benefit of the doubt to speech, not censorship.  Pp. 28&#x96;29.</p>

            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Scalia,</span> joined by <span class="smallcaps">Justice Kennedy</span> and <span class="smallcaps">Justice Thomas</span>, agreed that the Court has jurisdiction in these cases and concurred in the Court&#x92;s judgment because he would overrule that part of <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/540/93" class="subref" title="subref">540 U. S. 93</a>, upholding &#xA7;203(a) of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 (BCRA).  Pp. 4&#x96;23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    1. The pertinent case law begins with <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a>, in which the Court held, <em>inter alia,</em> that a federal limitation on campaign expenditures not made in coordination with a candidate&#x92;s campaign (contained in the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA)) was unconstitutional, <em>id.</em>, at 39&#x96;51.  In light of vagueness concerns, the Court narrowly construed the independent-expenditure provision to cover only express advocacy of the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office by use of such magic words &#x93;as &#x91;vote for,&#x92; &#x91;elect,&#x92; &#x2026; &#x91;vote against,&#x92; &#x91;defeat,&#x92; &#x91;reject.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 44, and n. 52.  This narrowing construction excluded so-called &#x93;issue advocacy&#x94; referring to a clearly identified candidate&#x92;s position on an issue, but not expressly advocating his election or defeat.  Even as narrowly construed, however, the Court struck the provision down.  <em>Id.</em>, at 45&#x96;46.  Despite <em>Buckley,</em> some argued that independent expenditures <em>by corporations</em> should be treated differently.  A post-<em>Buckley</em> case, <em>First Nat. Bank of Boston</em> v. <em>Bellotti</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/435/765" class="subref" title="subref">435 U. S. 765</a>, struck down, on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> grounds, a state statute prohibiting corporations from spending money in connection with a referendum.  The Court strayed far from these principles, however, in <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/652" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 652</a>, upholding state restrictions on corporations&#x92; independent expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, candidates for state office, <em>id.</em>, at 654&#x96;655.  <em>Austin</em> was wrongly decided, but at least it was limited to express advocacy.  <em>Nonexpress</em> advocacy was presumed to remain protected under <em>Buckley</em> and <em>Bellotti, </em>even when engaged in by corporations, until <em>McConnell</em>.  <em>McConnell</em> held, <em>inter alia,</em> that the compelling governmental interest supporting restrictions on corporate expenditures for express advocacy&#x97;<em>i.e.,</em>
            <em>Austin</em>&#x92;s perceived &#x93;corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of [corporate] wealth,&#x94; 540 U. S., at 205&#x97;also justified extending those restrictions to ads run during the BCRA blackout period &#x93;to the extent &#x2026; [they] are <em>the functional equivalent of express advocacy,</em>&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 206 (emphasis added).  <em>McConnell</em> upheld BCRA &#xA7;203(a) against a facial challenge.  Subsequently, in <em>Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/546/410" class="subref" title="subref">546 U. S. 410</a>, the Court held that <em>McConnell</em> did not foreclose as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203.  Pp. 4&#x96;10. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    2. <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding concerning &#xA7;203 was wrong.  The answer to whether WRTL meets the standard for prevailing in an as-applied challenge requires the Court to articulate the standard.  The most obvious standard is <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s, which asks whether an ad is the &#x93;functional equivalent of express advocacy,&#x94; 540 U. S., at 206.  The fundamental and inescapable problem with this test, with the principal opinion&#x92;s susceptible-of-no-other-reasonable-interpretation standard, and with other similar tests is that each is impermissibly vague and thus ineffective to vindicate the fundamental 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights at issue.  <em>Buckley</em> itself compelled the conclusion that such tests fall short when it narrowed the statutory language there at issue to cover only advertising that used the magic words of express advocacy.  424 U. S., at 43&#x96;44.  The only plausible explanation for <em>Buckley</em>&#x92;s &#x93;highly strained&#x94; reading of FECA, <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 280, is that the Court there eschewed narrowing constructions that would have been more faithful to FECA&#x92;s text and more effective at capturing campaign speech <em>because those tests were all too vague</em>.  If <em>Buckley</em> foreclosed such vagueness in a statutory test, it also must foreclose such vagueness in an as-applied test.  Yet any clear rule that would protect all genuine issue ads would cover such a substantial number of ads prohibited by &#xA7;203 that &#xA7;203 would be rendered substantially overbroad.  Thus, <em>McConnell </em>(which presupposed the availability of as-applied challenges)<em/>was mistaken.  Pp. 10&#x96;18. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    3. <em>Stare decisis </em>would not prevent the Court from overruling <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s &#xA7;203 holding.  This Court&#x92;s &#x93;considered practice&#x94; is not to apply that principle <em>&#x93;</em>as rigidly in constitutional as in nonconstitutional cases,&#x94; <em>Glidden Co.</em> v. <em>Zdanok</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/370/530" class="subref" title="subref">370 U. S. 530</a>, and it has not hesitated to overrule a decision offensive to the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> that was decided just a few years earlier, see <em>West Virginia Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Barnette</em>,

C. &#xA7;441b(b)(2)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV), makes it a federal crime for any corporation to broadcast, shortly before an election, any communication that names a federal candidate for elected office and is targeted to the electorate.  In <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/540/93" class="subref" title="subref">540 U. S. 93</a> (2003)
, this Court considered whether &#xA7;203 was facially overbroad under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> because it captured within its reach not only campaign speech, or &#x93;express advocacy,&#x94; but also speech about public issues more generally, or &#x93;issue advocacy,&#x94; that mentions a candidate for federal office.  The Court concluded that there was no overbreadth concern to the extent the speech in question was the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express campaign speech.  <em>Id.</em>, at 204&#x96;205, 206.  On the other hand, the Court &#x93;assume[d]&#x94; that the interests it had found to &#x93;justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads.&#x94;  <em>Id., </em>at 206, n. 88.  The Court nonetheless determined that &#xA7;203 was not facially overbroad.  Even assuming &#xA7;203 &#x93;inhibit[ed] some constitutionally protected corporate and union speech,&#x94; the Court concluded that those challenging the law on its face had failed to carry their &#x93;heavy burden&#x94; of establishing that <em>all </em>enforcement of the law should therefore be prohibited.  <em>Id.,</em> at 207.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Last Term, we reversed a lower court ruling, arising in the same litigation before us now, that our decision in <em>McConnell</em> left &#x93;no room&#x94; for as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203.

        <p class="bodytext">    We now confront such an as-applied challenge.

 (<em>per curiam</em>).  Our development of the law in this area requires us, however, to draw such a line, because we have recognized that the interests held to justify the regulation of campaign speech and its &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; &#x93;might not apply&#x94; to the regulation of issue advocacy.  <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 206, and n. 88.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In drawing that line, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> requires us to err on the side of protecting political speech rather than suppressing it.  We conclude that the speech at issue in this as-applied challenge is not the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express campaign speech.  We further conclude that the interests held to justify restricting corporate campaign speech or its functional equivalent do not justify restricting issue advocacy, and accordingly we hold that BCRA &#xA7;203 is unconstitutional as applied to the advertisements at issue in these cases.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL planned on running &#x93;Wedding,&#x94; &#x93;Waiting,&#x94; and &#x93;Loan&#x94; throughout August 2004 and financing the ads with funds from its general treasury.  It recognized, however, that as of August 15, 30 days prior to the Wisconsin primary, the ads would be illegal &#x93;electioneering communication[s]&#x94; under BCRA &#xA7;203.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Believing that it nonetheless possessed a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to broadcast these ads, WRTL filed suit against the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on July 28, 2004, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief before a three-judge District Court.  See note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/437h.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;437h</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV); 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2284.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;2284</a>.  WRTL alleged that BCRA&#x92;s prohibition on the use of corporate treasury funds for &#x93;electioneering communication[s]&#x94; as defined in the Act is unconstitutional as applied to &#x93;Wedding,&#x94; &#x93;Loan,&#x94; and &#x93;Waiting,&#x94; as well as any materially similar ads it might seek to run in the future.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Just before the BCRA blackout period was to begin, the District Court denied a preliminary injunction, concluding that &#x93;the reasoning of the <em>McConnell</em> Court leaves no room for the kind of &#x91;as applied&#x92; challenge WRTL propounds before us.&#x94;  App. to Juris. Statement 52a.  In response to this ruling, WRTL did not run its ads during the blackout period.  The District Court subsequently dismissed WRTL&#x92;s complaint.  See <em>id.,</em> at 47a&#x96;48a (&#x93;WRTL&#x92;s &#x91;as-applied&#x92; challenge to BCRA [&#xA7;203] is foreclosed by the Supreme Court&#x92;s decision in <em>McConnell</em>&#x94;).  On appeal, we vacated the District Court&#x92;s judgment, holding that <em>McConnell</em> &#x93;did not purport to resolve future as-applied challenges&#x94; to BCRA &#xA7;203, and remanded &#x93;for the District Court to consider the merits of WRTL&#x92;s as-applied challenge in the first instance.&#x94;  <em>WRTL I</em>, 546 U. S., at 412.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On remand, after allowing four Members of Congress to intervene as defendants, the three-judge District Court granted summary judgment for WRTL, holding BCRA &#xA7;203 unconstitutional as applied to the three advertisements WRTL planned to run during the 2004 blackout period.  The District Court first found adjudication of the dispute not barred by mootness because the controversy was &#x93; &#x91;capable of repetition, yet evading review.&#x92; &#x94;  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 202.  Turning to the merits, the court began by noting that under <em>McConnell</em>, BCRA could constitutionally proscribe &#x93;express advocacy&#x94;&#x97;defined as ads that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office&#x97;and the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of such advocacy.  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 204.  Stating that it was limiting its inquiry to &#x93;language within the four corners&#x94; of the ads, <em>id.,</em> at 207, the District Court concluded that the ads were <em>not</em> express advocacy or its functional equivalent, but instead &#x93;genuine issue ads.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 205&#x96;208.  Then, reaching a question &#x93;left open in <em>McConnell</em>,&#x94; the court held that no compelling interest justified BCRA&#x92;s regulation of genuine issue ads such as those WRTL sought to run.  <em>Id., </em>at 208&#x96;210.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    One judge dissented, contending that the majority&#x92;s &#x93;plain facial analysis of the text in WRTL&#x92;s 2004 advertisements&#x94; ignored &#x93;the context in which the text was developed.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 210 (opinion of Roberts, J.).  In that judge&#x92;s view, a contextual analysis of the ads revealed &#x93;deep factual rifts between the parties concerning the purpose and intended effects of the ads&#x94; such that neither side was entitled to summary judgment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 210, 211.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC and intervenors filed separate notices of appeal and jurisdictional statements.

.  Based on these principles, the FEC argues (though the intervenors do not) that these cases are moot because the 2004 election has passed and WRTL &#x93;does not assert any continuing interest in running [its three] advertisements, nor does it identify any reason to believe that a significant dispute over Senate filibusters of judicial nominees will occur in the foreseeable future.&#x94;  Brief for Appellant FEC 21.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    As the District Court found, it would be &#x93;entirely unreasonable . . . to expect that [WRTL] could have obtained complete judicial review of its claims in time for it to air its ads&#x94; during the BCRA blackout periods.  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 202.  The FEC contends that the 2-year window between elections provides ample time for parties to litigate their rights before each BCRA blackout period.  But groups like WRTL cannot predict what issues will be matters of public concern during a future blackout period.  In these cases, WRTL had no way of knowing well in advance that it would want to run ads on judicial filibusters during the BCRA blackout period.

        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC asks for too much.  We have recognized that the &#x93; &#x91;capable of repetition, yet evading review&#x92; doctrine, in the context of election cases, is appropriate when there are &#x91;as applied&#x92; challenges as well as in the more typical case involving only facial attacks.&#x94;  <em>Storer</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/415/724" class="subref" title="subref">415 U. S. 724</a>, n. 8 (1974).  Requiring repetition of every &#x93;legally relevant&#x94; characteristic of an as-applied challenge&#x97;down to the last detail&#x97;would effectively overrule this statement by making this exception unavailable for virtually all as-applied challenges.  History repeats itself, but not at the level of specificity demanded by the FEC.  Here, WRTL credibly claimed that it planned on running &#x93; &#x91;materially similar&#x92; &#x94; future targeted broadcast ads mentioning a candidate within the blackout period, 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 197, and there is no reason to believe that the FEC will &#x93;refrain from prosecuting violations&#x94; of BCRA, <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 775.  Under the circumstances, particularly where WRTL sought another preliminary injunction based on an ad it planned to run during the 2006 blackout period, see 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 203, n. 15, we hold that there exists a reasonable expectation that the same controversy involving the same party will recur.  We have jurisdiction to decide these cases.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL rightly concedes that its ads are prohibited by BCRA &#xA7;203.  Each ad clearly identifies Senator Feingold, who was running (unopposed) in the Wisconsin Democratic primary on September 14, 2004, and each ad would have been &#x93;targeted to the relevant electorate,&#x94; see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_C" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(C)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV), during the BCRA blackout period.  WRTL further concedes that its ads do not fit under any of BCRA&#x92;s exceptions to the term &#x93;electioneering communication.&#x94;  See &#xA7;434(f)(3)(B).  The only question, then, is whether it is consistent with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> for BCRA &#xA7;203 to prohibit WRTL from running these three ads.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>

These cases, however, present the separate question whether &#xA7;203 may constitutionally be applied to these specific ads.  Because BCRA &#xA7;203 burdens political speech, it is subject to strict scrutiny.  See <em>McConnell</em>,<em/>540 U. S., at 205; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/652" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 652</a>,

; <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 252 (plurality opinion); <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 786; <em>Buckley</em>,<em/>424 U. S., at 44&#x96;45.  Under strict scrutiny, the <em>Government</em> must prove that applying BCRA to WRTL&#x92;s ads furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  See <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 786 (&#x93;Especially where, as here, a prohibition is directed at speech itself, and the speech is intimately related to the process of governing, &#x2026; &#x91;the burden is on the government to show the existence of [a compelling] interest&#x92; &#x94; (footnote omitted)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The strict scrutiny analysis is, of course, informed by our precedents.  This Court has already ruled that BCRA survives strict scrutiny to the extent it regulates express advocacy or its functional equivalent.  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 206.  So to the extent the ads in these cases fit this description, the FEC&#x92;s burden is not onerous; all it need do is point to <em>McConnell </em>and explain why it applies here.  If, on the other hand, WRTL&#x92;s ads are <em>not </em>express advocacy or its equivalent, the Government&#x92;s task is more formidable.  It must then demonstrate that banning such ads during the blackout periods is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.  No precedent of this Court has yet reached that conclusion.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC, intervenors, and the dissent below contend that <em>McConnell</em> already established the constitutional test for determining if an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy: whether the ad is intended to influence elections and has that effect.  See, <em>e.g., </em>466 F. Supp. 2d, at 214 (opinion of Roberts, J.).  Here is the relevant portion of our opinion in <em>McConnell</em>:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;[P]laintiffs argue that the justifications that adequately support the regulation of express advocacy do not apply to significant quantities of speech encompassed by the definition of electioneering communications.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;This argument fails to the extent that the issue ads broadcast during the 30- and 60-day periods preceding federal primary and general elections are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  The justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during those periods if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;<em/>540 U. S., at 205&#x96;206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL and the District Court majority, on the other hand, claim that <em>McConnell </em>did not adopt any test as the standard for future as-applied challenges.  We agree.  <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>analysis was grounded in the evidentiary record before the Court.  Two key studies in the <em>McConnell </em>record constituted &#x93;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions in support of their constitutional validity.&#x94;  <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>FEC</em>, 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 307, 308 (DC 2003) (opinion of Henderson, J.) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those studies asked &#x93;student coders&#x94; to separate ads based on whether the students thought the &#x93;purpose&#x94; of the ad was &#x93;to provide information about or urge action on a bill or issue,&#x94; or &#x93;to generate support or opposition for a particular candidate.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 308&#x96;309 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted); see Brief for Appellee 38.  The studies concluded &#x93; &#x91;that BCRA&#x92;s definition of Electioneering Communications accurately captures those ads that <em>have the purpose or effect of supporting candidates for election to office</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When the <em>McConnell</em> Court considered the possible facial overbreadth of &#xA7;203, it looked to the studies in the record analyzing ads broadcast during the blackout periods, and those studies had classified the ads in terms of intent and effect.  The Court&#x92;s assessment was accordingly phrased in the same terms, which the Court regarded as sufficient to conclude, on the record before it, that the plaintiffs had not &#x93;carried their heavy burden of proving&#x94; that &#xA7;203 was facially overbroad and could not be enforced in <em>any </em>circumstances.  540 U. S., at 207.  The Court did not explain that it was adopting a particular test for determining what constituted the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy.  The fact that the student coders who helped develop the evidentiary record before the Court in <em>McConnell</em> looked to intent and effect in doing so, and that the Court dealt with the record on that basis in deciding the facial overbreadth claim, neither compels nor warrants accepting that same standard as the constitutional test for separating, in an as-applied challenge, political speech protected under the

After noting the difficulty of distinguishing between discussion of issues on the one hand and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates on the other, the <em>Buckley </em>Court explained that analyzing the question in terms &#x93; &#x91;of intent and of effect&#x92; &#x94; would afford &#x93; &#x91;no security for free discussion.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id., </em>at 43 (quoting <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Collins</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">     For the reasons regarded as sufficient in <em>Buckley</em>, we decline to adopt a test for as-applied challenges turning on the speaker&#x92;s intent to affect an election.  The test to distinguish constitutionally protected political speech from speech that BCRA may proscribe should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights.  The test should also &#x93;reflec[t] our &#x91;profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 14 (quoting <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Far from serving the values the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> is meant to protect, an intent-based test would chill core political speech by opening the door to a trial on every ad within the terms of &#xA7;203, on the theory that the speaker actually intended to affect an election, no matter how compelling the indications that the ad concerned a pending legislative or policy issue.  No reasonable speaker would choose to run an ad covered by BCRA if its only defense to a criminal prosecution would be that its motives were pure.  An intent-based standard &#x93;blankets with uncertainty whatever may be said,&#x94; and &#x93;offers no security for free discussion.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The FEC does not disagree.  In its brief filed in the first appeal in this litigation, it argued that a &#x93;constitutional standard that turned on the subjective sincerity of a speaker&#x92;s message would likely be incapable of workable application; at a minimum, it would invite costly, fact-dependent litigation.&#x94;  Brief for Appellee in <em>WRTL I</em>, O.

        <p class="bodytext">    In light of these considerations, a court should find that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  Under this test, WRTL&#x92;s three ads are plainly not the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  First, their content is consistent with that of a genuine issue ad: The ads focus on a legislative issue, take a position on the issue, exhort the public to adopt that position, and urge the public to contact public officials with respect to the matter.  Second, their content lacks indicia of express advocacy: The ads do not mention an election, candidacy, political party, or challenger; and they do not take a position on a candidate&#x92;s character, qualifications, or fitness for office.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Despite these characteristics, appellants assert that the content of WRTL&#x92;s ads alone betrays their electioneering nature.  Indeed, the FEC suggests that <em>any </em>ad covered by &#xA7;203 that includes &#x93;an appeal to citizens to contact their elected representative&#x94; is the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of an ad saying defeat or elect that candidate.  Brief for Appellant FEC 31; see Brief for Appellant Sen. John McCain et al<em>. </em>in No. 06&#x96;970, pp. 21&#x96;23 (hereinafter McCain Brief).  We do not agree.  To take just one example, during a blackout period the House considered the proposed Universal National Service Act.  See App. to Brief for American Center for Law and Justice et al<em>.</em> as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> B&#x96;3.  There would be no reason to regard an ad supporting or opposing that Act, and urging citizens to contact their Representative about it, as the equivalent of an ad saying vote for or against the Representative.  Issue advocacy conveys information and educates.  An issue ad&#x92;s impact on an election, if it exists at all, will come only after the voters hear the information and choose&#x97;uninvited by the ad&#x97;to factor it into their voting decisions.<a name="ZO-6ref" href="#ZO-6" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC and intervenors try to turn this difference to their advantage, citing <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s statements &#x93;that the most effective campaign ads, like the most effective commercials for products . . . avoid the [<em>Buckley</em>]<em/>magic words [expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate],&#x94; 540 U. S., at 127, and that advertisers &#x93;would seldom choose to use such words even if permitted,&#x94; <em>id.,</em> at 193.  See McCain Brief<em/>19.  An expert for the FEC in these cases relied on those observations to argue that WRTL&#x92;s ads are especially effective electioneering ads because they are &#x93;subtl[e],&#x94; focusing on issues rather than simply exhorting the electorate to vote against Senator Feingold.  App. 56&#x96;57.  Rephrased a bit, the argument perversely maintains that the <em>less </em>an issue ad resembles express advocacy, the more likely it is to be the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  This &#x93;heads I win, tails you lose&#x94; approach cannot be correct.  It would effectively eliminate 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> protection for genuine issue ads, contrary to our conclusion in <em>WRTL I </em>that as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203 are available, and our assumption in <em>McConnell</em> that &#x93;the interests that justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads,&#x94; 540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  Under appellants&#x92; view, there can be no such thing as a genuine issue ad during the blackout period&#x97;it is simply a very effective electioneering ad.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Looking beyond the content of WRTL&#x92;s ads, the FEC and intervenors argue that several &#x93;contextual&#x94; factors prove that the ads are the equivalent of express advocacy.  First, appellants cite evidence that during the same election cycle, WRTL and its Political Action Committee (PAC) actively opposed Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection and identified filibusters as a campaign issue.  This evidence goes to WRTL&#x92;s subjective intent in running the ads, and we have already explained that WRTL&#x92;s intent is irrelevant in an as-applied challenge.  Evidence of this sort is therefore beside the point, as it should be&#x97;WRTL does not forfeit its right to speak on issues simply because in other aspects of its work it also opposes candidates who are involved with those issues.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Next, the FEC and intervenors seize on the timing of WRTL&#x92;s ads.  They observe that the ads were to be aired near elections but not near actual Senate votes on judicial nominees, and that WRTL did not run the ads after the elections.  To the extent this evidence goes to WRTL&#x92;s subjective intent, it is again irrelevant.  To the extent it nonetheless suggests that the ads should be interpreted as express advocacy, it falls short.  That the ads were run close to an election is unremarkable in a challenge like this.  <em>Every </em>ad covered by BCRA &#xA7;203 will by definition air just before a primary or general election.  If this were enough to prove that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy, then BCRA would be constitutional in all of its applications.  This Court unanimously rejected this contention in <em>WRTL I</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    That the ads were run shortly after the Senate had recessed is likewise unpersuasive.  Members of Congress often return to their districts during recess, precisely to determine the views of their constituents; an ad run at that time may succeed in getting more constituents to contact the Representative while he or she is back home.  In any event, a group can certainly choose to run an issue ad to coincide with public interest rather than a floor vote.  Finally, WRTL did not resume running its ads after the BCRA blackout period because, as it explains, the debate had changed.  Brief for Appellee 16.  The focus of the Senate was on whether a majority would vote to change the Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster&#x97;not whether individual Senators would continue filibustering.  Given this change, WRTL&#x92;s decision not to continue running<span class="softbreak"/>its ads after the blackout period does not support an inference that the ads were the functional equivalent of electioneering.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The last piece of contextual evidence the FEC and intervenors highlight is the ads&#x92; &#x93;specific and repeated cross-reference&#x94; to a website.  Reply Brief for Appellant FEC 15.  In the middle of the website&#x92;s homepage, in large type, were the addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses of Senators Feingold and Kohl.  Wisconsinites who viewed &#x93;Wedding,&#x94; &#x93;Loan,&#x94; or &#x93;Waiting&#x94; and wished to contact their Senators&#x97;as the ads requested&#x97;would be able to obtain the pertinent contact information immediately upon visiting the website.  This is fully consistent with viewing WRTL&#x92;s ads as genuine issue ads.  The website also stated both Wisconsin Senators&#x92; positions on judicial filibusters, and allowed visitors to sign up for &#x93;e-alerts,&#x94; some of which contained exhortations to vote against Senator Feingold.  These details lend the electioneering interpretation of the ads more credence, but again, WRTL&#x92;s participation in express advocacy in other aspects of its work is not a justification for censoring its issue-related speech.  Any express advocacy on the website, already one step removed from the text of the ads themselves, certainly does not render an interpretation of the ads as genuine issue ads unreasonable.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given the standard we have adopted for determining whether an ad is the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy, contextual factors of the sort invoked by appellants should seldom play a significant role in the inquiry.  Courts need not ignore basic background information that may be necessary to put an ad in context&#x97;such as whether an ad &#x93;describes a legislative issue that is either currently the subject of legislative scrutiny or likely to be the subject of such scrutiny in the near future,&#x94; 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 207&#x97;but the need to consider such background should not become an excuse for discovery or a broader inquiry of the sort we have just noted raises 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> concerns.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At best, appellants have shown what we have acknowledged at least since <em>Buckley</em>: that &#x93;the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application.&#x94;  424 U. S., at 42.  Under the test set forth above, that is not enough to establish that the ads can only reasonably be viewed as advocating or opposing a candidate in a federal election.  &#x93;Freedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period.&#x94;  <em>Thornhill</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    At the outset, we reject the contention that issue advocacy may be regulated because express election advocacy may be, and &#x93;the speech involved in so-called issue advocacy is [not] any more core political speech than are words of express advocacy.&#x94;  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 205.  This greater-includes-the-lesser approach is not how strict scrutiny works.  A corporate ad expressing support for the local football team could not be regulated on the ground that such speech is less &#x93;core&#x94; than corporate speech about an election, which we have held may be restricted.  A court applying strict scrutiny must ensure that a compelling interest supports <em>each application</em> of a statute restricting speech.  That a compelling interest justifies restrictions on express advocacy tells us little about whether a compelling interest justifies restrictions on issue advocacy; the <em>McConnell </em>Court itself made just that point.  See 540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  Such a greater-includes-the-lesser argument would dictate that virtually <em>all </em>corporate speech can be suppressed, since few kinds of speech can lay claim to being as central to the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> as campaign speech.  That conclusion is clearly foreclosed by our precedent.  See, <em>e.g.,</em>
            <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 776&#x96;777.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This Court has long recognized &#x93;the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption&#x94; in election campaigns.  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 45.  This interest has been invoked as a reason for upholding <em>contribution</em> limits.  As <em>Buckley </em>explained, &#x93;[t]o the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political <em>quid pro quo</em> from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 26&#x96;27.  We have suggested that this interest might also justify limits on electioneering <em>expenditures</em> because it may be that, in some circumstances, &#x93;large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements as do large contributions.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 45.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em> arguably applied this interest&#x97;which this Court had only assumed could justify regulation of express advocacy&#x97;to ads that were the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy.  See 540 U. S., at 204&#x96;206.  But to justify regulation of WRTL&#x92;s ads, this interest must be stretched yet another step to ads that are <em>not</em> the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Enough is enough.  Issue ads like WRTL&#x92;s are by no means equivalent to contributions, and the <em>quid-pro-quo </em>corruption interest cannot justify regulating them.  To equate WRTL&#x92;s ads with contributions is to ignore their value as political speech.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Appellants argue that an expansive definition of &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; is needed to ensure that issue advocacy does not circumvent the rule against express advocacy, which in turn helps protect against circumvention of the rule against contributions.  Cf. <em>McConnell, supra,</em> at 205 (&#x93;[R]ecent cases have recognized that certain restrictions on corporate electoral involvement permissibly hedge against circumvention of [valid] contribution limits&#x94; (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original)).  But such a prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis approach to regulating expression is not consistent with strict scrutiny.  &#x93;[T]he desire for a bright-line rule . . . hardly constitutes the <em>compelling </em>state interest necessary to justify any infringement on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> freedom.&#x94;  <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 263.  See <em>Free Speech Coalition</em>, 535 U. S., at 255 (&#x93;The Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech&#x94;); <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 44 (expenditure limitations &#x93;cannot be sustained simply by invoking the interest in maximizing the effectiveness of the less intrusive contribution limitations&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A second possible compelling interest recognized by this Court lies in addressing a &#x93;different type of corruption in the political arena: the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x94;  <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660.  <em>Austin </em>invoked this interest to uphold a state statute making it a felony for corporations to use treasury funds for independent expenditures on express election advocacy.  <em>Id.,</em> at 654&#x96;655.  <em>McConnell</em> also relied on this interest in upholding regulation not just of express advocacy, but also its &#x93;functional equivalent.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 205&#x96;206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These cases did not suggest, however, that the interest in combating &#x93;a different type of corruption&#x94; extended beyond campaign speech.  Quite the contrary.  Two of the Justices who joined the 6-to-3 majority in <em>Austin</em> relied, in upholding the constitutionality of the ban on campaign speech, on the fact that corporations retained freedom to speak on issues as distinct from election campaigns.  See 494 U. S., at 675&#x96;678 (Brennan, J., concurring) (describing fact that campaign speech ban &#x93;does not regulate corporate expenditures in referenda or other corporate expression&#x94; as &#x93;reflect[ing] the requirements of our decisions&#x94;); <em>id.,</em> at 678 (<span class="smallcaps">Stevens</span>, J., concurring) (&#x93;[T]here is a vast difference between lobbying and debating public issues on the one hand, and political campaigns for election to public office on the other&#x94;).  The <em>McConnell </em>Court similarly was willing to &#x93;assume that the interests that justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  And our decision in <em>WRTL I </em>reinforced the validity of that assumption by holding that BCRA &#xA7;203 is susceptible to as-applied challenges.  546 U. S., at 411&#x96;412.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Accepting the notion that a ban on campaign speech could also embrace issue advocacy would call into question our holding in <em>Bellotti</em> that the corporate identity of a speaker does not strip corporations of all free speech rights.  435 U. S., at 778.  It would be a constitutional &#x93;bait and switch&#x94; to conclude that corporate campaign speech may be banned in part <em>because </em>corporate issue advocacy is not, and then assert that corporate issue advocacy may be banned as well, pursuant to the same asserted compelling interest, through a broad conception of what constitutes the functional equivalent of campaign speech, or by relying on the inability to distinguish campaign speech from issue advocacy.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC and intervenors do not argue that the <em>Austin</em> interest justifies regulating genuine issue ads.  Instead, they focus on establishing that WRTL&#x92;s ads are the functional equivalent of express advocacy&#x97;a contention we have already rejected.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> opinions, we have gotten this far in the analysis without quoting the Amendment itself: &#x93;Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.&#x94;  The Framers&#x92; actual words put these cases in proper perspective.  Our jurisprudence over the past 216 years has rejected an absolutist interpretation of those words, but when it comes to drawing difficult lines in the area of pure political speech&#x97;between what is protected and what the Government may ban&#x97;it is worth recalling the language we are applying.  <em>McConnell</em> held that express advocacy of a candidate or his opponent by a corporation shortly before an election may be prohibited, along with the functional equivalent of such express advocacy.  We have no occasion to revisit that determination today.  But when it comes to defining what speech qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy subject to such a ban&#x97;the issue we <em>do</em> have to decide&#x97;we give the benefit of the doubt to speech, not censorship.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>&#x92;s command that &#x93;Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech&#x94; demands at least that.</p>

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-4" href="#ZO-4ref">4</a> This is particularly true given that the methodology, data, and conclusions of the two studies were the subject of serious dispute among the District Court judges.  Compare McConnell v. FEC, 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 307&#x96;312 (DC 2003) (opinion of Henderson, J.) (stating that the studies were flawed and of limited evidentiary value), with id., at 585, 583&#x96;588 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (finding the studies generally credible, but stating that &#x93;I am troubled by the fact that coders in both studies were asked questions regarding their own perceptions of the advertisements&#x92; purposes, and that [some of] these perceptions were later recoded&#x94; by study supervisors).  Nothing in this Court&#x92;s opinion in McConnell suggests it was resolving the sharp disagreements about the evidentiary record in this respect.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-5" href="#ZO-5ref">5</a> Consider what happened in these cases.  The District Court permitted extensive discovery on the assumption that WRTL&#x92;s intent was relevant.  As a result, the defendants deposed WRTL&#x92;s executive director, its legislative director, its political action committee director, its lead communications consultant, and one of its fundraisers.  WRTL also had to turn over many documents related to its operations, plans, and finances.  Such litigation constitutes a severe burden on political speech.
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-6" href="#ZO-6ref">6</a> For these reasons, we cannot agree with Justice Souter&#x92;s assertion that &#x93;anyone who heard the Feingold ads &#x2026; would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.&#x94;  Post, at 23.  The dissent supports this assertion by likening WRTL&#x92;s ads to the &#x93;Jane Doe&#x94; example identified in McConnell v. Federal Election Comm&#x92;n, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/540/93" class="subref" title="subref">540 U. S. 93</a> (2003)
.  But that ad &#x93;condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue.&#x94;  Post, at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).  WRTL&#x92;s ads do not do so; they instead take a position on the filibuster issue and exhort constituents to contact Senators Feingold and Kohl to advance that position.  Indeed, one would not even know from the ads whether Senator Feingold supported or opposed filibusters.  Justice Souter is confident Wisconsinites independently knew Senator Feingold&#x92;s position on filibusters, but we think that confidence misplaced.  A prominent study found, for example, that during the 2000 election cycle, 85 percent of respondents to a survey were not even able to name at least one candidate for the House of Representatives in their own district.  See Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, American National Election Study, 2000: Pre- and Post-Election Survey 243 (N.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-7" href="#ZO-7ref">7</a> Justice Scalia thinks our test impermissibly vague.  See post, at 11&#x96;12 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  As should be evident, we agree with Justice Scalia on the imperative for clarity in this area; that is why our test affords protection unless an ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  It is why we emphasize that (1) there can be no free-ranging intent-and-effect test; (2) there generally should be no discovery or inquiry into the sort of &#x93;contextual&#x94; factors highlighted by the FEC and intervenors; (3) discussion of issues cannot be banned merely because the issues might be relevant to an election; and (4) in a debatable case, the tie is resolved in favor of protecting speech.  And keep in mind this test is only triggered if the speech meets the brightline requirements of BCRA &#xA7;203 in the first place.  Justice Scalia&#x92;s criticism of our test is all the more confusing because he accepts WRTL&#x92;s proposed three-prong test as &#x93;clear.&#x94;  Post, at 17.  We do not think our test any vaguer than WRTL&#x92;s, and it is more protective of political speech.


Justice Scalia also asserts that our test conflicts with Buckley v. Valeo, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
 (per curiam).  Post, at 13&#x96;16.  The Buckley Court confronted a statute restricting &#x93;any expenditure &#x2026; relative to a clearly identified candidate.&#x94;  424 U. S., at 42 (internal quotation marks omitted).  To avoid vagueness concerns, this Court first narrowed the statute to cover only expenditures expressly &#x93;advocating the election or defeat of a candidate&#x94;&#x97;using the so-called &#x93;magic words&#x94; of express advocacy.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court then proceeded to strike down the newly narrowed statute under strict scrutiny on the ground that its reach was not broad enough.  Id., at 44.  From this, Justice Scalia concludes that &#x93;[i]f a permissible test short of the magic-words test existed, Buckley would surely have adopted it.&#x94;  Post, at 14.  We are not so sure.  The question in Buckley was how a particular statutory provision could be construed to avoid vagueness concerns, not what the constitutional standard for clarity was in the abstract, divorced from specific statutory language.  Buckley&#x92;s intermediate step of statutory construction on the way to its constitutional holding does not dictate a constitutional test.  The Buckley Court&#x92;s &#x93;express advocacy restriction was an endpoint of statutory interpretation, not a first principle of constitutional law.&#x94;  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 190.  And despite Justice Scalia&#x92;s claim to the contrary, our citation of Buckley along with other decisions in rejecting an intent-and-effect test does not force us to adopt (or reject) Buckley&#x92;s statutory construction as a constitutional test.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-8" href="#ZO-8ref">8</a> Nothing in McConnell&#x92;s statement that the &#x93;vast majority&#x94; of issue ads broadcast in the periods preceding federal elections had an &#x93;electioneering purpose&#x94; forecloses this conclusion.  540 U. S., at 206.  Courts do not resolve unspecified as-applied challenges in the course of resolving a facial attack, so McConnell could not have settled the issue we address today.  See Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">22</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;The fact that [a law] is capable of valid applications does not necessarily mean that it is valid as applied to these litigants&#x94;).  Indeed, WRTL I confirmed as much.  546 U. S., at 411&#x96;412.  By the same token, in deciding this as-applied challenge, we have no occasion to revisit McConnell&#x92;s conclusion that the statute is not facially overbroad.


The &#x93;vast majority&#x94; language, moreover, is beside the point.  The McConnell Court did not find that a &#x93;vast majority&#x94; of the issue ads considered were the functional equivalent of direct advocacy.  Rather, it found that such ads had an &#x93;electioneering purpose.&#x94;  For the reasons we have explained, &#x93;purpose&#x94; is not the appropriate test for distinguishing between genuine issue ads and the functional equivalent of express campaign advocacy.  See supra, at 14&#x96;15.  In addition, the &#x93;vast majority&#x94; statement was not necessary to the Court&#x92;s facial holding in McConnell.  The standard required for a statute to survive an overbreadth challenge is not that the &#x93;vast majority&#x94; of a statute&#x92;s applications be legitimate.  &#x93;[B]road language . . . unnecessary to the Court&#x92;s decision &#x2026; cannot be considered binding authority.&#x94;  Kastigar v.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-9" href="#ZO-9ref">9</a> The dissent stresses a number of points that, while not central to our decision, nevertheless merit a response.  First, the dissent overstates its case when it asserts that the &#x93;PAC alternative&#x94; gives corporations a constitutionally sufficient outlet to speak.  See post, at 30.  PACs impose well-documented and onerous burdens, particularly on small nonprofits.  See MCFL, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/479/238" class="subref" title="subref">479 U. S. 238</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">253</a>&#x96;255 (1986)
 (plurality opinion).  McConnell did conclude that segregated funds &#x93;provid[e] corporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy&#x94; and its functional equivalent, 540 U. S., at 203, but that holding did not extend beyond functional equivalents&#x97;and if it did, the PAC option would justify regulation of all corporate speech, a proposition we have rejected, see Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 777&#x96;778.  Second, the response that a speaker should just take out a newspaper ad, or use a website, rather than complain that it cannot speak through a broadcast communication, see post, at 18&#x96;19, 33, is too glib.  Even assuming for the sake of argument that the possibility of using a different medium of communication has relevance in determining the permissibility of a limitation on speech, newspaper ads and websites are not reasonable alternatives to broadcast speech in terms of impact and effectiveness.  See McConnell v. FEC, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 569&#x96;573, 646 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.).  Third, we disagree with the dissent&#x92;s view that corporations can still speak by changing what they say to avoid mentioning candidates, post, at 30&#x96;31.  That argument is akin to telling Cohen that he cannot wear his jacket because he is free to wear one that says &#x93;I disagree with the draft,&#x94; cf. Cohen v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/15" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 15</a> (1971)
, or telling 44 Liquormart that it can advertise so long as it avoids mentioning prices, cf. 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/484" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 484</a> (1996)
.  Such notions run afoul of &#x93;the fundamental rule of protection under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.&#x94;  Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.,

They assert that &#x93;[s]peech by nonprofit advocacy groups on behalf of their members does not &#x91;corrupt&#x92; candidates or &#x91;distort&#x92; the political marketplace,&#x94; and that &#x93;[n]onprofit advocacy groups funded by individuals are readily distinguished from for-profit corporations funded by general treasuries.&#x94;  Brief for Family Research Council et al. as Amici Curiae 3, 4.

In <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/540/93" class="subref" title="subref">540 U. S. 93</a> (2003)
, this Court considered whether &#xA7;203 was facially overbroad under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> because it captured within its reach not only campaign speech, or &#x93;express advocacy,&#x94; but also speech about public issues more generally, or &#x93;issue advocacy,&#x94; that mentions a candidate for federal office.  The Court concluded that there was no overbreadth concern to the extent the speech in question was the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express campaign speech.  <em>Id.</em>, at 204&#x96;205, 206.  On the other hand, the Court &#x93;assume[d]&#x94; that the interests it had found to &#x93;justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads.&#x94;  <em>Id., </em>at 206, n. 88.  The Court nonetheless determined that &#xA7;203 was not facially overbroad.

        <p class="bodytext">    Last Term, we reversed a lower court ruling, arising in the same litigation before us now, that our decision in <em>McConnell</em> left &#x93;no room&#x94; for as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203.

        <p class="bodytext">    We now confront such an as-applied challenge.

Our development of the law in this area requires us, however, to draw such a line, because we have recognized that the interests held to justify the regulation of campaign speech and its &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; &#x93;might not apply&#x94; to the regulation of issue advocacy.  <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 206, and n. 88.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    BCRA significantly cut back on corporations&#x92; ability to engage in political speech.  BCRA &#xA7;203, at issue in these cases, makes it a crime for any labor union or incorporated entity&#x97;whether the United Steelworkers, the American Civil Liberties Union, or General Motors&#x97;to use its general treasury funds to pay for any &#x93;electioneering communication.&#x94;  &#xA7;441b(b)(2) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  BCRA&#x92;s definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; is clear and expansive.

        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL planned on running &#x93;Wedding,&#x94; &#x93;Waiting,&#x94; and &#x93;Loan&#x94; throughout August 2004 and financing the ads with funds from its general treasury.  It recognized, however, that as of August 15, 30 days prior to the Wisconsin primary, the ads would be illegal &#x93;electioneering communication[s]&#x94; under BCRA &#xA7;203.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Believing that it nonetheless possessed a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to broadcast these ads, WRTL filed suit against the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on July 28, 2004, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief before a three-judge District Court.  See note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/437h.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;437h</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV); 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2284.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;2284</a>.  WRTL alleged that BCRA&#x92;s prohibition on the use of corporate treasury funds for &#x93;electioneering communication[s]&#x94; as defined in the Act is unconstitutional as applied to &#x93;Wedding,&#x94; &#x93;Loan,&#x94; and &#x93;Waiting,&#x94; as well as any materially similar ads it might seek to run in the future.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Just before the BCRA blackout period was to begin, the District Court denied a preliminary injunction, concluding that &#x93;the reasoning of the <em>McConnell</em> Court leaves no room for the kind of &#x91;as applied&#x92; challenge WRTL propounds before us.&#x94;  App. to Juris. Statement 52a.  In response to this ruling, WRTL did not run its ads during the blackout period.  The District Court subsequently dismissed WRTL&#x92;s complaint.  See <em>id.,</em> at 47a&#x96;48a (&#x93;WRTL&#x92;s &#x91;as-applied&#x92; challenge to BCRA [&#xA7;203] is foreclosed by the Supreme Court&#x92;s decision in <em>McConnell</em>&#x94;).  On appeal, we vacated the District Court&#x92;s judgment, holding that <em>McConnell</em> &#x93;did not purport to resolve future as-applied challenges&#x94; to BCRA &#xA7;203, and remanded &#x93;for the District Court to consider the merits of WRTL&#x92;s as-applied challenge in the first instance.&#x94;  <em>WRTL I</em>, 546 U. S., at 412.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On remand, after allowing four Members of Congress to intervene as defendants, the three-judge District Court granted summary judgment for WRTL, holding BCRA &#xA7;203 unconstitutional as applied to the three advertisements WRTL planned to run during the 2004 blackout period.  The District Court first found adjudication of the dispute not barred by mootness because the controversy was &#x93; &#x91;capable of repetition, yet evading review.&#x92; &#x94;  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 202.  Turning to the merits, the court began by noting that under <em>McConnell</em>, BCRA could constitutionally proscribe &#x93;express advocacy&#x94;&#x97;defined as ads that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office&#x97;and the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of such advocacy.  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 204.  Stating that it was limiting its inquiry to &#x93;language within the four corners&#x94; of the ads, <em>id.,</em> at 207, the District Court concluded that the ads were <em>not</em> express advocacy or its functional equivalent, but instead &#x93;genuine issue ads.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 205&#x96;208.  Then, reaching a question &#x93;left open in <em>McConnell</em>,&#x94; the court held that no compelling interest justified BCRA&#x92;s regulation of genuine issue ads such as those WRTL sought to run.  <em>Id., </em>at 208&#x96;210.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    One judge dissented, contending that the majority&#x92;s &#x93;plain facial analysis of the text in WRTL&#x92;s 2004 advertisements&#x94; ignored &#x93;the context in which the text was developed.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 210 (opinion of Roberts, J.).  In that judge&#x92;s view, a contextual analysis of the ads revealed &#x93;deep factual rifts between the parties concerning the purpose and intended effects of the ads&#x94; such that neither side was entitled to summary judgment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 210, 211.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC and intervenors filed separate notices of appeal and jurisdictional statements.  We consolidated the two appeals and set the matter for briefing and argument, postponing further consideration of jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits.  549 U. S. ___ (2007).</p>

.  Based on these principles, the FEC argues (though the intervenors do not) that these cases are moot because the 2004 election has passed and WRTL &#x93;does not assert any continuing interest in running [its three] advertisements, nor does it identify any reason to believe that a significant dispute over Senate filibusters of judicial nominees will occur in the foreseeable future.&#x94;  Brief for Appellant FEC 21.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    As the District Court found, it would be &#x93;entirely unreasonable . . . to expect that [WRTL] could have obtained complete judicial review of its claims in time for it to air its ads&#x94; during the BCRA blackout periods.  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 202.  The FEC contends that the 2-year window between elections provides ample time for parties to litigate their rights before each BCRA blackout period.  But groups like WRTL cannot predict what issues will be matters of public concern during a future blackout period.  In these cases, WRTL had no way of knowing well in advance that it would want to run ads on judicial filibusters during the BCRA blackout period.

Our cases find the same controversy sufficiently likely to recur when a party has a reasonable expectation that it &#x93;will again be subjected to the alleged illegality,&#x94; <em>Lyons</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 109, or &#x93;will be subject to the threat of prosecution&#x94; under the challenged law, <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 774&#x96;775 (citing <em>Weinstein</em> v. <em>Bradford</em>,

 (<em>per curiam</em>)).  The FEC argues that in order to prove likely recurrence of the same controversy, WRTL must establish that it will run ads in the future sharing all &#x93;the characteristics that the district court deemed legally relevant.&#x94;  Brief for Appellant FEC 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC asks for too much.  We have recognized that the &#x93; &#x91;capable of repetition, yet evading review&#x92; doctrine, in the context of election cases, is appropriate when there are &#x91;as applied&#x92; challenges as well as in the more typical case involving only facial attacks.&#x94;  <em>Storer</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/415/724" class="subref" title="subref">415 U. S. 724</a>, n. 8 (1974).  Requiring repetition of every &#x93;legally relevant&#x94; characteristic of an as-applied challenge&#x97;down to the last detail&#x97;would effectively overrule this statement by making this exception unavailable for virtually all as-applied challenges.  History repeats itself, but not at the level of specificity demanded by the FEC.  Here, WRTL credibly claimed that it planned on running &#x93; &#x91;materially similar&#x92; &#x94; future targeted broadcast ads mentioning a candidate within the blackout period, 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 197, and there is no reason to believe that the FEC will &#x93;refrain from prosecuting violations&#x94; of BCRA, <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 775.  Under the circumstances, particularly where WRTL sought another preliminary injunction based on an ad it planned to run during the 2006 blackout period, see 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 203, n. 15, we hold that there exists a reasonable expectation that the same controversy involving the same party will recur.  We have jurisdiction to decide these cases.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL rightly concedes that its ads are prohibited by BCRA &#xA7;203.  Each ad clearly identifies Senator Feingold, who was running (unopposed) in the Wisconsin Democratic primary on September 14, 2004, and each ad would have been &#x93;targeted to the relevant electorate,&#x94; see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_C" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(C)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV), during the BCRA blackout period.  WRTL further concedes that its ads do not fit under any of BCRA&#x92;s exceptions to the term &#x93;electioneering communication.&#x94;  See &#xA7;434(f)(3)(B).  The only question, then, is whether it is consistent with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> for BCRA &#xA7;203 to prohibit WRTL from running these three ads.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Appellants contend that WRTL should be required to demonstrate that BCRA is unconstitutional as applied to the ads.  Reply Brief for Appellant Sen. John McCain et al. in No. 06&#x96;970, p. 5, n. 4; Brief for Appellant FEC 34.  After all, appellants reason, <em>McConnell</em> already held that BCRA &#xA7;203 was facially valid.  These cases, however, present the separate question whether &#xA7;203 may constitutionally be applied to these specific ads.  Because BCRA &#xA7;203 burdens political speech, it is subject to strict scrutiny.  See <em>McConnell</em>,<em/>540 U. S., at 205; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/652" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 652</a>,

; <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 252 (plurality opinion); <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 786; <em>Buckley</em>,<em/>424 U. S., at 44&#x96;45.  Under strict scrutiny, the <em>Government</em> must prove that applying BCRA to WRTL&#x92;s ads furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  See <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 786 (&#x93;Especially where, as here, a prohibition is directed at speech itself, and the speech is intimately related to the process of governing, &#x2026; &#x91;the burden is on the government to show the existence of [a compelling] interest&#x92; &#x94; (footnote omitted)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The strict scrutiny analysis is, of course, informed by our precedents.  This Court has already ruled that BCRA survives strict scrutiny to the extent it regulates express advocacy or its functional equivalent.  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 206.  So to the extent the ads in these cases fit this description, the FEC&#x92;s burden is not onerous; all it need do is point to <em>McConnell </em>and explain why it applies here.  If, on the other hand, WRTL&#x92;s ads are <em>not </em>express advocacy or its equivalent, the Government&#x92;s task is more formidable.  It must then demonstrate that banning such ads during the blackout periods is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.  No precedent of this Court has yet reached that conclusion.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC, intervenors, and the dissent below contend that <em>McConnell</em> already established the constitutional test for determining if an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy: whether the ad is intended to influence elections and has that effect.  See, <em>e.g., </em>466 F. Supp. 2d, at 214 (opinion of Roberts, J.).  Here is the relevant portion of our opinion in <em>McConnell</em>:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;[P]laintiffs argue that the justifications that adequately support the regulation of express advocacy do not apply to significant quantities of speech encompassed by the definition of electioneering communications.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;This argument fails to the extent that the issue ads broadcast during the 30- and 60-day periods preceding federal primary and general elections are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  The justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during those periods if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;<em/>540 U. S., at 205&#x96;206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL and the District Court majority, on the other hand, claim that <em>McConnell </em>did not adopt any test as the standard for future as-applied challenges.  We agree.  <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>analysis was grounded in the evidentiary record before the Court.  Two key studies in the <em>McConnell </em>record constituted &#x93;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions in support of their constitutional validity.&#x94;  <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>FEC</em>, 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 307, 308 (DC 2003) (opinion of Henderson, J.) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those studies asked &#x93;student coders&#x94; to separate ads based on whether the students thought the &#x93;purpose&#x94; of the ad was &#x93;to provide information about or urge action on a bill or issue,&#x94; or &#x93;to generate support or opposition for a particular candidate.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 308&#x96;309 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted); see Brief for Appellee 38.  The studies concluded &#x93; &#x91;that BCRA&#x92;s definition of Electioneering Communications accurately captures those ads that <em>have the purpose or effect of supporting candidates for election to office</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When the <em>McConnell</em> Court considered the possible facial overbreadth of &#xA7;203, it looked to the studies in the record analyzing ads broadcast during the blackout periods, and those studies had classified the ads in terms of intent and effect.  The Court&#x92;s assessment was accordingly phrased in the same terms, which the Court regarded as sufficient to conclude, on the record before it, that the plaintiffs had not &#x93;carried their heavy burden of proving&#x94; that &#xA7;203 was facially overbroad and could not be enforced in <em>any </em>circumstances.  540 U. S., at 207.  The Court did not explain that it was adopting a particular test for determining what constituted the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy.  The fact that the student coders who helped develop the evidentiary record before the Court in <em>McConnell</em> looked to intent and effect in doing so, and that the Court dealt with the record on that basis in deciding the facial overbreadth claim, neither compels nor warrants accepting that same standard as the constitutional test for separating, in an as-applied challenge, political speech protected under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> from that which may be banned.<a name="ZO-4ref" href="#ZO-4" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    More importantly, this Court in <em>Buckley</em> had already rejected an intent-and-effect test for distinguishing between discussions of issues and candidates.  See 424 U. S., at 43&#x96;44.  After noting the difficulty of distinguishing between discussion of issues on the one hand and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates on the other, the <em>Buckley </em>Court explained that analyzing the question in terms &#x93; &#x91;of intent and of effect&#x92; &#x94; would afford &#x93; &#x91;no security for free discussion.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id., </em>at 43 (quoting <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Collins</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/516" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 516</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">535</a> (1945)
).  It therefore rejected such an approach, and<em> McConnell </em>did not purport to overrule <em>Buckley</em> on this point&#x97;or even address what <em>Buckley </em>had to say on the subject.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">     For the reasons regarded as sufficient in <em>Buckley</em>, we decline to adopt a test for as-applied challenges turning on the speaker&#x92;s intent to affect an election.  The test to distinguish constitutionally protected political speech from speech that BCRA may proscribe should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights.  The test should also &#x93;reflec[t] our &#x91;profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 14 (quoting <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>,

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> is meant to protect, an intent-based test would chill core political speech by opening the door to a trial on every ad within the terms of &#xA7;203, on the theory that the speaker actually intended to affect an election, no matter how compelling the indications that the ad concerned a pending legislative or policy issue.  No reasonable speaker would choose to run an ad covered by BCRA if its only defense to a criminal prosecution would be that its motives were pure.

The FEC does not disagree.  In its brief filed in the first appeal in this litigation, it argued that a &#x93;constitutional standard that turned on the subjective sincerity of a speaker&#x92;s message would likely be incapable of workable application; at a minimum, it would invite costly, fact-dependent litigation.&#x94;  Brief for Appellee in <em>WRTL I</em>, O.

        <p class="bodytext">    In light of these considerations, a court should find that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  Under this test, WRTL&#x92;s three ads are plainly not the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  First, their content is consistent with that of a genuine issue ad: The ads focus on a legislative issue, take a position on the issue, exhort the public to adopt that position, and urge the public to contact public officials with respect to the matter.  Second, their content lacks indicia of express advocacy: The ads do not mention an election, candidacy, political party, or challenger; and they do not take a position on a candidate&#x92;s character, qualifications, or fitness for office.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Despite these characteristics, appellants assert that the content of WRTL&#x92;s ads alone betrays their electioneering nature.  Indeed, the FEC suggests that <em>any </em>ad covered by &#xA7;203 that includes &#x93;an appeal to citizens to contact their elected representative&#x94; is the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of an ad saying defeat or elect that candidate.  Brief for Appellant FEC 31; see Brief for Appellant Sen. John McCain et al<em>. </em>in No. 06&#x96;970, pp. 21&#x96;23 (hereinafter McCain Brief).  We do not agree.  To take just one example, during a blackout period the House considered the proposed Universal National Service Act.  See App. to Brief for American Center for Law and Justice et al<em>.</em> as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> B&#x96;3.  There would be no reason to regard an ad supporting or opposing that Act, and urging citizens to contact their Representative about it, as the equivalent of an ad saying vote for or against the Representative.  Issue advocacy conveys information and educates.  An issue ad&#x92;s impact on an election, if it exists at all, will come only after the voters hear the information and choose&#x97;uninvited by the ad&#x97;to factor it into their voting decisions.<a name="ZO-6ref" href="#ZO-6" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC and intervenors try to turn this difference to their advantage, citing <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s statements &#x93;that the most effective campaign ads, like the most effective commercials for products . . . avoid the [<em>Buckley</em>]<em/>magic words [expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate],&#x94; 540 U. S., at 127, and that advertisers &#x93;would seldom choose to use such words even if permitted,&#x94; <em>id.,</em> at 193.  See McCain Brief<em/>19.  An expert for the FEC in these cases relied on those observations to argue that WRTL&#x92;s ads are especially effective electioneering ads because they are &#x93;subtl[e],&#x94; focusing on issues rather than simply exhorting the electorate to vote against Senator Feingold.  App. 56&#x96;57.  Rephrased a bit, the argument perversely maintains that the <em>less </em>an issue ad resembles express advocacy, the more likely it is to be the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  This &#x93;heads I win, tails you lose&#x94; approach cannot be correct.  It would effectively eliminate 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> protection for genuine issue ads, contrary to our conclusion in <em>WRTL I </em>that as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203 are available, and our assumption in <em>McConnell</em> that &#x93;the interests that justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads,&#x94; 540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  Under appellants&#x92; view, there can be no such thing as a genuine issue ad during the blackout period&#x97;it is simply a very effective electioneering ad.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Looking beyond the content of WRTL&#x92;s ads, the FEC and intervenors argue that several &#x93;contextual&#x94; factors prove that the ads are the equivalent of express advocacy.  First, appellants cite evidence that during the same election cycle, WRTL and its Political Action Committee (PAC) actively opposed Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection and identified filibusters as a campaign issue.  This evidence goes to WRTL&#x92;s subjective intent in running the ads, and we have already explained that WRTL&#x92;s intent is irrelevant in an as-applied challenge.  Evidence of this sort is therefore beside the point, as it should be&#x97;WRTL does not forfeit its right to speak on issues simply because in other aspects of its work it also opposes candidates who are involved with those issues.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Next, the FEC and intervenors seize on the timing of WRTL&#x92;s ads.  They observe that the ads were to be aired near elections but not near actual Senate votes on judicial nominees, and that WRTL did not run the ads after the elections.  To the extent this evidence goes to WRTL&#x92;s subjective intent, it is again irrelevant.  To the extent it nonetheless suggests that the ads should be interpreted as express advocacy, it falls short.  That the ads were run close to an election is unremarkable in a challenge like this.  <em>Every </em>ad covered by BCRA &#xA7;203 will by definition air just before a primary or general election.  If this were enough to prove that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy, then BCRA would be constitutional in all of its applications.  This Court unanimously rejected this contention in <em>WRTL I</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    That the ads were run shortly after the Senate had recessed is likewise unpersuasive.  Members of Congress often return to their districts during recess, precisely to determine the views of their constituents; an ad run at that time may succeed in getting more constituents to contact the Representative while he or she is back home.  In any event, a group can certainly choose to run an issue ad to coincide with public interest rather than a floor vote.  Finally, WRTL did not resume running its ads after the BCRA blackout period because, as it explains, the debate had changed.  Brief for Appellee 16.  The focus of the Senate was on whether a majority would vote to change the Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster&#x97;not whether individual Senators would continue filibustering.  Given this change, WRTL&#x92;s decision not to continue running<span class="softbreak"/>its ads after the blackout period does not support an inference that the ads were the functional equivalent of electioneering.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The last piece of contextual evidence the FEC and intervenors highlight is the ads&#x92; &#x93;specific and repeated cross-reference&#x94; to a website.  Reply Brief for Appellant FEC 15.  In the middle of the website&#x92;s homepage, in large type, were the addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses of Senators Feingold and Kohl.  Wisconsinites who viewed &#x93;Wedding,&#x94; &#x93;Loan,&#x94; or &#x93;Waiting&#x94; and wished to contact their Senators&#x97;as the ads requested&#x97;would be able to obtain the pertinent contact information immediately upon visiting the website.  This is fully consistent with viewing WRTL&#x92;s ads as genuine issue ads.  The website also stated both Wisconsin Senators&#x92; positions on judicial filibusters, and allowed visitors to sign up for &#x93;e-alerts,&#x94; some of which contained exhortations to vote against Senator Feingold.  These details lend the electioneering interpretation of the ads more credence, but again, WRTL&#x92;s participation in express advocacy in other aspects of its work is not a justification for censoring its issue-related speech.  Any express advocacy on the website, already one step removed from the text of the ads themselves, certainly does not render an interpretation of the ads as genuine issue ads unreasonable.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given the standard we have adopted for determining whether an ad is the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy, contextual factors of the sort invoked by appellants should seldom play a significant role in the inquiry.  Courts need not ignore basic background information that may be necessary to put an ad in context&#x97;such as whether an ad &#x93;describes a legislative issue that is either currently the subject of legislative scrutiny or likely to be the subject of such scrutiny in the near future,&#x94; 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 207&#x97;but the need to consider such background should not become an excuse for discovery or a broader inquiry of the sort we have just noted raises

        <p class="bodytext">    At best, appellants have shown what we have acknowledged at least since <em>Buckley</em>: that &#x93;the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application.&#x94;  424 U. S., at 42.  Under the test set forth above, that is not enough to establish that the ads can only reasonably be viewed as advocating or opposing a candidate in a federal election.  &#x93;Freedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period.&#x94;  <em>Thornhill</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    At the outset, we reject the contention that issue advocacy may be regulated because express election advocacy may be, and &#x93;the speech involved in so-called issue advocacy is [not] any more core political speech than are words of express advocacy.&#x94;  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 205.  This greater-includes-the-lesser approach is not how strict scrutiny works.  A corporate ad expressing support for the local football team could not be regulated on the ground that such speech is less &#x93;core&#x94; than corporate speech about an election, which we have held may be restricted.  A court applying strict scrutiny must ensure that a compelling interest supports <em>each application</em> of a statute restricting speech.  That a compelling interest justifies restrictions on express advocacy tells us little about whether a compelling interest justifies restrictions on issue advocacy; the <em>McConnell </em>Court itself made just that point.  See 540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  Such a greater-includes-the-lesser argument would dictate that virtually <em>all </em>corporate speech can be suppressed, since few kinds of speech can lay claim to being as central to the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> as campaign speech.  That conclusion is clearly foreclosed by our precedent.  See, <em>e.g.,</em>
            <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 776&#x96;777.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This Court has long recognized &#x93;the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption&#x94; in election campaigns.  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 45.  This interest has been invoked as a reason for upholding <em>contribution</em> limits.  As <em>Buckley </em>explained, &#x93;[t]o the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political <em>quid pro quo</em> from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 26&#x96;27.  We have suggested that this interest might also justify limits on electioneering <em>expenditures</em> because it may be that, in some circumstances, &#x93;large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements as do large contributions.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 45.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em> arguably applied this interest&#x97;which this Court had only assumed could justify regulation of express advocacy&#x97;to ads that were the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy.  See 540 U. S., at 204&#x96;206.  But to justify regulation of WRTL&#x92;s ads, this interest must be stretched yet another step to ads that are <em>not</em> the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Enough is enough.  Issue ads like WRTL&#x92;s are by no means equivalent to contributions, and the <em>quid-pro-quo </em>corruption interest cannot justify regulating them.  To equate WRTL&#x92;s ads with contributions is to ignore their value as political speech.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Appellants argue that an expansive definition of &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; is needed to ensure that issue advocacy does not circumvent the rule against express advocacy, which in turn helps protect against circumvention of the rule against contributions.  Cf. <em>McConnell, supra,</em> at 205 (&#x93;[R]ecent cases have recognized that certain restrictions on corporate electoral involvement permissibly hedge against circumvention of [valid] contribution limits&#x94; (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original)).  But such a prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis approach to regulating expression is not consistent with strict scrutiny.  &#x93;[T]he desire for a bright-line rule . . . hardly constitutes the <em>compelling </em>state interest necessary to justify any infringement on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> freedom.&#x94;  <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 263.  See <em>Free Speech Coalition</em>, 535 U. S., at 255 (&#x93;The Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech&#x94;); <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 44 (expenditure limitations &#x93;cannot be sustained simply by invoking the interest in maximizing the effectiveness of the less intrusive contribution limitations&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A second possible compelling interest recognized by this Court lies in addressing a &#x93;different type of corruption in the political arena: the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x94;  <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660.  <em>Austin </em>invoked this interest to uphold a state statute making it a felony for corporations to use treasury funds for independent expenditures on express election advocacy.  <em>Id.,</em> at 654&#x96;655.  <em>McConnell</em> also relied on this interest in upholding regulation not just of express advocacy, but also its &#x93;functional equivalent.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 205&#x96;206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These cases did not suggest, however, that the interest in combating &#x93;a different type of corruption&#x94; extended beyond campaign speech.  Quite the contrary.  Two of the Justices who joined the 6-to-3 majority in <em>Austin</em> relied, in upholding the constitutionality of the ban on campaign speech, on the fact that corporations retained freedom to speak on issues as distinct from election campaigns.  See 494 U. S., at 675&#x96;678 (Brennan, J., concurring) (describing fact that campaign speech ban &#x93;does not regulate corporate expenditures in referenda or other corporate expression&#x94; as &#x93;reflect[ing] the requirements of our decisions&#x94;); <em>id.,</em> at 678 (<span class="smallcaps">Stevens</span>, J., concurring) (&#x93;[T]here is a vast difference between lobbying and debating public issues on the one hand, and political campaigns for election to public office on the other&#x94;).  The <em>McConnell </em>Court similarly was willing to &#x93;assume that the interests that justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  And our decision in <em>WRTL I </em>reinforced the validity of that assumption by holding that BCRA &#xA7;203 is susceptible to as-applied challenges.  546 U. S., at 411&#x96;412.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Accepting the notion that a ban on campaign speech could also embrace issue advocacy would call into question our holding in <em>Bellotti</em> that the corporate identity of a speaker does not strip corporations of all free speech rights.  435 U. S., at 778.  It would be a constitutional &#x93;bait and switch&#x94; to conclude that corporate campaign speech may be banned in part <em>because </em>corporate issue advocacy is not, and then assert that corporate issue advocacy may be banned as well, pursuant to the same asserted compelling interest, through a broad conception of what constitutes the functional equivalent of campaign speech, or by relying on the inability to distinguish campaign speech from issue advocacy.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC and intervenors do not argue that the <em>Austin</em> interest justifies regulating genuine issue ads.  Instead, they focus on establishing that WRTL&#x92;s ads are the functional equivalent of express advocacy&#x97;a contention we have already rejected.  We hold that the interest recognized in <em>Austin</em> as justifying regulation of corporate campaign speech and extended in <em>McConnell</em> to the functional equivalent of such speech has no application to issue advocacy of the sort engaged in by WRTL.<a name="ZO-10ref" href="#ZO-10" class="">

We have no occasion to revisit that determination today.

&#x93; &#x91;LOAN OFFICER: Welcome Mr. and Mrs. Shulman.  We&#x92;ve reviewed your loan application, along with your credit report, the appraisal on the house, the inspections, and well &#x2026;

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-4" href="#ZO-4ref">4</a> This is particularly true given that the methodology, data, and conclusions of the two studies were the subject of serious dispute among the District Court judges.  Compare McConnell v. FEC, 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 307&#x96;312 (DC 2003) (opinion of Henderson, J.) (stating that the studies were flawed and of limited evidentiary value), with id., at 585, 583&#x96;588 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (finding the studies generally credible, but stating that &#x93;I am troubled by the fact that coders in both studies were asked questions regarding their own perceptions of the advertisements&#x92; purposes, and that [some of] these perceptions were later recoded&#x94; by study supervisors).  Nothing in this Court&#x92;s opinion in McConnell suggests it was resolving the sharp disagreements about the evidentiary record in this respect.
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-5" href="#ZO-5ref">5</a> Consider what happened in these cases.  The District Court permitted extensive discovery on the assumption that WRTL&#x92;s intent was relevant.  As a result, the defendants deposed WRTL&#x92;s executive director, its legislative director, its political action committee director, its lead communications consultant, and one of its fundraisers.  WRTL also had to turn over many documents related to its operations, plans, and finances.  Such litigation constitutes a severe burden on political speech.
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-6" href="#ZO-6ref">6</a> For these reasons, we cannot agree with Justice Souter&#x92;s assertion that &#x93;anyone who heard the Feingold ads &#x2026; would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.&#x94;  Post, at 23.  The dissent supports this assertion by likening WRTL&#x92;s ads to the &#x93;Jane Doe&#x94; example identified in McConnell v. Federal Election Comm&#x92;n, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/540/93" class="subref" title="subref">540 U. S. 93</a> (2003)
.  But that ad &#x93;condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue.&#x94;  Post, at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).  WRTL&#x92;s ads do not do so; they instead take a position on the filibuster issue and exhort constituents to contact Senators Feingold and Kohl to advance that position.  Indeed, one would not even know from the ads whether Senator Feingold supported or opposed filibusters.  Justice Souter is confident Wisconsinites independently knew Senator Feingold&#x92;s position on filibusters, but we think that confidence misplaced.  A prominent study found, for example, that during the 2000 election cycle, 85 percent of respondents to a survey were not even able to name at least one candidate for the House of Representatives in their own district.  See Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, American National Election Study, 2000: Pre- and Post-Election Survey 243 (N.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-7" href="#ZO-7ref">7</a> Justice Scalia thinks our test impermissibly vague.  See post, at 11&#x96;12 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  As should be evident, we agree with Justice Scalia on the imperative for clarity in this area; that is why our test affords protection unless an ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  It is why we emphasize that (1) there can be no free-ranging intent-and-effect test; (2) there generally should be no discovery or inquiry into the sort of &#x93;contextual&#x94; factors highlighted by the FEC and intervenors; (3) discussion of issues cannot be banned merely because the issues might be relevant to an election; and (4) in a debatable case, the tie is resolved in favor of protecting speech.  And keep in mind this test is only triggered if the speech meets the brightline requirements of BCRA &#xA7;203 in the first place.  Justice Scalia&#x92;s criticism of our test is all the more confusing because he accepts WRTL&#x92;s proposed three-prong test as &#x93;clear.&#x94;  Post, at 17.  We do not think our test any vaguer than WRTL&#x92;s, and it is more protective of political speech.


Justice Scalia also asserts that our test conflicts with Buckley v. Valeo, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
 (per curiam).  Post, at 13&#x96;16.  The Buckley Court confronted a statute restricting &#x93;any expenditure &#x2026; relative to a clearly identified candidate.&#x94;  424 U. S., at 42 (internal quotation marks omitted).  To avoid vagueness concerns, this Court first narrowed the statute to cover only expenditures expressly &#x93;advocating the election or defeat of a candidate&#x94;&#x97;using the so-called &#x93;magic words&#x94; of express advocacy.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court then proceeded to strike down the newly narrowed statute under strict scrutiny on the ground that its reach was not broad enough.  Id., at 44.  From this, Justice Scalia concludes that &#x93;[i]f a permissible test short of the magic-words test existed, Buckley would surely have adopted it.&#x94;  Post, at 14.  We are not so sure.  The question in Buckley was how a particular statutory provision could be construed to avoid vagueness concerns, not what the constitutional standard for clarity was in the abstract, divorced from specific statutory language.  Buckley&#x92;s intermediate step of statutory construction on the way to its constitutional holding does not dictate a constitutional test.  The Buckley Court&#x92;s &#x93;express advocacy restriction was an endpoint of statutory interpretation, not a first principle of constitutional law.&#x94;  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 190.  And despite Justice Scalia&#x92;s claim to the contrary, our citation of Buckley along with other decisions in rejecting an intent-and-effect test does not force us to adopt (or reject) Buckley&#x92;s statutory construction as a constitutional test.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-8" href="#ZO-8ref">8</a> Nothing in McConnell&#x92;s statement that the &#x93;vast majority&#x94; of issue ads broadcast in the periods preceding federal elections had an &#x93;electioneering purpose&#x94; forecloses this conclusion.  540 U. S., at 206.  Courts do not resolve unspecified as-applied challenges in the course of resolving a facial attack, so McConnell could not have settled the issue we address today.  See Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">22</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;The fact that [a law] is capable of valid applications does not necessarily mean that it is valid as applied to these litigants&#x94;).  Indeed, WRTL I confirmed as much.  546 U. S., at 411&#x96;412.  By the same token, in deciding this as-applied challenge, we have no occasion to revisit McConnell&#x92;s conclusion that the statute is not facially overbroad.


The &#x93;vast majority&#x94; language, moreover, is beside the point.  The McConnell Court did not find that a &#x93;vast majority&#x94; of the issue ads considered were the functional equivalent of direct advocacy.  Rather, it found that such ads had an &#x93;electioneering purpose.&#x94;  For the reasons we have explained, &#x93;purpose&#x94; is not the appropriate test for distinguishing between genuine issue ads and the functional equivalent of express campaign advocacy.  See supra, at 14&#x96;15.  In addition, the &#x93;vast majority&#x94; statement was not necessary to the Court&#x92;s facial holding in McConnell.  The standard required for a statute to survive an overbreadth challenge is not that the &#x93;vast majority&#x94; of a statute&#x92;s applications be legitimate.  &#x93;[B]road language . . . unnecessary to the Court&#x92;s decision &#x2026; cannot be considered binding authority.&#x94;  Kastigar v.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-9" href="#ZO-9ref">9</a> The dissent stresses a number of points that, while not central to our decision, nevertheless merit a response.  First, the dissent overstates its case when it asserts that the &#x93;PAC alternative&#x94; gives corporations a constitutionally sufficient outlet to speak.  See post, at 30.  PACs impose well-documented and onerous burdens, particularly on small nonprofits.  See MCFL, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/479/238" class="subref" title="subref">479 U. S. 238</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">253</a>&#x96;255 (1986)
 (plurality opinion).  McConnell did conclude that segregated funds &#x93;provid[e] corporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy&#x94; and its functional equivalent, 540 U. S., at 203, but that holding did not extend beyond functional equivalents&#x97;and if it did, the PAC option would justify regulation of all corporate speech, a proposition we have rejected, see Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 777&#x96;778.  Second, the response that a speaker should just take out a newspaper ad, or use a website, rather than complain that it cannot speak through a broadcast communication, see post, at 18&#x96;19, 33, is too glib.  Even assuming for the sake of argument that the possibility of using a different medium of communication has relevance in determining the permissibility of a limitation on speech, newspaper ads and websites are not reasonable alternatives to broadcast speech in terms of impact and effectiveness.  See McConnell v. FEC, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 569&#x96;573, 646 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.).  Third, we disagree with the dissent&#x92;s view that corporations can still speak by changing what they say to avoid mentioning candidates, post, at 30&#x96;31.  That argument is akin to telling Cohen that he cannot wear his jacket because he is free to wear one that says &#x93;I disagree with the draft,&#x94; cf. Cohen v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/15" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 15</a> (1971)
, or telling 44 Liquormart that it can advertise so long as it avoids mentioning prices, cf. 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/484" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 484</a> (1996)
.  Such notions run afoul of &#x93;the fundamental rule of protection under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.&#x94;  Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.,

They assert that &#x93;[s]peech by nonprofit advocacy groups on behalf of their members does not &#x91;corrupt&#x92; candidates or &#x91;distort&#x92; the political marketplace,&#x94; and that &#x93;[n]onprofit advocacy groups funded by individuals are readily distinguished from for-profit corporations funded by general treasuries.&#x94;  Brief for Family Research Council et al. as Amici Curiae 3, 4.  Cf. MCFL, 479 U. S., at 264.  We do not pass on this argument in this as-applied challenge because WRTL&#x92;s funds for its ads were not derived solely from individual contributions.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/540/93" class="subref" title="subref">540 U. S. 93</a> (2003)
, this Court considered whether &#xA7;203 was facially overbroad under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> because it captured within its reach not only campaign speech, or &#x93;express advocacy,&#x94; but also speech about public issues more generally, or &#x93;issue advocacy,&#x94; that mentions a candidate for federal office.  The Court concluded that there was no overbreadth concern to the extent the speech in question was the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express campaign speech.  <em>Id.</em>, at 204&#x96;205, 206.  On the other hand, the Court &#x93;assume[d]&#x94; that the interests it had found to &#x93;justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads.&#x94;  <em>Id., </em>at 206, n. 88.  The Court nonetheless determined that &#xA7;203 was not facially overbroad.  Even assuming &#xA7;203 &#x93;inhibit[ed] some constitutionally protected corporate and union speech,&#x94; the Court concluded that those challenging the law on its face had failed to carry their &#x93;heavy burden&#x94; of establishing that <em>all </em>enforcement of the law should therefore be prohibited.  <em>Id.,</em> at 207.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Last Term, we reversed a lower court ruling, arising in the same litigation before us now, that our decision in <em>McConnell</em> left &#x93;no room&#x94; for as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203.

        <p class="bodytext">    We now confront such an as-applied challenge.

 (<em>per curiam</em>).  Our development of the law in this area requires us, however, to draw such a line, because we have recognized that the interests held to justify the regulation of campaign speech and its &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; &#x93;might not apply&#x94; to the regulation of issue advocacy.  <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 206, and n. 88.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93; &#x91;BRIDE&#x92;S FATHER: Well, as father of the bride, I certainly could.  But instead, I&#x92;d like to share a few tips on how to properly install drywall.  Now you put the drywall up &#x2026;</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL planned on running &#x93;Wedding,&#x94; &#x93;Waiting,&#x94; and &#x93;Loan&#x94; throughout August 2004 and financing the ads with funds from its general treasury.  It recognized, however, that as of August 15, 30 days prior to the Wisconsin primary, the ads would be illegal &#x93;electioneering communication[s]&#x94; under BCRA &#xA7;203.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Believing that it nonetheless possessed a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to broadcast these ads, WRTL filed suit against the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on July 28, 2004, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief before a three-judge District Court.  See note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/437h.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;437h</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV); 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2284.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;2284</a>.  WRTL alleged that BCRA&#x92;s prohibition on the use of corporate treasury funds for &#x93;electioneering communication[s]&#x94; as defined in the Act is unconstitutional as applied to &#x93;Wedding,&#x94; &#x93;Loan,&#x94; and &#x93;Waiting,&#x94; as well as any materially similar ads it might seek to run in the future.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Just before the BCRA blackout period was to begin, the District Court denied a preliminary injunction, concluding that &#x93;the reasoning of the <em>McConnell</em> Court leaves no room for the kind of &#x91;as applied&#x92; challenge WRTL propounds before us.&#x94;  App. to Juris. Statement 52a.  In response to this ruling, WRTL did not run its ads during the blackout period.  The District Court subsequently dismissed WRTL&#x92;s complaint.  See <em>id.,</em> at 47a&#x96;48a (&#x93;WRTL&#x92;s &#x91;as-applied&#x92; challenge to BCRA [&#xA7;203] is foreclosed by the Supreme Court&#x92;s decision in <em>McConnell</em>&#x94;).  On appeal, we vacated the District Court&#x92;s judgment, holding that <em>McConnell</em> &#x93;did not purport to resolve future as-applied challenges&#x94; to BCRA &#xA7;203, and remanded &#x93;for the District Court to consider the merits of WRTL&#x92;s as-applied challenge in the first instance.&#x94;  <em>WRTL I</em>, 546 U. S., at 412.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On remand, after allowing four Members of Congress to intervene as defendants, the three-judge District Court granted summary judgment for WRTL, holding BCRA &#xA7;203 unconstitutional as applied to the three advertisements WRTL planned to run during the 2004 blackout period.  The District Court first found adjudication of the dispute not barred by mootness because the controversy was &#x93; &#x91;capable of repetition, yet evading review.&#x92; &#x94;  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 202.  Turning to the merits, the court began by noting that under <em>McConnell</em>, BCRA could constitutionally proscribe &#x93;express advocacy&#x94;&#x97;defined as ads that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office&#x97;and the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of such advocacy.  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 204.  Stating that it was limiting its inquiry to &#x93;language within the four corners&#x94; of the ads, <em>id.,</em> at 207, the District Court concluded that the ads were <em>not</em> express advocacy or its functional equivalent, but instead &#x93;genuine issue ads.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 205&#x96;208.  Then, reaching a question &#x93;left open in <em>McConnell</em>,&#x94; the court held that no compelling interest justified BCRA&#x92;s regulation of genuine issue ads such as those WRTL sought to run.  <em>Id., </em>at 208&#x96;210.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    One judge dissented, contending that the majority&#x92;s &#x93;plain facial analysis of the text in WRTL&#x92;s 2004 advertisements&#x94; ignored &#x93;the context in which the text was developed.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 210 (opinion of Roberts, J.).  In that judge&#x92;s view, a contextual analysis of the ads revealed &#x93;deep factual rifts between the parties concerning the purpose and intended effects of the ads&#x94; such that neither side was entitled to summary judgment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 210, 211.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC and intervenors filed separate notices of appeal and jurisdictional statements.  We consolidated the two appeals and set the matter for briefing and argument, postponing further consideration of jurisdiction to the hearing on the merits.  549 U. S. ___ (2007).</p>

.  Based on these principles, the FEC argues (though the intervenors do not) that these cases are moot because the 2004 election has passed and WRTL &#x93;does not assert any continuing interest in running [its three] advertisements, nor does it identify any reason to believe that a significant dispute over Senate filibusters of judicial nominees will occur in the foreseeable future.&#x94;  Brief for Appellant FEC 21.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    As the District Court found, it would be &#x93;entirely unreasonable . . . to expect that [WRTL] could have obtained complete judicial review of its claims in time for it to air its ads&#x94; during the BCRA blackout periods.  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 202.  The FEC contends that the 2-year window between elections provides ample time for parties to litigate their rights before each BCRA blackout period.  But groups like WRTL cannot predict what issues will be matters of public concern during a future blackout period.  In these cases, WRTL had no way of knowing well in advance that it would want to run ads on judicial filibusters during the BCRA blackout period.

 (<em>per curiam</em>)).  The FEC argues that in order to prove likely recurrence of the same controversy, WRTL must establish that it will run ads in the future sharing all &#x93;the characteristics that the district court deemed legally relevant.&#x94;  Brief for Appellant FEC 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC asks for too much.  We have recognized that the &#x93; &#x91;capable of repetition, yet evading review&#x92; doctrine, in the context of election cases, is appropriate when there are &#x91;as applied&#x92; challenges as well as in the more typical case involving only facial attacks.&#x94;  <em>Storer</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/415/724" class="subref" title="subref">415 U. S. 724</a>, n. 8 (1974).  Requiring repetition of every &#x93;legally relevant&#x94; characteristic of an as-applied challenge&#x97;down to the last detail&#x97;would effectively overrule this statement by making this exception unavailable for virtually all as-applied challenges.  History repeats itself, but not at the level of specificity demanded by the FEC.  Here, WRTL credibly claimed that it planned on running &#x93; &#x91;materially similar&#x92; &#x94; future targeted broadcast ads mentioning a candidate within the blackout period, 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 197, and there is no reason to believe that the FEC will &#x93;refrain from prosecuting violations&#x94; of BCRA, <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 775.  Under the circumstances, particularly where WRTL sought another preliminary injunction based on an ad it planned to run during the 2006 blackout period, see 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 203, n. 15, we hold that there exists a reasonable expectation that the same controversy involving the same party will recur.  We have jurisdiction to decide these cases.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL rightly concedes that its ads are prohibited by BCRA &#xA7;203.  Each ad clearly identifies Senator Feingold, who was running (unopposed) in the Wisconsin Democratic primary on September 14, 2004, and each ad would have been &#x93;targeted to the relevant electorate,&#x94; see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_C" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(C)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV), during the BCRA blackout period.  WRTL further concedes that its ads do not fit under any of BCRA&#x92;s exceptions to the term &#x93;electioneering communication.&#x94;  See &#xA7;434(f)(3)(B).  The only question, then, is whether it is consistent with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> for BCRA &#xA7;203 to prohibit WRTL from running these three ads.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Appellants contend that WRTL should be required to demonstrate that BCRA is unconstitutional as applied to the ads.  Reply Brief for Appellant Sen. John McCain et al. in No. 06&#x96;970, p. 5, n. 4; Brief for Appellant FEC 34.  After all, appellants reason, <em>McConnell</em> already held that BCRA &#xA7;203 was facially valid.  These cases, however, present the separate question whether &#xA7;203 may constitutionally be applied to these specific ads.  Because BCRA &#xA7;203 burdens political speech, it is subject to strict scrutiny.  See <em>McConnell</em>,<em/>540 U. S., at 205; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/652" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 652</a>,

; <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 252 (plurality opinion); <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 786; <em>Buckley</em>,<em/>424 U. S., at 44&#x96;45.  Under strict scrutiny, the <em>Government</em> must prove that applying BCRA to WRTL&#x92;s ads furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  See <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 786 (&#x93;Especially where, as here, a prohibition is directed at speech itself, and the speech is intimately related to the process of governing, &#x2026; &#x91;the burden is on the government to show the existence of [a compelling] interest&#x92; &#x94; (footnote omitted)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The strict scrutiny analysis is, of course, informed by our precedents.  This Court has already ruled that BCRA survives strict scrutiny to the extent it regulates express advocacy or its functional equivalent.  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 206.  So to the extent the ads in these cases fit this description, the FEC&#x92;s burden is not onerous; all it need do is point to <em>McConnell </em>and explain why it applies here.  If, on the other hand, WRTL&#x92;s ads are <em>not </em>express advocacy or its equivalent, the Government&#x92;s task is more formidable.  It must then demonstrate that banning such ads during the blackout periods is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.  No precedent of this Court has yet reached that conclusion.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC, intervenors, and the dissent below contend that <em>McConnell</em> already established the constitutional test for determining if an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy: whether the ad is intended to influence elections and has that effect.  See, <em>e.g., </em>466 F. Supp. 2d, at 214 (opinion of Roberts, J.).  Here is the relevant portion of our opinion in <em>McConnell</em>:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;[P]laintiffs argue that the justifications that adequately support the regulation of express advocacy do not apply to significant quantities of speech encompassed by the definition of electioneering communications.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;This argument fails to the extent that the issue ads broadcast during the 30- and 60-day periods preceding federal primary and general elections are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  The justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during those periods if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;<em/>540 U. S., at 205&#x96;206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL and the District Court majority, on the other hand, claim that <em>McConnell </em>did not adopt any test as the standard for future as-applied challenges.  We agree.  <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>analysis was grounded in the evidentiary record before the Court.  Two key studies in the <em>McConnell </em>record constituted &#x93;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions in support of their constitutional validity.&#x94;  <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>FEC</em>, 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 307, 308 (DC 2003) (opinion of Henderson, J.) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those studies asked &#x93;student coders&#x94; to separate ads based on whether the students thought the &#x93;purpose&#x94; of the ad was &#x93;to provide information about or urge action on a bill or issue,&#x94; or &#x93;to generate support or opposition for a particular candidate.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 308&#x96;309 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted); see Brief for Appellee 38.  The studies concluded &#x93; &#x91;that BCRA&#x92;s definition of Electioneering Communications accurately captures those ads that <em>have the purpose or effect of supporting candidates for election to office</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When the <em>McConnell</em> Court considered the possible facial overbreadth of &#xA7;203, it looked to the studies in the record analyzing ads broadcast during the blackout periods, and those studies had classified the ads in terms of intent and effect.  The Court&#x92;s assessment was accordingly phrased in the same terms, which the Court regarded as sufficient to conclude, on the record before it, that the plaintiffs had not &#x93;carried their heavy burden of proving&#x94; that &#xA7;203 was facially overbroad and could not be enforced in <em>any </em>circumstances.  540 U. S., at 207.  The Court did not explain that it was adopting a particular test for determining what constituted the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy.  The fact that the student coders who helped develop the evidentiary record before the Court in <em>McConnell</em> looked to intent and effect in doing so, and that the Court dealt with the record on that basis in deciding the facial overbreadth claim, neither compels nor warrants accepting that same standard as the constitutional test for separating, in an as-applied challenge, political speech protected under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> from that which may be banned.<a name="ZO-4ref" href="#ZO-4" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    More importantly, this Court in <em>Buckley</em> had already rejected an intent-and-effect test for distinguishing between discussions of issues and candidates.  See 424 U. S., at 43&#x96;44.  After noting the difficulty of distinguishing between discussion of issues on the one hand and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates on the other, the <em>Buckley </em>Court explained that analyzing the question in terms &#x93; &#x91;of intent and of effect&#x92; &#x94; would afford &#x93; &#x91;no security for free discussion.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id., </em>at 43 (quoting <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Collins</em>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">535</a> (1945)
).  It therefore rejected such an approach, and<em> McConnell </em>did not purport to overrule <em>Buckley</em> on this point&#x97;or even address what <em>Buckley </em>had to say on the subject.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">     For the reasons regarded as sufficient in <em>Buckley</em>, we decline to adopt a test for as-applied challenges turning on the speaker&#x92;s intent to affect an election.  The test to distinguish constitutionally protected political speech from speech that BCRA may proscribe should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights.  The test should also &#x93;reflec[t] our &#x91;profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 14 (quoting <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/376/254" class="subref" title="subref">376 U. S. 254</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">270</a> (1964)
).  A test turning on the intent of the speaker does not remotely fit the bill.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Far from serving the values the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> is meant to protect, an intent-based test would chill core political speech by opening the door to a trial on every ad within the terms of &#xA7;203, on the theory that the speaker actually intended to affect an election, no matter how compelling the indications that the ad concerned a pending legislative or policy issue.  No reasonable speaker would choose to run an ad covered by BCRA if its only defense to a criminal prosecution would be that its motives were pure.  An intent-based standard &#x93;blankets with uncertainty whatever may be said,&#x94; and &#x93;offers no security for free discussion.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The FEC does not disagree.  In its brief filed in the first appeal in this litigation, it argued that a &#x93;constitutional standard that turned on the subjective sincerity of a speaker&#x92;s message would likely be incapable of workable application; at a minimum, it would invite costly, fact-dependent litigation.&#x94;  Brief for Appellee in <em>WRTL I</em>, O.

        <p class="bodytext">    In light of these considerations, a court should find that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  Under this test, WRTL&#x92;s three ads are plainly not the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  First, their content is consistent with that of a genuine issue ad: The ads focus on a legislative issue, take a position on the issue, exhort the public to adopt that position, and urge the public to contact public officials with respect to the matter.  Second, their content lacks indicia of express advocacy: The ads do not mention an election, candidacy, political party, or challenger; and they do not take a position on a candidate&#x92;s character, qualifications, or fitness for office.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Despite these characteristics, appellants assert that the content of WRTL&#x92;s ads alone betrays their electioneering nature.  Indeed, the FEC suggests that <em>any </em>ad covered by &#xA7;203 that includes &#x93;an appeal to citizens to contact their elected representative&#x94; is the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of an ad saying defeat or elect that candidate.  Brief for Appellant FEC 31; see Brief for Appellant Sen. John McCain et al<em>. </em>in No. 06&#x96;970, pp. 21&#x96;23 (hereinafter McCain Brief).  We do not agree.  To take just one example, during a blackout period the House considered the proposed Universal National Service Act.  See App. to Brief for American Center for Law and Justice et al<em>.</em> as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> B&#x96;3.  There would be no reason to regard an ad supporting or opposing that Act, and urging citizens to contact their Representative about it, as the equivalent of an ad saying vote for or against the Representative.  Issue advocacy conveys information and educates.  An issue ad&#x92;s impact on an election, if it exists at all, will come only after the voters hear the information and choose&#x97;uninvited by the ad&#x97;to factor it into their voting decisions.<a name="ZO-6ref" href="#ZO-6" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC and intervenors try to turn this difference to their advantage, citing <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s statements &#x93;that the most effective campaign ads, like the most effective commercials for products . . . avoid the [<em>Buckley</em>]<em/>magic words [expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate],&#x94; 540 U. S., at 127, and that advertisers &#x93;would seldom choose to use such words even if permitted,&#x94; <em>id.,</em> at 193.  See McCain Brief<em/>19.  An expert for the FEC in these cases relied on those observations to argue that WRTL&#x92;s ads are especially effective electioneering ads because they are &#x93;subtl[e],&#x94; focusing on issues rather than simply exhorting the electorate to vote against Senator Feingold.  App. 56&#x96;57.  Rephrased a bit, the argument perversely maintains that the <em>less </em>an issue ad resembles express advocacy, the more likely it is to be the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  This &#x93;heads I win, tails you lose&#x94; approach cannot be correct.  It would effectively eliminate 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> protection for genuine issue ads, contrary to our conclusion in <em>WRTL I </em>that as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203 are available, and our assumption in <em>McConnell</em> that &#x93;the interests that justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads,&#x94; 540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  Under appellants&#x92; view, there can be no such thing as a genuine issue ad during the blackout period&#x97;it is simply a very effective electioneering ad.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Looking beyond the content of WRTL&#x92;s ads, the FEC and intervenors argue that several &#x93;contextual&#x94; factors prove that the ads are the equivalent of express advocacy.  First, appellants cite evidence that during the same election cycle, WRTL and its Political Action Committee (PAC) actively opposed Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection and identified filibusters as a campaign issue.  This evidence goes to WRTL&#x92;s subjective intent in running the ads, and we have already explained that WRTL&#x92;s intent is irrelevant in an as-applied challenge.  Evidence of this sort is therefore beside the point, as it should be&#x97;WRTL does not forfeit its right to speak on issues simply because in other aspects of its work it also opposes candidates who are involved with those issues.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Next, the FEC and intervenors seize on the timing of WRTL&#x92;s ads.  They observe that the ads were to be aired near elections but not near actual Senate votes on judicial nominees, and that WRTL did not run the ads after the elections.  To the extent this evidence goes to WRTL&#x92;s subjective intent, it is again irrelevant.  To the extent it nonetheless suggests that the ads should be interpreted as express advocacy, it falls short.  That the ads were run close to an election is unremarkable in a challenge like this.  <em>Every </em>ad covered by BCRA &#xA7;203 will by definition air just before a primary or general election.  If this were enough to prove that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy, then BCRA would be constitutional in all of its applications.  This Court unanimously rejected this contention in <em>WRTL I</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    That the ads were run shortly after the Senate had recessed is likewise unpersuasive.  Members of Congress often return to their districts during recess, precisely to determine the views of their constituents; an ad run at that time may succeed in getting more constituents to contact the Representative while he or she is back home.  In any event, a group can certainly choose to run an issue ad to coincide with public interest rather than a floor vote.  Finally, WRTL did not resume running its ads after the BCRA blackout period because, as it explains, the debate had changed.  Brief for Appellee 16.  The focus of the Senate was on whether a majority would vote to change the Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster&#x97;not whether individual Senators would continue filibustering.  Given this change, WRTL&#x92;s decision not to continue running<span class="softbreak"/>its ads after the blackout period does not support an inference that the ads were the functional equivalent of electioneering.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The last piece of contextual evidence the FEC and intervenors highlight is the ads&#x92; &#x93;specific and repeated cross-reference&#x94; to a website.  Reply Brief for Appellant FEC 15.  In the middle of the website&#x92;s homepage, in large type, were the addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses of Senators Feingold and Kohl.  Wisconsinites who viewed &#x93;Wedding,&#x94; &#x93;Loan,&#x94; or &#x93;Waiting&#x94; and wished to contact their Senators&#x97;as the ads requested&#x97;would be able to obtain the pertinent contact information immediately upon visiting the website.  This is fully consistent with viewing WRTL&#x92;s ads as genuine issue ads.  The website also stated both Wisconsin Senators&#x92; positions on judicial filibusters, and allowed visitors to sign up for &#x93;e-alerts,&#x94; some of which contained exhortations to vote against Senator Feingold.  These details lend the electioneering interpretation of the ads more credence, but again, WRTL&#x92;s participation in express advocacy in other aspects of its work is not a justification for censoring its issue-related speech.  Any express advocacy on the website, already one step removed from the text of the ads themselves, certainly does not render an interpretation of the ads as genuine issue ads unreasonable.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given the standard we have adopted for determining whether an ad is the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy, contextual factors of the sort invoked by appellants should seldom play a significant role in the inquiry.  Courts need not ignore basic background information that may be necessary to put an ad in context&#x97;such as whether an ad &#x93;describes a legislative issue that is either currently the subject of legislative scrutiny or likely to be the subject of such scrutiny in the near future,&#x94; 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 207&#x97;but the need to consider such background should not become an excuse for discovery or a broader inquiry of the sort we have just noted raises 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> concerns.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At best, appellants have shown what we have acknowledged at least since <em>Buckley</em>: that &#x93;the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application.&#x94;  424 U. S., at 42.  Under the test set forth above, that is not enough to establish that the ads can only reasonably be viewed as advocating or opposing a candidate in a federal election.  &#x93;Freedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period.&#x94;  <em>Thornhill</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>,

The District Court below considered interests that might justify regulating WRTL&#x92;s ads here, and found none sufficiently compelling.  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 208&#x96;210.

        <p class="bodytext">    At the outset, we reject the contention that issue advocacy may be regulated because express election advocacy may be, and &#x93;the speech involved in so-called issue advocacy is [not] any more core political speech than are words of express advocacy.&#x94;  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 205.  This greater-includes-the-lesser approach is not how strict scrutiny works.  A corporate ad expressing support for the local football team could not be regulated on the ground that such speech is less &#x93;core&#x94; than corporate speech about an election, which we have held may be restricted.  A court applying strict scrutiny must ensure that a compelling interest supports <em>each application</em> of a statute restricting speech.  That a compelling interest justifies restrictions on express advocacy tells us little about whether a compelling interest justifies restrictions on issue advocacy; the <em>McConnell </em>Court itself made just that point.  See 540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  Such a greater-includes-the-lesser argument would dictate that virtually <em>all </em>corporate speech can be suppressed, since few kinds of speech can lay claim to being as central to the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> as campaign speech.  That conclusion is clearly foreclosed by our precedent.  See, <em>e.g.,</em>
            <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 776&#x96;777.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This Court has long recognized &#x93;the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption&#x94; in election campaigns.  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 45.  This interest has been invoked as a reason for upholding <em>contribution</em> limits.  As <em>Buckley </em>explained, &#x93;[t]o the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political <em>quid pro quo</em> from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 26&#x96;27.  We have suggested that this interest might also justify limits on electioneering <em>expenditures</em> because it may be that, in some circumstances, &#x93;large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements as do large contributions.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 45.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em> arguably applied this interest&#x97;which this Court had only assumed could justify regulation of express advocacy&#x97;to ads that were the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy.  See 540 U. S., at 204&#x96;206.  But to justify regulation of WRTL&#x92;s ads, this interest must be stretched yet another step to ads that are <em>not</em> the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Enough is enough.  Issue ads like WRTL&#x92;s are by no means equivalent to contributions, and the <em>quid-pro-quo </em>corruption interest cannot justify regulating them.  To equate WRTL&#x92;s ads with contributions is to ignore their value as political speech.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Appellants argue that an expansive definition of &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; is needed to ensure that issue advocacy does not circumvent the rule against express advocacy, which in turn helps protect against circumvention of the rule against contributions.  Cf. <em>McConnell, supra,</em> at 205 (&#x93;[R]ecent cases have recognized that certain restrictions on corporate electoral involvement permissibly hedge against circumvention of [valid] contribution limits&#x94; (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original)).  But such a prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis approach to regulating expression is not consistent with strict scrutiny.  &#x93;[T]he desire for a bright-line rule . . . hardly constitutes the <em>compelling </em>state interest necessary to justify any infringement on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> freedom.&#x94;  <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 263.  See <em>Free Speech Coalition</em>, 535 U. S., at 255 (&#x93;The Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech&#x94;); <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 44 (expenditure limitations &#x93;cannot be sustained simply by invoking the interest in maximizing the effectiveness of the less intrusive contribution limitations&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A second possible compelling interest recognized by this Court lies in addressing a &#x93;different type of corruption in the political arena: the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x94;  <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660.  <em>Austin </em>invoked this interest to uphold a state statute making it a felony for corporations to use treasury funds for independent expenditures on express election advocacy.  <em>Id.,</em> at 654&#x96;655.  <em>McConnell</em> also relied on this interest in upholding regulation not just of express advocacy, but also its &#x93;functional equivalent.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 205&#x96;206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These cases did not suggest, however, that the interest in combating &#x93;a different type of corruption&#x94; extended beyond campaign speech.  Quite the contrary.  Two of the Justices who joined the 6-to-3 majority in <em>Austin</em> relied, in upholding the constitutionality of the ban on campaign speech, on the fact that corporations retained freedom to speak on issues as distinct from election campaigns.  See 494 U. S., at 675&#x96;678 (Brennan, J., concurring) (describing fact that campaign speech ban &#x93;does not regulate corporate expenditures in referenda or other corporate expression&#x94; as &#x93;reflect[ing] the requirements of our decisions&#x94;); <em>id.,</em> at 678 (<span class="smallcaps">Stevens</span>, J., concurring) (&#x93;[T]here is a vast difference between lobbying and debating public issues on the one hand, and political campaigns for election to public office on the other&#x94;).  The <em>McConnell </em>Court similarly was willing to &#x93;assume that the interests that justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  And our decision in <em>WRTL I </em>reinforced the validity of that assumption by holding that BCRA &#xA7;203 is susceptible to as-applied challenges.  546 U. S., at 411&#x96;412.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Accepting the notion that a ban on campaign speech could also embrace issue advocacy would call into question our holding in <em>Bellotti</em> that the corporate identity of a speaker does not strip corporations of all free speech rights.  435 U. S., at 778.  It would be a constitutional &#x93;bait and switch&#x94; to conclude that corporate campaign speech may be banned in part <em>because </em>corporate issue advocacy is not, and then assert that corporate issue advocacy may be banned as well, pursuant to the same asserted compelling interest, through a broad conception of what constitutes the functional equivalent of campaign speech, or by relying on the inability to distinguish campaign speech from issue advocacy.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC and intervenors do not argue that the <em>Austin</em> interest justifies regulating genuine issue ads.  Instead, they focus on establishing that WRTL&#x92;s ads are the functional equivalent of express advocacy&#x97;a contention we have already rejected.  We hold that the interest recognized in <em>Austin</em> as justifying regulation of corporate campaign speech and extended in <em>McConnell</em> to the functional equivalent of such speech has no application to issue advocacy of the sort engaged in by WRTL.<a name="ZO-10ref" href="#ZO-10" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    These cases are about political speech.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> opinions, we have gotten this far in the analysis without quoting the Amendment itself: &#x93;Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.&#x94;  The Framers&#x92; actual words put these cases in proper perspective.  Our jurisprudence over the past 216 years has rejected an absolutist interpretation of those words, but when it comes to drawing difficult lines in the area of pure political speech&#x97;between what is protected and what the Government may ban&#x97;it is worth recalling the language we are applying.  <em>McConnell</em> held that express advocacy of a candidate or his opponent by a corporation shortly before an election may be prohibited, along with the functional equivalent of such express advocacy.  We have no occasion to revisit that determination today.  But when it comes to defining what speech qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy subject to such a ban&#x97;the issue we <em>do</em> have to decide&#x97;we give the benefit of the doubt to speech, not censorship.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-2" href="#ZO-2ref">2</a> The radio script for &#x93;Loan&#x94; differs from &#x93;Wedding&#x94; only in its lead-in.  &#x93;Loan&#x94; begins:


&#x93; &#x91;LOAN OFFICER: Welcome Mr. and Mrs. Shulman.  We&#x92;ve reviewed your loan application, along with your credit report, the appraisal on the house, the inspections, and well &#x2026;


&#x93; &#x91;COUPLE: Yes, yes &#x2026; we&#x92;re listening.


&#x93; &#x91;OFFICER: Well, it all reminds me of a time I went fishing with my father.  We were on the Wolf River Waupaca &#x2026;


&#x93; &#x91;VOICE-OVER: Sometimes it&#x92;s just not fair to delay an important decision.


&#x93; &#x91;But in Washington it&#x92;s happening&#x2026; .&#x92; &#x94;  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 198, n. 4.


The remainder of the script is identical to &#x93;Wedding.&#x94;

The man reads the morning paper, polishes his shoes, scans through his Rolodex, and does other similar activities.  The television script for this ad reads:


&#x93; &#x91;VOICE-OVER: There are a lot of judicial nominees out there who can&#x92;t go to work.  Their careers are put on hold because a group of Senators is filibustering&#x97;blocking qualified nominees from a simple &#x93;yes&#x94; or &#x93;no&#x94; vote.


&#x93; &#x91;It&#x92;s politics at work and it&#x92;s causing gridlock&#x2026; .&#x92; &#x94;  Ibid.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-4" href="#ZO-4ref">4</a> This is particularly true given that the methodology, data, and conclusions of the two studies were the subject of serious dispute among the District Court judges.  Compare McConnell v. FEC, 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 307&#x96;312 (DC 2003) (opinion of Henderson, J.) (stating that the studies were flawed and of limited evidentiary value), with id., at 585, 583&#x96;588 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (finding the studies generally credible, but stating that &#x93;I am troubled by the fact that coders in both studies were asked questions regarding their own perceptions of the advertisements&#x92; purposes, and that [some of] these perceptions were later recoded&#x94; by study supervisors).  Nothing in this Court&#x92;s opinion in McConnell suggests it was resolving the sharp disagreements about the evidentiary record in this respect.
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-5" href="#ZO-5ref">5</a> Consider what happened in these cases.  The District Court permitted extensive discovery on the assumption that WRTL&#x92;s intent was relevant.  As a result, the defendants deposed WRTL&#x92;s executive director, its legislative director, its political action committee director, its lead communications consultant, and one of its fundraisers.  WRTL also had to turn over many documents related to its operations, plans, and finances.  Such litigation constitutes a severe burden on political speech.
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-6" href="#ZO-6ref">6</a> For these reasons, we cannot agree with Justice Souter&#x92;s assertion that &#x93;anyone who heard the Feingold ads &#x2026; would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.&#x94;  Post, at 23.  The dissent supports this assertion by likening WRTL&#x92;s ads to the &#x93;Jane Doe&#x94; example identified in McConnell v. Federal Election Comm&#x92;n, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/540/93" class="subref" title="subref">540 U. S. 93</a> (2003)
.  But that ad &#x93;condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue.&#x94;  Post, at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).  WRTL&#x92;s ads do not do so; they instead take a position on the filibuster issue and exhort constituents to contact Senators Feingold and Kohl to advance that position.  Indeed, one would not even know from the ads whether Senator Feingold supported or opposed filibusters.  Justice Souter is confident Wisconsinites independently knew Senator Feingold&#x92;s position on filibusters, but we think that confidence misplaced.  A prominent study found, for example, that during the 2000 election cycle, 85 percent of respondents to a survey were not even able to name at least one candidate for the House of Representatives in their own district.  See Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, American National Election Study, 2000: Pre- and Post-Election Survey 243 (N. Burns et al. eds. 2002) online at http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/cocoon/ICPSR/STUDY/03131.xml (as visited June 22, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-7" href="#ZO-7ref">7</a> Justice Scalia thinks our test impermissibly vague.  See post, at 11&#x96;12 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  As should be evident, we agree with Justice Scalia on the imperative for clarity in this area; that is why our test affords protection unless an ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  It is why we emphasize that (1) there can be no free-ranging intent-and-effect test; (2) there generally should be no discovery or inquiry into the sort of &#x93;contextual&#x94; factors highlighted by the FEC and intervenors; (3) discussion of issues cannot be banned merely because the issues might be relevant to an election; and (4) in a debatable case, the tie is resolved in favor of protecting speech.  And keep in mind this test is only triggered if the speech meets the brightline requirements of BCRA &#xA7;203 in the first place.  Justice Scalia&#x92;s criticism of our test is all the more confusing because he accepts WRTL&#x92;s proposed three-prong test as &#x93;clear.&#x94;  Post, at 17.  We do not think our test any vaguer than WRTL&#x92;s, and it is more protective of political speech.


Justice Scalia also asserts that our test conflicts with Buckley v. Valeo, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
 (per curiam).  Post, at 13&#x96;16.  The Buckley Court confronted a statute restricting &#x93;any expenditure &#x2026; relative to a clearly identified candidate.&#x94;  424 U. S., at 42 (internal quotation marks omitted).  To avoid vagueness concerns, this Court first narrowed the statute to cover only expenditures expressly &#x93;advocating the election or defeat of a candidate&#x94;&#x97;using the so-called &#x93;magic words&#x94; of express advocacy.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court then proceeded to strike down the newly narrowed statute under strict scrutiny on the ground that its reach was not broad enough.  Id., at 44.  From this, Justice Scalia concludes that &#x93;[i]f a permissible test short of the magic-words test existed, Buckley would surely have adopted it.&#x94;  Post, at 14.  We are not so sure.  The question in Buckley was how a particular statutory provision could be construed to avoid vagueness concerns, not what the constitutional standard for clarity was in the abstract, divorced from specific statutory language.  Buckley&#x92;s intermediate step of statutory construction on the way to its constitutional holding does not dictate a constitutional test.  The Buckley Court&#x92;s &#x93;express advocacy restriction was an endpoint of statutory interpretation, not a first principle of constitutional law.&#x94;  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 190.  And despite Justice Scalia&#x92;s claim to the contrary, our citation of Buckley along with other decisions in rejecting an intent-and-effect test does not force us to adopt (or reject) Buckley&#x92;s statutory construction as a constitutional test.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-8" href="#ZO-8ref">8</a> Nothing in McConnell&#x92;s statement that the &#x93;vast majority&#x94; of issue ads broadcast in the periods preceding federal elections had an &#x93;electioneering purpose&#x94; forecloses this conclusion.  540 U. S., at 206.  Courts do not resolve unspecified as-applied challenges in the course of resolving a facial attack, so McConnell could not have settled the issue we address today.  See Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/789" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 789</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">803</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">22</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;The fact that [a law] is capable of valid applications does not necessarily mean that it is valid as applied to these litigants&#x94;).  Indeed, WRTL I confirmed as much.  546 U. S., at 411&#x96;412.  By the same token, in deciding this as-applied challenge, we have no occasion to revisit McConnell&#x92;s conclusion that the statute is not facially overbroad.


The &#x93;vast majority&#x94; language, moreover, is beside the point.  The McConnell Court did not find that a &#x93;vast majority&#x94; of the issue ads considered were the functional equivalent of direct advocacy.  Rather, it found that such ads had an &#x93;electioneering purpose.&#x94;  For the reasons we have explained, &#x93;purpose&#x94; is not the appropriate test for distinguishing between genuine issue ads and the functional equivalent of express campaign advocacy.  See supra, at 14&#x96;15.  In addition, the &#x93;vast majority&#x94; statement was not necessary to the Court&#x92;s facial holding in McConnell.  The standard required for a statute to survive an overbreadth challenge is not that the &#x93;vast majority&#x94; of a statute&#x92;s applications be legitimate.  &#x93;[B]road language . . . unnecessary to the Court&#x92;s decision &#x2026; cannot be considered binding authority.&#x94;  Kastigar v.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-9" href="#ZO-9ref">9</a> The dissent stresses a number of points that, while not central to our decision, nevertheless merit a response.  First, the dissent overstates its case when it asserts that the &#x93;PAC alternative&#x94; gives corporations a constitutionally sufficient outlet to speak.  See post, at 30.  PACs impose well-documented and onerous burdens, particularly on small nonprofits.  See MCFL, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/479/238" class="subref" title="subref">479 U. S. 238</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">253</a>&#x96;255 (1986)
 (plurality opinion).  McConnell did conclude that segregated funds &#x93;provid[e] corporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy&#x94; and its functional equivalent, 540 U. S., at 203, but that holding did not extend beyond functional equivalents&#x97;and if it did, the PAC option would justify regulation of all corporate speech, a proposition we have rejected, see Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 777&#x96;778.  Second, the response that a speaker should just take out a newspaper ad, or use a website, rather than complain that it cannot speak through a broadcast communication, see post, at 18&#x96;19, 33, is too glib.  Even assuming for the sake of argument that the possibility of using a different medium of communication has relevance in determining the permissibility of a limitation on speech, newspaper ads and websites are not reasonable alternatives to broadcast speech in terms of impact and effectiveness.  See McConnell v. FEC, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 569&#x96;573, 646 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.).  Third, we disagree with the dissent&#x92;s view that corporations can still speak by changing what they say to avoid mentioning candidates, post, at 30&#x96;31.  That argument is akin to telling Cohen that he cannot wear his jacket because he is free to wear one that says &#x93;I disagree with the draft,&#x94; cf. Cohen v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/15" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 15</a> (1971)
, or telling 44 Liquormart that it can advertise so long as it avoids mentioning prices, cf. 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/484" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 484</a> (1996)
.  Such notions run afoul of &#x93;the fundamental rule of protection under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.&#x94;  Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.,

They assert that &#x93;[s]peech by nonprofit advocacy groups on behalf of their members does not &#x91;corrupt&#x92; candidates or &#x91;distort&#x92; the political marketplace,&#x94; and that &#x93;[n]onprofit advocacy groups funded by individuals are readily distinguished from for-profit corporations funded by general treasuries.&#x94;  Brief for Family Research Council et al. as Amici Curiae 3, 4.  Cf. MCFL, 479 U. S., at 264.  We do not pass on this argument in this as-applied challenge because WRTL&#x92;s funds for its ads were not derived solely from individual contributions.

In <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/540/93" class="subref" title="subref">540 U. S. 93</a> (2003)
, this Court considered whether &#xA7;203 was facially overbroad under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> because it captured within its reach not only campaign speech, or &#x93;express advocacy,&#x94; but also speech about public issues more generally, or &#x93;issue advocacy,&#x94; that mentions a candidate for federal office.  The Court concluded that there was no overbreadth concern to the extent the speech in question was the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express campaign speech.  <em>Id.</em>, at 204&#x96;205, 206.  On the other hand, the Court &#x93;assume[d]&#x94; that the interests it had found to &#x93;justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads.&#x94;  <em>Id., </em>at 206, n. 88.  The Court nonetheless determined that &#xA7;203 was not facially overbroad.  Even assuming &#xA7;203 &#x93;inhibit[ed] some constitutionally protected corporate and union speech,&#x94; the Court concluded that those challenging the law on its face had failed to carry their &#x93;heavy burden&#x94; of establishing that <em>all </em>enforcement of the law should therefore be prohibited.  <em>Id.,</em> at 207.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Last Term, we reversed a lower court ruling, arising in the same litigation before us now, that our decision in <em>McConnell</em> left &#x93;no room&#x94; for as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203.

        <p class="bodytext">    We now confront such an as-applied challenge.  Resolving it requires us first to determine whether the speech at issue is the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office, or instead a &#x93;genuine issue a[d].&#x94;  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 206, and n. 88. <em/>We have long recognized that the distinction between campaign advocacy and issue advocacy &#x93;may often dissolve in practical application.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">42</a> (1976)
 (<em>per curiam</em>).  Our development of the law in this area requires us, however, to draw such a line, because we have recognized that the interests held to justify the regulation of campaign speech and its &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; &#x93;might not apply&#x94; to the regulation of issue advocacy.  <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 206, and n. 88.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In drawing that line, the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> requires us to err on the side of protecting political speech rather than suppressing it.  We conclude that the speech at issue in this as-applied challenge is not the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express campaign speech.  We further conclude that the interests held to justify restricting corporate campaign speech or its functional equivalent do not justify restricting issue advocacy, and accordingly we hold that BCRA &#xA7;203 is unconstitutional as applied to the advertisements at issue in these cases.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL planned on running &#x93;Wedding,&#x94; &#x93;Waiting,&#x94; and &#x93;Loan&#x94; throughout August 2004 and financing the ads with funds from its general treasury.  It recognized, however, that as of August 15, 30 days prior to the Wisconsin primary, the ads would be illegal &#x93;electioneering communication[s]&#x94; under BCRA &#xA7;203.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Believing that it nonetheless possessed a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to broadcast these ads, WRTL filed suit against the Federal Election Commission (FEC) on July 28, 2004, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief before a three-judge District Court.  See note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/437h.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;437h</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV); 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2284.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;2284</a>.  WRTL alleged that BCRA&#x92;s prohibition on the use of corporate treasury funds for &#x93;electioneering communication[s]&#x94; as defined in the Act is unconstitutional as applied to &#x93;Wedding,&#x94; &#x93;Loan,&#x94; and &#x93;Waiting,&#x94; as well as any materially similar ads it might seek to run in the future.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Just before the BCRA blackout period was to begin, the District Court denied a preliminary injunction, concluding that &#x93;the reasoning of the <em>McConnell</em> Court leaves no room for the kind of &#x91;as applied&#x92; challenge WRTL propounds before us.&#x94;  App. to Juris. Statement 52a.  In response to this ruling, WRTL did not run its ads during the blackout period.  The District Court subsequently dismissed WRTL&#x92;s complaint.  See <em>id.,</em> at 47a&#x96;48a (&#x93;WRTL&#x92;s &#x91;as-applied&#x92; challenge to BCRA [&#xA7;203] is foreclosed by the Supreme Court&#x92;s decision in <em>McConnell</em>&#x94;).  On appeal, we vacated the District Court&#x92;s judgment, holding that <em>McConnell</em> &#x93;did not purport to resolve future as-applied challenges&#x94; to BCRA &#xA7;203, and remanded &#x93;for the District Court to consider the merits of WRTL&#x92;s as-applied challenge in the first instance.&#x94;  <em>WRTL I</em>, 546 U. S., at 412.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On remand, after allowing four Members of Congress to intervene as defendants, the three-judge District Court granted summary judgment for WRTL, holding BCRA &#xA7;203 unconstitutional as applied to the three advertisements WRTL planned to run during the 2004 blackout period.  The District Court first found adjudication of the dispute not barred by mootness because the controversy was &#x93; &#x91;capable of repetition, yet evading review.&#x92; &#x94;  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 202.  Turning to the merits, the court began by noting that under <em>McConnell</em>, BCRA could constitutionally proscribe &#x93;express advocacy&#x94;&#x97;defined as ads that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office&#x97;and the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of such advocacy.  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 204.  Stating that it was limiting its inquiry to &#x93;language within the four corners&#x94; of the ads, <em>id.,</em> at 207, the District Court concluded that the ads were <em>not</em> express advocacy or its functional equivalent, but instead &#x93;genuine issue ads.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 205&#x96;208.  Then, reaching a question &#x93;left open in <em>McConnell</em>,&#x94; the court held that no compelling interest justified BCRA&#x92;s regulation of genuine issue ads such as those WRTL sought to run.  <em>Id., </em>at 208&#x96;210.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    One judge dissented, contending that the majority&#x92;s &#x93;plain facial analysis of the text in WRTL&#x92;s 2004 advertisements&#x94; ignored &#x93;the context in which the text was developed.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 210 (opinion of Roberts, J.).  In that judge&#x92;s view, a contextual analysis of the ads revealed &#x93;deep factual rifts between the parties concerning the purpose and intended effects of the ads&#x94; such that neither side was entitled to summary judgment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 210, 211.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC and intervenors filed separate notices of appeal and jurisdictional statements.

.  Based on these principles, the FEC argues (though the intervenors do not) that these cases are moot because the 2004 election has passed and WRTL &#x93;does not assert any continuing interest in running [its three] advertisements, nor does it identify any reason to believe that a significant dispute over Senate filibusters of judicial nominees will occur in the foreseeable future.&#x94;  Brief for Appellant FEC 21.</p>

But groups like WRTL cannot predict what issues will be matters of public concern during a future blackout period.  In these cases, WRTL had no way of knowing well in advance that it would want to run ads on judicial filibusters during the BCRA blackout period.

        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC asks for too much.  We have recognized that the &#x93; &#x91;capable of repetition, yet evading review&#x92; doctrine, in the context of election cases, is appropriate when there are &#x91;as applied&#x92; challenges as well as in the more typical case involving only facial attacks.&#x94;  <em>Storer</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/415/724" class="subref" title="subref">415 U. S. 724</a>, n. 8 (1974).  Requiring repetition of every &#x93;legally relevant&#x94; characteristic of an as-applied challenge&#x97;down to the last detail&#x97;would effectively overrule this statement by making this exception unavailable for virtually all as-applied challenges.  History repeats itself, but not at the level of specificity demanded by the FEC.  Here, WRTL credibly claimed that it planned on running &#x93; &#x91;materially similar&#x92; &#x94; future targeted broadcast ads mentioning a candidate within the blackout period, 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 197, and there is no reason to believe that the FEC will &#x93;refrain from prosecuting violations&#x94; of BCRA, <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 775.  Under the circumstances, particularly where WRTL sought another preliminary injunction based on an ad it planned to run during the 2006 blackout period, see 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 203, n. 15, we hold that there exists a reasonable expectation that the same controversy involving the same party will recur.  We have jurisdiction to decide these cases.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL rightly concedes that its ads are prohibited by BCRA &#xA7;203.  Each ad clearly identifies Senator Feingold, who was running (unopposed) in the Wisconsin Democratic primary on September 14, 2004, and each ad would have been &#x93;targeted to the relevant electorate,&#x94; see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_C" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(C)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV), during the BCRA blackout period.  WRTL further concedes that its ads do not fit under any of BCRA&#x92;s exceptions to the term &#x93;electioneering communication.&#x94;  See &#xA7;434(f)(3)(B).  The only question, then, is whether it is consistent with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> for BCRA &#xA7;203 to prohibit WRTL from running these three ads.</p>

These cases, however, present the separate question whether &#xA7;203 may constitutionally be applied to these specific ads.  Because BCRA &#xA7;203 burdens political speech, it is subject to strict scrutiny.  See <em>McConnell</em>,<em/>540 U. S., at 205; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/652" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 652</a>,

; <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 252 (plurality opinion); <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 786; <em>Buckley</em>,<em/>424 U. S., at 44&#x96;45.  Under strict scrutiny, the <em>Government</em> must prove that applying BCRA to WRTL&#x92;s ads furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  See <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 786 (&#x93;Especially where, as here, a prohibition is directed at speech itself, and the speech is intimately related to the process of governing, &#x2026; &#x91;the burden is on the government to show the existence of [a compelling] interest&#x92; &#x94; (footnote omitted)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The strict scrutiny analysis is, of course, informed by our precedents.  This Court has already ruled that BCRA survives strict scrutiny to the extent it regulates express advocacy or its functional equivalent.  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 206.  So to the extent the ads in these cases fit this description, the FEC&#x92;s burden is not onerous; all it need do is point to <em>McConnell </em>and explain why it applies here.  If, on the other hand, WRTL&#x92;s ads are <em>not </em>express advocacy or its equivalent, the Government&#x92;s task is more formidable.  It must then demonstrate that banning such ads during the blackout periods is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.  No precedent of this Court has yet reached that conclusion.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC, intervenors, and the dissent below contend that <em>McConnell</em> already established the constitutional test for determining if an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy: whether the ad is intended to influence elections and has that effect.  See, <em>e.g., </em>466 F. Supp. 2d, at 214 (opinion of Roberts, J.).  Here is the relevant portion of our opinion in <em>McConnell</em>:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;[P]laintiffs argue that the justifications that adequately support the regulation of express advocacy do not apply to significant quantities of speech encompassed by the definition of electioneering communications.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;This argument fails to the extent that the issue ads broadcast during the 30- and 60-day periods preceding federal primary and general elections are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  The justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during those periods if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;<em/>540 U. S., at 205&#x96;206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL and the District Court majority, on the other hand, claim that <em>McConnell </em>did not adopt any test as the standard for future as-applied challenges.  We agree.  <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>analysis was grounded in the evidentiary record before the Court.  Two key studies in the <em>McConnell </em>record constituted &#x93;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions in support of their constitutional validity.&#x94;  <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>FEC</em>, 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 307, 308 (DC 2003) (opinion of Henderson, J.) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those studies asked &#x93;student coders&#x94; to separate ads based on whether the students thought the &#x93;purpose&#x94; of the ad was &#x93;to provide information about or urge action on a bill or issue,&#x94; or &#x93;to generate support or opposition for a particular candidate.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 308&#x96;309 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted); see Brief for Appellee 38.  The studies concluded &#x93; &#x91;that BCRA&#x92;s definition of Electioneering Communications accurately captures those ads that <em>have the purpose or effect of supporting candidates for election to office</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When the <em>McConnell</em> Court considered the possible facial overbreadth of &#xA7;203, it looked to the studies in the record analyzing ads broadcast during the blackout periods, and those studies had classified the ads in terms of intent and effect.  The Court&#x92;s assessment was accordingly phrased in the same terms, which the Court regarded as sufficient to conclude, on the record before it, that the plaintiffs had not &#x93;carried their heavy burden of proving&#x94; that &#xA7;203 was facially overbroad and could not be enforced in <em>any </em>circumstances.  540 U. S., at 207.  The Court did not explain that it was adopting a particular test for determining what constituted the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy.  The fact that the student coders who helped develop the evidentiary record before the Court in <em>McConnell</em> looked to intent and effect in doing so, and that the Court dealt with the record on that basis in deciding the facial overbreadth claim, neither compels nor warrants accepting that same standard as the constitutional test for separating, in an as-applied challenge, political speech protected under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> from that which may be banned.<a name="ZO-4ref" href="#ZO-4" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    More importantly, this Court in <em>Buckley</em> had already rejected an intent-and-effect test for distinguishing between discussions of issues and candidates.  See 424 U. S., at 43&#x96;44.  After noting the difficulty of distinguishing between discussion of issues on the one hand and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates on the other, the <em>Buckley </em>Court explained that analyzing the question in terms &#x93; &#x91;of intent and of effect&#x92; &#x94; would afford &#x93; &#x91;no security for free discussion.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id., </em>at 43 (quoting <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Collins</em>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">535</a> (1945)
).  It therefore rejected such an approach, and<em> McConnell </em>did not purport to overrule <em>Buckley</em> on this point&#x97;or even address what <em>Buckley </em>had to say on the subject.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">     For the reasons regarded as sufficient in <em>Buckley</em>, we decline to adopt a test for as-applied challenges turning on the speaker&#x92;s intent to affect an election.  The test to distinguish constitutionally protected political speech from speech that BCRA may proscribe should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights.  The test should also &#x93;reflec[t] our &#x91;profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 14 (quoting <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">270</a> (1964)
).  A test turning on the intent of the speaker does not remotely fit the bill.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Far from serving the values the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> is meant to protect, an intent-based test would chill core political speech by opening the door to a trial on every ad within the terms of &#xA7;203, on the theory that the speaker actually intended to affect an election, no matter how compelling the indications that the ad concerned a pending legislative or policy issue.  No reasonable speaker would choose to run an ad covered by BCRA if its only defense to a criminal prosecution would be that its motives were pure.  An intent-based standard &#x93;blankets with uncertainty whatever may be said,&#x94; and &#x93;offers no security for free discussion.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The FEC does not disagree.  In its brief filed in the first appeal in this litigation, it argued that a &#x93;constitutional standard that turned on the subjective sincerity of a speaker&#x92;s message would likely be incapable of workable application; at a minimum, it would invite costly, fact-dependent litigation.&#x94;  Brief for Appellee in <em>WRTL I</em>, O.

        <p class="bodytext">    A test focused on the speaker&#x92;s intent could lead to the bizarre result that identical ads aired at the same time could be protected speech for one speaker, while leading to criminal penalties for another.

.  An intent test provides none.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>Buckley </em>also explains the flaws of a test based on the actual effect speech will have on an election or on a particular segment of the target audience.

It would also typically lead to a burdensome, expert-driven inquiry, with an indeterminate result.  Litigation on such a standard may or may not accurately predict electoral effects, but it will unquestionably chill a substantial amount of political speech.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    In light of these considerations, a court should find that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  Under this test, WRTL&#x92;s three ads are plainly not the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  First, their content is consistent with that of a genuine issue ad: The ads focus on a legislative issue, take a position on the issue, exhort the public to adopt that position, and urge the public to contact public officials with respect to the matter.  Second, their content lacks indicia of express advocacy: The ads do not mention an election, candidacy, political party, or challenger; and they do not take a position on a candidate&#x92;s character, qualifications, or fitness for office.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Despite these characteristics, appellants assert that the content of WRTL&#x92;s ads alone betrays their electioneering nature.  Indeed, the FEC suggests that <em>any </em>ad covered by &#xA7;203 that includes &#x93;an appeal to citizens to contact their elected representative&#x94; is the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of an ad saying defeat or elect that candidate.  Brief for Appellant FEC 31; see Brief for Appellant Sen. John McCain et al<em>. </em>in No. 06&#x96;970, pp. 21&#x96;23 (hereinafter McCain Brief).  We do not agree.  To take just one example, during a blackout period the House considered the proposed Universal National Service Act.  See App. to Brief for American Center for Law and Justice et al<em>.</em> as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> B&#x96;3.  There would be no reason to regard an ad supporting or opposing that Act, and urging citizens to contact their Representative about it, as the equivalent of an ad saying vote for or against the Representative.  Issue advocacy conveys information and educates.  An issue ad&#x92;s impact on an election, if it exists at all, will come only after the voters hear the information and choose&#x97;uninvited by the ad&#x97;to factor it into their voting decisions.<a name="ZO-6ref" href="#ZO-6" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC and intervenors try to turn this difference to their advantage, citing <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s statements &#x93;that the most effective campaign ads, like the most effective commercials for products . . . avoid the [<em>Buckley</em>]<em/>magic words [expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate],&#x94; 540 U. S., at 127, and that advertisers &#x93;would seldom choose to use such words even if permitted,&#x94; <em>id.,</em> at 193.  See McCain Brief<em/>19.  An expert for the FEC in these cases relied on those observations to argue that WRTL&#x92;s ads are especially effective electioneering ads because they are &#x93;subtl[e],&#x94; focusing on issues rather than simply exhorting the electorate to vote against Senator Feingold.  App. 56&#x96;57.  Rephrased a bit, the argument perversely maintains that the <em>less </em>an issue ad resembles express advocacy, the more likely it is to be the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  This &#x93;heads I win, tails you lose&#x94; approach cannot be correct.  It would effectively eliminate 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> protection for genuine issue ads, contrary to our conclusion in <em>WRTL I </em>that as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203 are available, and our assumption in <em>McConnell</em> that &#x93;the interests that justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads,&#x94; 540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  Under appellants&#x92; view, there can be no such thing as a genuine issue ad during the blackout period&#x97;it is simply a very effective electioneering ad.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Looking beyond the content of WRTL&#x92;s ads, the FEC and intervenors argue that several &#x93;contextual&#x94; factors prove that the ads are the equivalent of express advocacy.  First, appellants cite evidence that during the same election cycle, WRTL and its Political Action Committee (PAC) actively opposed Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection and identified filibusters as a campaign issue.  This evidence goes to WRTL&#x92;s subjective intent in running the ads, and we have already explained that WRTL&#x92;s intent is irrelevant in an as-applied challenge.  Evidence of this sort is therefore beside the point, as it should be&#x97;WRTL does not forfeit its right to speak on issues simply because in other aspects of its work it also opposes candidates who are involved with those issues.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Next, the FEC and intervenors seize on the timing of WRTL&#x92;s ads.  They observe that the ads were to be aired near elections but not near actual Senate votes on judicial nominees, and that WRTL did not run the ads after the elections.  To the extent this evidence goes to WRTL&#x92;s subjective intent, it is again irrelevant.  To the extent it nonetheless suggests that the ads should be interpreted as express advocacy, it falls short.  That the ads were run close to an election is unremarkable in a challenge like this.  <em>Every </em>ad covered by BCRA &#xA7;203 will by definition air just before a primary or general election.  If this were enough to prove that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy, then BCRA would be constitutional in all of its applications.  This Court unanimously rejected this contention in <em>WRTL I</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    That the ads were run shortly after the Senate had recessed is likewise unpersuasive.  Members of Congress often return to their districts during recess, precisely to determine the views of their constituents; an ad run at that time may succeed in getting more constituents to contact the Representative while he or she is back home.  In any event, a group can certainly choose to run an issue ad to coincide with public interest rather than a floor vote.  Finally, WRTL did not resume running its ads after the BCRA blackout period because, as it explains, the debate had changed.  Brief for Appellee 16.  The focus of the Senate was on whether a majority would vote to change the Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster&#x97;not whether individual Senators would continue filibustering.  Given this change, WRTL&#x92;s decision not to continue running<span class="softbreak"/>its ads after the blackout period does not support an inference that the ads were the functional equivalent of electioneering.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The last piece of contextual evidence the FEC and intervenors highlight is the ads&#x92; &#x93;specific and repeated cross-reference&#x94; to a website.  Reply Brief for Appellant FEC 15.  In the middle of the website&#x92;s homepage, in large type, were the addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses of Senators Feingold and Kohl.  Wisconsinites who viewed &#x93;Wedding,&#x94; &#x93;Loan,&#x94; or &#x93;Waiting&#x94; and wished to contact their Senators&#x97;as the ads requested&#x97;would be able to obtain the pertinent contact information immediately upon visiting the website.  This is fully consistent with viewing WRTL&#x92;s ads as genuine issue ads.  The website also stated both Wisconsin Senators&#x92; positions on judicial filibusters, and allowed visitors to sign up for &#x93;e-alerts,&#x94; some of which contained exhortations to vote against Senator Feingold.  These details lend the electioneering interpretation of the ads more credence, but again, WRTL&#x92;s participation in express advocacy in other aspects of its work is not a justification for censoring its issue-related speech.  Any express advocacy on the website, already one step removed from the text of the ads themselves, certainly does not render an interpretation of the ads as genuine issue ads unreasonable.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given the standard we have adopted for determining whether an ad is the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy, contextual factors of the sort invoked by appellants should seldom play a significant role in the inquiry.  Courts need not ignore basic background information that may be necessary to put an ad in context&#x97;such as whether an ad &#x93;describes a legislative issue that is either currently the subject of legislative scrutiny or likely to be the subject of such scrutiny in the near future,&#x94; 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 207&#x97;but the need to consider such background should not become an excuse for discovery or a broader inquiry of the sort we have just noted raises 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> concerns.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At best, appellants have shown what we have acknowledged at least since <em>Buckley</em>: that &#x93;the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application.&#x94;  424 U. S., at 42.  Under the test set forth above, that is not enough to establish that the ads can only reasonably be viewed as advocating or opposing a candidate in a federal election.  &#x93;Freedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period.&#x94;  <em>Thornhill</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    BCRA &#xA7;203 can be constitutionally applied to WRTL&#x92;s ads only if it is narrowly tailored to further a compelling interest.  <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U.

This Court has never recognized a compelling interest in regulating ads, like WRTL&#x92;s, that are neither express advocacy nor its functional equivalent.  The District Court below considered interests that might justify regulating WRTL&#x92;s ads here, and found none sufficiently compelling.  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 208&#x96;210.  We reach the same conclusion.<a name="ZO-9ref" href="#ZO-9" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At the outset, we reject the contention that issue advocacy may be regulated because express election advocacy may be, and &#x93;the speech involved in so-called issue advocacy is [not] any more core political speech than are words of express advocacy.&#x94;  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 205.  This greater-includes-the-lesser approach is not how strict scrutiny works.  A corporate ad expressing support for the local football team could not be regulated on the ground that such speech is less &#x93;core&#x94; than corporate speech about an election, which we have held may be restricted.  A court applying strict scrutiny must ensure that a compelling interest supports <em>each application</em> of a statute restricting speech.  That a compelling interest justifies restrictions on express advocacy tells us little about whether a compelling interest justifies restrictions on issue advocacy; the <em>McConnell </em>Court itself made just that point.  See 540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  Such a greater-includes-the-lesser argument would dictate that virtually <em>all </em>corporate speech can be suppressed, since few kinds of speech can lay claim to being as central to the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> as campaign speech.  That conclusion is clearly foreclosed by our precedent.  See, <em>e.g.,</em>
            <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 776&#x96;777.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This Court has long recognized &#x93;the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption&#x94; in election campaigns.  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 45.  This interest has been invoked as a reason for upholding <em>contribution</em> limits.  As <em>Buckley </em>explained, &#x93;[t]o the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political <em>quid pro quo</em> from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 26&#x96;27.  We have suggested that this interest might also justify limits on electioneering <em>expenditures</em> because it may be that, in some circumstances, &#x93;large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements as do large contributions.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 45.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em> arguably applied this interest&#x97;which this Court had only assumed could justify regulation of express advocacy&#x97;to ads that were the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy.  See 540 U. S., at 204&#x96;206.  But to justify regulation of WRTL&#x92;s ads, this interest must be stretched yet another step to ads that are <em>not</em> the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Enough is enough.  Issue ads like WRTL&#x92;s are by no means equivalent to contributions, and the <em>quid-pro-quo </em>corruption interest cannot justify regulating them.  To equate WRTL&#x92;s ads with contributions is to ignore their value as political speech.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Appellants argue that an expansive definition of &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; is needed to ensure that issue advocacy does not circumvent the rule against express advocacy, which in turn helps protect against circumvention of the rule against contributions.  Cf. <em>McConnell, supra,</em> at 205 (&#x93;[R]ecent cases have recognized that certain restrictions on corporate electoral involvement permissibly hedge against circumvention of [valid] contribution limits&#x94; (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original)).  But such a prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis approach to regulating expression is not consistent with strict scrutiny.  &#x93;[T]he desire for a bright-line rule . . . hardly constitutes the <em>compelling </em>state interest necessary to justify any infringement on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> freedom.&#x94;  <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 263.  See <em>Free Speech Coalition</em>, 535 U. S., at 255 (&#x93;The Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech&#x94;); <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 44 (expenditure limitations &#x93;cannot be sustained simply by invoking the interest in maximizing the effectiveness of the less intrusive contribution limitations&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A second possible compelling interest recognized by this Court lies in addressing a &#x93;different type of corruption in the political arena: the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x94;  <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660.  <em>Austin </em>invoked this interest to uphold a state statute making it a felony for corporations to use treasury funds for independent expenditures on express election advocacy.  <em>Id.,</em> at 654&#x96;655.  <em>McConnell</em> also relied on this interest in upholding regulation not just of express advocacy, but also its &#x93;functional equivalent.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 205&#x96;206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These cases did not suggest, however, that the interest in combating &#x93;a different type of corruption&#x94; extended beyond campaign speech.  Quite the contrary.  Two of the Justices who joined the 6-to-3 majority in <em>Austin</em> relied, in upholding the constitutionality of the ban on campaign speech, on the fact that corporations retained freedom to speak on issues as distinct from election campaigns.  See 494 U. S., at 675&#x96;678 (Brennan, J., concurring) (describing fact that campaign speech ban &#x93;does not regulate corporate expenditures in referenda or other corporate expression&#x94; as &#x93;reflect[ing] the requirements of our decisions&#x94;); <em>id.,</em> at 678 (<span class="smallcaps">Stevens</span>, J., concurring) (&#x93;[T]here is a vast difference between lobbying and debating public issues on the one hand, and political campaigns for election to public office on the other&#x94;).  The <em>McConnell </em>Court similarly was willing to &#x93;assume that the interests that justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  And our decision in <em>WRTL I </em>reinforced the validity of that assumption by holding that BCRA &#xA7;203 is susceptible to as-applied challenges.  546 U. S., at 411&#x96;412.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Accepting the notion that a ban on campaign speech could also embrace issue advocacy would call into question our holding in <em>Bellotti</em> that the corporate identity of a speaker does not strip corporations of all free speech rights.  435 U. S., at 778.  It would be a constitutional &#x93;bait and switch&#x94; to conclude that corporate campaign speech may be banned in part <em>because </em>corporate issue advocacy is not, and then assert that corporate issue advocacy may be banned as well, pursuant to the same asserted compelling interest, through a broad conception of what constitutes the functional equivalent of campaign speech, or by relying on the inability to distinguish campaign speech from issue advocacy.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC and intervenors do not argue that the <em>Austin</em> interest justifies regulating genuine issue ads.  Instead, they focus on establishing that WRTL&#x92;s ads are the functional equivalent of express advocacy&#x97;a contention we have already rejected.  We hold that the interest recognized in <em>Austin</em> as justifying regulation of corporate campaign speech and extended in <em>McConnell</em> to the functional equivalent of such speech has no application to issue advocacy of the sort engaged in by WRTL.<a name="ZO-10ref" href="#ZO-10" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Because WRTL&#x92;s ads are not express advocacy or its functional equivalent, and because appellants identify no interest sufficiently compelling to justify burdening WRTL&#x92;s speech, we hold that BCRA &#xA7;203 is unconstitutional as applied to WRTL&#x92;s &#x93;Wedding,&#x94; &#x93;Loan,&#x94; and &#x93;Waiting&#x94; ads.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    These cases are about political speech.

        <p class="bodytext">    Yet, as is often the case in this Court&#x92;s 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> opinions, we have gotten this far in the analysis without quoting the Amendment itself: &#x93;Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.&#x94;  The Framers&#x92; actual words put these cases in proper perspective.  Our jurisprudence over the past 216 years has rejected an absolutist interpretation of those words, but when it comes to drawing difficult lines in the area of pure political speech&#x97;between what is protected and what the Government may ban&#x97;it is worth recalling the language we are applying.  <em>McConnell</em> held that express advocacy of a candidate or his opponent by a corporation shortly before an election may be prohibited, along with the functional equivalent of such express advocacy.  We have no occasion to revisit that determination today.  But when it comes to defining what speech qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy subject to such a ban&#x97;the issue we <em>do</em> have to decide&#x97;we give the benefit of the doubt to speech, not censorship.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>&#x92;s command that &#x93;Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech&#x94; demands at least that.</p>

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-4" href="#ZO-4ref">4</a> This is particularly true given that the methodology, data, and conclusions of the two studies were the subject of serious dispute among the District Court judges.  Compare McConnell v. FEC, 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 307&#x96;312 (DC 2003) (opinion of Henderson, J.) (stating that the studies were flawed and of limited evidentiary value), with id., at 585, 583&#x96;588 (opinion of Kollar-Kotelly, J.) (finding the studies generally credible, but stating that &#x93;I am troubled by the fact that coders in both studies were asked questions regarding their own perceptions of the advertisements&#x92; purposes, and that [some of] these perceptions were later recoded&#x94; by study supervisors).  Nothing in this Court&#x92;s opinion in McConnell suggests it was resolving the sharp disagreements about the evidentiary record in this respect.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-5" href="#ZO-5ref">5</a> Consider what happened in these cases.  The District Court permitted extensive discovery on the assumption that WRTL&#x92;s intent was relevant.  As a result, the defendants deposed WRTL&#x92;s executive director, its legislative director, its political action committee director, its lead communications consultant, and one of its fundraisers.  WRTL also had to turn over many documents related to its operations, plans, and finances.  Such litigation constitutes a severe burden on political speech.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-6" href="#ZO-6ref">6</a> For these reasons, we cannot agree with Justice Souter&#x92;s assertion that &#x93;anyone who heard the Feingold ads &#x2026; would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.&#x94;  Post, at 23.  The dissent supports this assertion by likening WRTL&#x92;s ads to the &#x93;Jane Doe&#x94; example identified in McConnell v. Federal Election Comm&#x92;n, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/540/93" class="subref" title="subref">540 U. S. 93</a> (2003)
.  But that ad &#x93;condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue.&#x94;  Post, at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).  WRTL&#x92;s ads do not do so; they instead take a position on the filibuster issue and exhort constituents to contact Senators Feingold and Kohl to advance that position.  Indeed, one would not even know from the ads whether Senator Feingold supported or opposed filibusters.  Justice Souter is confident Wisconsinites independently knew Senator Feingold&#x92;s position on filibusters, but we think that confidence misplaced.  A prominent study found, for example, that during the 2000 election cycle, 85 percent of respondents to a survey were not even able to name at least one candidate for the House of Representatives in their own district.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-7" href="#ZO-7ref">7</a> Justice Scalia thinks our test impermissibly vague.  See post, at 11&#x96;12 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  As should be evident, we agree with Justice Scalia on the imperative for clarity in this area; that is why our test affords protection unless an ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  It is why we emphasize that (1) there can be no free-ranging intent-and-effect test; (2) there generally should be no discovery or inquiry into the sort of &#x93;contextual&#x94; factors highlighted by the FEC and intervenors; (3) discussion of issues cannot be banned merely because the issues might be relevant to an election; and (4) in a debatable case, the tie is resolved in favor of protecting speech.  And keep in mind this test is only triggered if the speech meets the brightline requirements of BCRA &#xA7;203 in the first place.  Justice Scalia&#x92;s criticism of our test is all the more confusing because he accepts WRTL&#x92;s proposed three-prong test as &#x93;clear.&#x94;  Post, at 17.  We do not think our test any vaguer than WRTL&#x92;s, and it is more protective of political speech.


Justice Scalia also asserts that our test conflicts with Buckley v. Valeo, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
 (per curiam).  Post, at 13&#x96;16.  The Buckley Court confronted a statute restricting &#x93;any expenditure &#x2026; relative to a clearly identified candidate.&#x94;  424 U. S., at 42 (internal quotation marks omitted).  To avoid vagueness concerns, this Court first narrowed the statute to cover only expenditures expressly &#x93;advocating the election or defeat of a candidate&#x94;&#x97;using the so-called &#x93;magic words&#x94; of express advocacy.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court then proceeded to strike down the newly narrowed statute under strict scrutiny on the ground that its reach was not broad enough.  Id., at 44.  From this, Justice Scalia concludes that &#x93;[i]f a permissible test short of the magic-words test existed, Buckley would surely have adopted it.&#x94;  Post, at 14.  We are not so sure.  The question in Buckley was how a particular statutory provision could be construed to avoid vagueness concerns, not what the constitutional standard for clarity was in the abstract, divorced from specific statutory language.  Buckley&#x92;s intermediate step of statutory construction on the way to its constitutional holding does not dictate a constitutional test.  The Buckley Court&#x92;s &#x93;express advocacy restriction was an endpoint of statutory interpretation, not a first principle of constitutional law.&#x94;  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 190.  And despite Justice Scalia&#x92;s claim to the contrary, our citation of Buckley along with other decisions in rejecting an intent-and-effect test does not force us to adopt (or reject) Buckley&#x92;s statutory construction as a constitutional test.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-8" href="#ZO-8ref">8</a> Nothing in McConnell&#x92;s statement that the &#x93;vast majority&#x94; of issue ads broadcast in the periods preceding federal elections had an &#x93;electioneering purpose&#x94; forecloses this conclusion.  540 U. S., at 206.  Courts do not resolve unspecified as-applied challenges in the course of resolving a facial attack, so McConnell could not have settled the issue we address today.

 (&#x93;The fact that [a law] is capable of valid applications does not necessarily mean that it is valid as applied to these litigants&#x94;).  Indeed, WRTL I confirmed as much.  546 U. S., at 411&#x96;412.  By the same token, in deciding this as-applied challenge, we have no occasion to revisit McConnell&#x92;s conclusion that the statute is not facially overbroad.


The &#x93;vast majority&#x94; language, moreover, is beside the point.  The McConnell Court did not find that a &#x93;vast majority&#x94; of the issue ads considered were the functional equivalent of direct advocacy.  Rather, it found that such ads had an &#x93;electioneering purpose.&#x94;  For the reasons we have explained, &#x93;purpose&#x94; is not the appropriate test for distinguishing between genuine issue ads and the functional equivalent of express campaign advocacy.  See supra, at 14&#x96;15.  In addition, the &#x93;vast majority&#x94; statement was not necessary to the Court&#x92;s facial holding in McConnell.  The standard required for a statute to survive an overbreadth challenge is not that the &#x93;vast majority&#x94; of a statute&#x92;s applications be legitimate.  &#x93;[B]road language . . . unnecessary to the Court&#x92;s decision &#x2026; cannot be considered binding authority.&#x94;  Kastigar v.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-9" href="#ZO-9ref">9</a> The dissent stresses a number of points that, while not central to our decision, nevertheless merit a response.  First, the dissent overstates its case when it asserts that the &#x93;PAC alternative&#x94; gives corporations a constitutionally sufficient outlet to speak.  See post, at 30.  PACs impose well-documented and onerous burdens, particularly on small nonprofits.  See MCFL, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/479/238" class="subref" title="subref">479 U. S. 238</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">253</a>&#x96;255 (1986)
 (plurality opinion).  McConnell did conclude that segregated funds &#x93;provid[e] corporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy&#x94; and its functional equivalent, 540 U. S., at 203, but that holding did not extend beyond functional equivalents&#x97;and if it did, the PAC option would justify regulation of all corporate speech, a proposition we have rejected, see Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 777&#x96;778.  Second, the response that a speaker should just take out a newspaper ad, or use a website, rather than complain that it cannot speak through a broadcast communication, see post, at 18&#x96;19, 33, is too glib.  Even assuming for the sake of argument that the possibility of using a different medium of communication has relevance in determining the permissibility of a limitation on speech, newspaper ads and websites are not reasonable alternatives to broadcast speech in terms of impact and effectiveness.  See McConnell v. FEC, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 569&#x96;573, 646 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.).  Third, we disagree with the dissent&#x92;s view that corporations can still speak by changing what they say to avoid mentioning candidates, post, at 30&#x96;31.  That argument is akin to telling Cohen that he cannot wear his jacket because he is free to wear one that says &#x93;I disagree with the draft,&#x94; cf. Cohen v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/15" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 15</a> (1971)
, or telling 44 Liquormart that it can advertise so long as it avoids mentioning prices, cf. 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/484" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 484</a> (1996)
.  Such notions run afoul of &#x93;the fundamental rule of protection under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.&#x94;  Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/540/93" class="subref" title="subref">540 U. S. 93</a> (2003)
, this Court considered whether &#xA7;203 was facially overbroad under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> because it captured within its reach not only campaign speech, or &#x93;express advocacy,&#x94; but also speech about public issues more generally, or &#x93;issue advocacy,&#x94; that mentions a candidate for federal office.  The Court concluded that there was no overbreadth concern to the extent the speech in question was the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express campaign speech.  <em>Id.</em>, at 204&#x96;205, 206.  On the other hand, the Court &#x93;assume[d]&#x94; that the interests it had found to &#x93;justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads.&#x94;  <em>Id., </em>at 206, n. 88.  The Court nonetheless determined that &#xA7;203 was not facially overbroad.  Even assuming &#xA7;203 &#x93;inhibit[ed] some constitutionally protected corporate and union speech,&#x94; the Court concluded that those challenging the law on its face had failed to carry their &#x93;heavy burden&#x94; of establishing that <em>all </em>enforcement of the law should therefore be prohibited.  <em>Id.,</em> at 207.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Last Term, we reversed a lower court ruling, arising in the same litigation before us now, that our decision in <em>McConnell</em> left &#x93;no room&#x94; for as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203.

        <p class="bodytext">    We now confront such an as-applied challenge.  Resolving it requires us first to determine whether the speech at issue is the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of speech expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office, or instead a &#x93;genuine issue a[d].&#x94;  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 206, and n. 88. <em/>We have long recognized that the distinction between campaign advocacy and issue advocacy &#x93;may often dissolve in practical application.

 (<em>per curiam</em>).  Our development of the law in this area requires us, however, to draw such a line, because we have recognized that the interests held to justify the regulation of campaign speech and its &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; &#x93;might not apply&#x94; to the regulation of issue advocacy.  <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 206, and n. 88.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In drawing that line, the

We further conclude that the interests held to justify restricting corporate campaign speech or its functional equivalent do not justify restricting issue advocacy, and accordingly we hold that BCRA &#xA7;203 is unconstitutional as applied to the advertisements at issue in these cases.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Just before the BCRA blackout period was to begin, the District Court denied a preliminary injunction, concluding that &#x93;the reasoning of the <em>McConnell</em> Court leaves no room for the kind of &#x91;as applied&#x92; challenge WRTL propounds before us.&#x94;  App. to Juris. Statement 52a.  In response to this ruling, WRTL did not run its ads during the blackout period.  The District Court subsequently dismissed WRTL&#x92;s complaint.  See <em>id.,</em> at 47a&#x96;48a (&#x93;WRTL&#x92;s &#x91;as-applied&#x92; challenge to BCRA [&#xA7;203] is foreclosed by the Supreme Court&#x92;s decision in <em>McConnell</em>&#x94;).  On appeal, we vacated the District Court&#x92;s judgment, holding that <em>McConnell</em> &#x93;did not purport to resolve future as-applied challenges&#x94; to BCRA &#xA7;203, and remanded &#x93;for the District Court to consider the merits of WRTL&#x92;s as-applied challenge in the first instance.&#x94;  <em>WRTL I</em>, 546 U. S., at 412.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On remand, after allowing four Members of Congress to intervene as defendants, the three-judge District Court granted summary judgment for WRTL, holding BCRA &#xA7;203 unconstitutional as applied to the three advertisements WRTL planned to run during the 2004 blackout period.  The District Court first found adjudication of the dispute not barred by mootness because the controversy was &#x93; &#x91;capable of repetition, yet evading review.&#x92; &#x94;  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 202.  Turning to the merits, the court began by noting that under <em>McConnell</em>, BCRA could constitutionally proscribe &#x93;express advocacy&#x94;&#x97;defined as ads that expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate for federal office&#x97;and the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of such advocacy.  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 204.  Stating that it was limiting its inquiry to &#x93;language within the four corners&#x94; of the ads, <em>id.,</em> at 207, the District Court concluded that the ads were <em>not</em> express advocacy or its functional equivalent, but instead &#x93;genuine issue ads.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 205&#x96;208.  Then, reaching a question &#x93;left open in <em>McConnell</em>,&#x94; the court held that no compelling interest justified BCRA&#x92;s regulation of genuine issue ads such as those WRTL sought to run.  <em>Id., </em>at 208&#x96;210.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    One judge dissented, contending that the majority&#x92;s &#x93;plain facial analysis of the text in WRTL&#x92;s 2004 advertisements&#x94; ignored &#x93;the context in which the text was developed.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 210 (opinion of Roberts, J.).  In that judge&#x92;s view, a contextual analysis of the ads revealed &#x93;deep factual rifts between the parties concerning the purpose and intended effects of the ads&#x94; such that neither side was entitled to summary judgment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 210, 211.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC and intervenors filed separate notices of appeal and jurisdictional statements.

.  Based on these principles, the FEC argues (though the intervenors do not) that these cases are moot because the 2004 election has passed and WRTL &#x93;does not assert any continuing interest in running [its three] advertisements, nor does it identify any reason to believe that a significant dispute over Senate filibusters of judicial nominees will occur in the foreseeable future.&#x94;  Brief for Appellant FEC 21.</p>

But groups like WRTL cannot predict what issues will be matters of public concern during a future blackout period.  In these cases, WRTL had no way of knowing well in advance that it would want to run ads on judicial filibusters during the BCRA blackout period.

        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC asks for too much.  We have recognized that the &#x93; &#x91;capable of repetition, yet evading review&#x92; doctrine, in the context of election cases, is appropriate when there are &#x91;as applied&#x92; challenges as well as in the more typical case involving only facial attacks.&#x94;  <em>Storer</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/415/724" class="subref" title="subref">415 U. S. 724</a>, n. 8 (1974).  Requiring repetition of every &#x93;legally relevant&#x94; characteristic of an as-applied challenge&#x97;down to the last detail&#x97;would effectively overrule this statement by making this exception unavailable for virtually all as-applied challenges.  History repeats itself, but not at the level of specificity demanded by the FEC.  Here, WRTL credibly claimed that it planned on running &#x93; &#x91;materially similar&#x92; &#x94; future targeted broadcast ads mentioning a candidate within the blackout period, 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 197, and there is no reason to believe that the FEC will &#x93;refrain from prosecuting violations&#x94; of BCRA, <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 775.  Under the circumstances, particularly where WRTL sought another preliminary injunction based on an ad it planned to run during the 2006 blackout period, see 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 203, n. 15, we hold that there exists a reasonable expectation that the same controversy involving the same party will recur.  We have jurisdiction to decide these cases.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL rightly concedes that its ads are prohibited by BCRA &#xA7;203.  Each ad clearly identifies Senator Feingold, who was running (unopposed) in the Wisconsin Democratic primary on September 14, 2004, and each ad would have been &#x93;targeted to the relevant electorate,&#x94; see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_C" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(C)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV), during the BCRA blackout period.  WRTL further concedes that its ads do not fit under any of BCRA&#x92;s exceptions to the term &#x93;electioneering communication.&#x94;  See &#xA7;434(f)(3)(B).  The only question, then, is whether it is consistent with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> for BCRA &#xA7;203 to prohibit WRTL from running these three ads.</p>

These cases, however, present the separate question whether &#xA7;203 may constitutionally be applied to these specific ads.  Because BCRA &#xA7;203 burdens political speech, it is subject to strict scrutiny.  See <em>McConnell</em>,<em/>540 U. S., at 205; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/494/652" class="subref" title="subref">494 U. S. 652</a>,

; <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 252 (plurality opinion); <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 786; <em>Buckley</em>,<em/>424 U. S., at 44&#x96;45.  Under strict scrutiny, the <em>Government</em> must prove that applying BCRA to WRTL&#x92;s ads furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest.  See <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 786 (&#x93;Especially where, as here, a prohibition is directed at speech itself, and the speech is intimately related to the process of governing, &#x2026; &#x91;the burden is on the government to show the existence of [a compelling] interest&#x92; &#x94; (footnote omitted)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The strict scrutiny analysis is, of course, informed by our precedents.  This Court has already ruled that BCRA survives strict scrutiny to the extent it regulates express advocacy or its functional equivalent.  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 206.  So to the extent the ads in these cases fit this description, the FEC&#x92;s burden is not onerous; all it need do is point to <em>McConnell </em>and explain why it applies here.  If, on the other hand, WRTL&#x92;s ads are <em>not </em>express advocacy or its equivalent, the Government&#x92;s task is more formidable.  It must then demonstrate that banning such ads during the blackout periods is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest.  No precedent of this Court has yet reached that conclusion.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC, intervenors, and the dissent below contend that <em>McConnell</em> already established the constitutional test for determining if an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy: whether the ad is intended to influence elections and has that effect.  See, <em>e.g., </em>466 F. Supp. 2d, at 214 (opinion of Roberts, J.).  Here is the relevant portion of our opinion in <em>McConnell</em>:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;[P]laintiffs argue that the justifications that adequately support the regulation of express advocacy do not apply to significant quantities of speech encompassed by the definition of electioneering communications.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;This argument fails to the extent that the issue ads broadcast during the 30- and 60-day periods preceding federal primary and general elections are the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  The justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during those periods if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;<em/>540 U. S., at 205&#x96;206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL and the District Court majority, on the other hand, claim that <em>McConnell </em>did not adopt any test as the standard for future as-applied challenges.  We agree.  <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>analysis was grounded in the evidentiary record before the Court.  Two key studies in the <em>McConnell </em>record constituted &#x93;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions in support of their constitutional validity.&#x94;  <em>McConnell </em>v. <em>FEC</em>, 251 F. Supp. 2d 176, 307, 308 (DC 2003) (opinion of Henderson, J.) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those studies asked &#x93;student coders&#x94; to separate ads based on whether the students thought the &#x93;purpose&#x94; of the ad was &#x93;to provide information about or urge action on a bill or issue,&#x94; or &#x93;to generate support or opposition for a particular candidate.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 308&#x96;309 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted); see Brief for Appellee 38.  The studies concluded &#x93; &#x91;that BCRA&#x92;s definition of Electioneering Communications accurately captures those ads that <em>have the purpose or effect of supporting candidates for election to office</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis in original).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When the <em>McConnell</em> Court considered the possible facial overbreadth of &#xA7;203, it looked to the studies in the record analyzing ads broadcast during the blackout periods, and those studies had classified the ads in terms of intent and effect.  The Court&#x92;s assessment was accordingly phrased in the same terms, which the Court regarded as sufficient to conclude, on the record before it, that the plaintiffs had not &#x93;carried their heavy burden of proving&#x94; that &#xA7;203 was facially overbroad and could not be enforced in <em>any </em>circumstances.  540 U. S., at 207.  The Court did not explain that it was adopting a particular test for determining what constituted the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy.  The fact that the student coders who helped develop the evidentiary record before the Court in <em>McConnell</em> looked to intent and effect in doing so, and that the Court dealt with the record on that basis in deciding the facial overbreadth claim, neither compels nor warrants accepting that same standard as the constitutional test for separating, in an as-applied challenge, political speech protected under the

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    More importantly, this Court in <em>Buckley</em> had already rejected an intent-and-effect test for distinguishing between discussions of issues and candidates.  See 424 U. S., at 43&#x96;44.  After noting the difficulty of distinguishing between discussion of issues on the one hand and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates on the other, the <em>Buckley </em>Court explained that analyzing the question in terms &#x93; &#x91;of intent and of effect&#x92; &#x94; would afford &#x93; &#x91;no security for free discussion.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id., </em>at 43 (quoting <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Collins</em>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">535</a> (1945)
).  It therefore rejected such an approach, and<em> McConnell </em>did not purport to overrule <em>Buckley</em> on this point&#x97;or even address what <em>Buckley </em>had to say on the subject.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">     For the reasons regarded as sufficient in <em>Buckley</em>, we decline to adopt a test for as-applied challenges turning on the speaker&#x92;s intent to affect an election.  The test to distinguish constitutionally protected political speech from speech that BCRA may proscribe should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights.  The test should also &#x93;reflec[t] our &#x91;profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 14 (quoting <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/376/254" class="subref" title="subref">376 U. S. 254</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">270</a> (1964)
).  A test turning on the intent of the speaker does not remotely fit the bill.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Far from serving the values the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> is meant to protect, an intent-based test would chill core political speech by opening the door to a trial on every ad within the terms of &#xA7;203, on the theory that the speaker actually intended to affect an election, no matter how compelling the indications that the ad concerned a pending legislative or policy issue.  No reasonable speaker would choose to run an ad covered by BCRA if its only defense to a criminal prosecution would be that its motives were pure.  An intent-based standard &#x93;blankets with uncertainty whatever may be said,&#x94; and &#x93;offers no security for free discussion.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The FEC does not disagree.  In its brief filed in the first appeal in this litigation, it argued that a &#x93;constitutional standard that turned on the subjective sincerity of a speaker&#x92;s message would likely be incapable of workable application; at a minimum, it would invite costly, fact-dependent litigation.&#x94;  Brief for Appellee in <em>WRTL I</em>, O.

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A test focused on the speaker&#x92;s intent could lead to the bizarre result that identical ads aired at the same time could be protected speech for one speaker, while leading to criminal penalties for another.  See M. Redish, Money Talks: Speech, Economic Power, and the Values of Democracy 91 (2001) (&#x93;[U]nder well-accepted

.  An intent test provides none.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>Buckley </em>also explains the flaws of a test based on the actual effect speech will have on an election or on a particular segment of the target audience.  Such a test &#x93; &#x91;puts the speaker &#x2026; wholly at the mercy of the varied understanding of his hearers.&#x92; &#x94;  424 U. S., at 43.  It would also typically lead to a burdensome, expert-driven inquiry, with an indeterminate result.  Litigation on such a standard may or may not accurately predict electoral effects, but it will unquestionably chill a substantial amount of political speech.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;The freedom of speech &#x2026; guaranteed by the Constitution embraces at the least the liberty to discuss publicly and truthfully all matters of public concern without previous restraint or fear of subsequent punishment.&#x94;  <em>Bellotti</em>, 435 U.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">534</a> (1980)
.  To safeguard this liberty, the proper standard for an as-applied challenge to BCRA &#xA7;203 must be objective, focusing on the substance of the communication rather than amorphous considerations of intent and effect.  See <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra, </em>at 43&#x96;44. <em/>It must entail minimal if any discovery, to allow parties to resolve disputes quickly without chilling speech through the threat of burdensome litigation.

.  In short, it must give the benefit of any doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech.  See <em>New York Times Co.</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 269&#x96;270.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In light of these considerations, a court should find that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy only if the ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  Under this test, WRTL&#x92;s three ads are plainly not the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  First, their content is consistent with that of a genuine issue ad: The ads focus on a legislative issue, take a position on the issue, exhort the public to adopt that position, and urge the public to contact public officials with respect to the matter.  Second, their content lacks indicia of express advocacy: The ads do not mention an election, candidacy, political party, or challenger; and they do not take a position on a candidate&#x92;s character, qualifications, or fitness for office.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Despite these characteristics, appellants assert that the content of WRTL&#x92;s ads alone betrays their electioneering nature.  Indeed, the FEC suggests that <em>any </em>ad covered by &#xA7;203 that includes &#x93;an appeal to citizens to contact their elected representative&#x94; is the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of an ad saying defeat or elect that candidate.

To take just one example, during a blackout period the House considered the proposed Universal National Service Act.  See App. to Brief for American Center for Law and Justice et al<em>.</em> as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> B&#x96;3.  There would be no reason to regard an ad supporting or opposing that Act, and urging citizens to contact their Representative about it, as the equivalent of an ad saying vote for or against the Representative.  Issue advocacy conveys information and educates.  An issue ad&#x92;s impact on an election, if it exists at all, will come only after the voters hear the information and choose&#x97;uninvited by the ad&#x97;to factor it into their voting decisions.<a name="ZO-6ref" href="#ZO-6" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC and intervenors try to turn this difference to their advantage, citing <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s statements &#x93;that the most effective campaign ads, like the most effective commercials for products . . . avoid the [<em>Buckley</em>]<em/>magic words [expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate],&#x94; 540 U. S., at 127, and that advertisers &#x93;would seldom choose to use such words even if permitted,&#x94; <em>id.,</em> at 193.  See McCain Brief<em/>19.  An expert for the FEC in these cases relied on those observations to argue that WRTL&#x92;s ads are especially effective electioneering ads because they are &#x93;subtl[e],&#x94; focusing on issues rather than simply exhorting the electorate to vote against Senator Feingold.  App. 56&#x96;57.  Rephrased a bit, the argument perversely maintains that the <em>less </em>an issue ad resembles express advocacy, the more likely it is to be the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  This &#x93;heads I win, tails you lose&#x94; approach cannot be correct.  It would effectively eliminate 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> protection for genuine issue ads, contrary to our conclusion in <em>WRTL I </em>that as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203 are available, and our assumption in <em>McConnell</em> that &#x93;the interests that justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads,&#x94; 540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  Under appellants&#x92; view, there can be no such thing as a genuine issue ad during the blackout period&#x97;it is simply a very effective electioneering ad.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Looking beyond the content of WRTL&#x92;s ads, the FEC and intervenors argue that several &#x93;contextual&#x94; factors prove that the ads are the equivalent of express advocacy.  First, appellants cite evidence that during the same election cycle, WRTL and its Political Action Committee (PAC) actively opposed Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection and identified filibusters as a campaign issue.  This evidence goes to WRTL&#x92;s subjective intent in running the ads, and we have already explained that WRTL&#x92;s intent is irrelevant in an as-applied challenge.  Evidence of this sort is therefore beside the point, as it should be&#x97;WRTL does not forfeit its right to speak on issues simply because in other aspects of its work it also opposes candidates who are involved with those issues.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Next, the FEC and intervenors seize on the timing of WRTL&#x92;s ads.  They observe that the ads were to be aired near elections but not near actual Senate votes on judicial nominees, and that WRTL did not run the ads after the elections.  To the extent this evidence goes to WRTL&#x92;s subjective intent, it is again irrelevant.  To the extent it nonetheless suggests that the ads should be interpreted as express advocacy, it falls short.  That the ads were run close to an election is unremarkable in a challenge like this.  <em>Every </em>ad covered by BCRA &#xA7;203 will by definition air just before a primary or general election.  If this were enough to prove that an ad is the functional equivalent of express advocacy, then BCRA would be constitutional in all of its applications.  This Court unanimously rejected this contention in <em>WRTL I</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    That the ads were run shortly after the Senate had recessed is likewise unpersuasive.  Members of Congress often return to their districts during recess, precisely to determine the views of their constituents; an ad run at that time may succeed in getting more constituents to contact the Representative while he or she is back home.  In any event, a group can certainly choose to run an issue ad to coincide with public interest rather than a floor vote.  Finally, WRTL did not resume running its ads after the BCRA blackout period because, as it explains, the debate had changed.  Brief for Appellee 16.  The focus of the Senate was on whether a majority would vote to change the Senate rules to eliminate the filibuster&#x97;not whether individual Senators would continue filibustering.  Given this change, WRTL&#x92;s decision not to continue running<span class="softbreak"/>its ads after the blackout period does not support an inference that the ads were the functional equivalent of electioneering.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The last piece of contextual evidence the FEC and intervenors highlight is the ads&#x92; &#x93;specific and repeated cross-reference&#x94; to a website.  Reply Brief for Appellant FEC 15.  In the middle of the website&#x92;s homepage, in large type, were the addresses, phone numbers, fax numbers, and email addresses of Senators Feingold and Kohl.  Wisconsinites who viewed &#x93;Wedding,&#x94; &#x93;Loan,&#x94; or &#x93;Waiting&#x94; and wished to contact their Senators&#x97;as the ads requested&#x97;would be able to obtain the pertinent contact information immediately upon visiting the website.  This is fully consistent with viewing WRTL&#x92;s ads as genuine issue ads.  The website also stated both Wisconsin Senators&#x92; positions on judicial filibusters, and allowed visitors to sign up for &#x93;e-alerts,&#x94; some of which contained exhortations to vote against Senator Feingold.  These details lend the electioneering interpretation of the ads more credence, but again, WRTL&#x92;s participation in express advocacy in other aspects of its work is not a justification for censoring its issue-related speech.  Any express advocacy on the website, already one step removed from the text of the ads themselves, certainly does not render an interpretation of the ads as genuine issue ads unreasonable.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given the standard we have adopted for determining whether an ad is the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy, contextual factors of the sort invoked by appellants should seldom play a significant role in the inquiry.  Courts need not ignore basic background information that may be necessary to put an ad in context&#x97;such as whether an ad &#x93;describes a legislative issue that is either currently the subject of legislative scrutiny or likely to be the subject of such scrutiny in the near future,&#x94; 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 207&#x97;but the need to consider such background should not become an excuse for discovery or a broader inquiry of the sort we have just noted raises 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> concerns.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At best, appellants have shown what we have acknowledged at least since <em>Buckley</em>: that &#x93;the distinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical application.&#x94;  424 U. S., at 42.  Under the test set forth above, that is not enough to establish that the ads can only reasonably be viewed as advocating or opposing a candidate in a federal election.  &#x93;Freedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period.&#x94;  <em>Thornhill</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>,

This Court has never recognized a compelling interest in regulating ads, like WRTL&#x92;s, that are neither express advocacy nor its functional equivalent.  The District Court below considered interests that might justify regulating WRTL&#x92;s ads here, and found none sufficiently compelling.  466 F. Supp. 2d, at 208&#x96;210.

        <p class="bodytext">    At the outset, we reject the contention that issue advocacy may be regulated because express election advocacy may be, and &#x93;the speech involved in so-called issue advocacy is [not] any more core political speech than are words of express advocacy.&#x94;  <em>McConnell</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 205.  This greater-includes-the-lesser approach is not how strict scrutiny works.  A corporate ad expressing support for the local football team could not be regulated on the ground that such speech is less &#x93;core&#x94; than corporate speech about an election, which we have held may be restricted.  A court applying strict scrutiny must ensure that a compelling interest supports <em>each application</em> of a statute restricting speech.  That a compelling interest justifies restrictions on express advocacy tells us little about whether a compelling interest justifies restrictions on issue advocacy; the <em>McConnell </em>Court itself made just that point.  See 540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  Such a greater-includes-the-lesser argument would dictate that virtually <em>all </em>corporate speech can be suppressed, since few kinds of speech can lay claim to being as central to the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> as campaign speech.  That conclusion is clearly foreclosed by our precedent.  See, <em>e.g.,</em>
            <em>Bellotti</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 776&#x96;777.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This Court has long recognized &#x93;the governmental interest in preventing corruption and the appearance of corruption&#x94; in election campaigns.  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 45.  This interest has been invoked as a reason for upholding <em>contribution</em> limits.  As <em>Buckley </em>explained, &#x93;[t]o the extent that large contributions are given to secure a political <em>quid pro quo</em> from current and potential office holders, the integrity of our system of representative democracy is undermined.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 26&#x96;27.  We have suggested that this interest might also justify limits on electioneering <em>expenditures</em> because it may be that, in some circumstances, &#x93;large independent expenditures pose the same dangers of actual or apparent <em>quid pro quo</em> arrangements as do large contributions.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 45.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em> arguably applied this interest&#x97;which this Court had only assumed could justify regulation of express advocacy&#x97;to ads that were the &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; of express advocacy.  See 540 U. S., at 204&#x96;206.  But to justify regulation of WRTL&#x92;s ads, this interest must be stretched yet another step to ads that are <em>not</em> the functional equivalent of express advocacy.  Enough is enough.  Issue ads like WRTL&#x92;s are by no means equivalent to contributions, and the <em>quid-pro-quo </em>corruption interest cannot justify regulating them.  To equate WRTL&#x92;s ads with contributions is to ignore their value as political speech.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Appellants argue that an expansive definition of &#x93;functional equivalent&#x94; is needed to ensure that issue advocacy does not circumvent the rule against express advocacy, which in turn helps protect against circumvention of the rule against contributions.  Cf. <em>McConnell, supra,</em> at 205 (&#x93;[R]ecent cases have recognized that certain restrictions on corporate electoral involvement permissibly hedge against circumvention of [valid] contribution limits&#x94; (internal quotation marks omitted; brackets in original)).  But such a prophylaxis-upon-prophylaxis approach to regulating expression is not consistent with strict scrutiny.  &#x93;[T]he desire for a bright-line rule . . . hardly constitutes the <em>compelling </em>state interest necessary to justify any infringement on 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> freedom.&#x94;  <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 263.  See <em>Free Speech Coalition</em>, 535 U. S., at 255 (&#x93;The Government may not suppress lawful speech as the means to suppress unlawful speech&#x94;); <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 44 (expenditure limitations &#x93;cannot be sustained simply by invoking the interest in maximizing the effectiveness of the less intrusive contribution limitations&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A second possible compelling interest recognized by this Court lies in addressing a &#x93;different type of corruption in the political arena: the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x94;  <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660.  <em>Austin </em>invoked this interest to uphold a state statute making it a felony for corporations to use treasury funds for independent expenditures on express election advocacy.  <em>Id.,</em> at 654&#x96;655.  <em>McConnell</em> also relied on this interest in upholding regulation not just of express advocacy, but also its &#x93;functional equivalent.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 205&#x96;206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These cases did not suggest, however, that the interest in combating &#x93;a different type of corruption&#x94; extended beyond campaign speech.  Quite the contrary.  Two of the Justices who joined the 6-to-3 majority in <em>Austin</em> relied, in upholding the constitutionality of the ban on campaign speech, on the fact that corporations retained freedom to speak on issues as distinct from election campaigns.  See 494 U. S., at 675&#x96;678 (Brennan, J., concurring) (describing fact that campaign speech ban &#x93;does not regulate corporate expenditures in referenda or other corporate expression&#x94; as &#x93;reflect[ing] the requirements of our decisions&#x94;); <em>id.,</em> at 678 (<span class="smallcaps">Stevens</span>, J., concurring) (&#x93;[T]here is a vast difference between lobbying and debating public issues on the one hand, and political campaigns for election to public office on the other&#x94;).  The <em>McConnell </em>Court similarly was willing to &#x93;assume that the interests that justify the regulation of campaign speech might not apply to the regulation of genuine issue ads.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206, n. 88.  And our decision in <em>WRTL I </em>reinforced the validity of that assumption by holding that BCRA &#xA7;203 is susceptible to as-applied challenges.  546 U. S., at 411&#x96;412.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Accepting the notion that a ban on campaign speech could also embrace issue advocacy would call into question our holding in <em>Bellotti</em> that the corporate identity of a speaker does not strip corporations of all free speech rights.  435 U. S., at 778.  It would be a constitutional &#x93;bait and switch&#x94; to conclude that corporate campaign speech may be banned in part <em>because </em>corporate issue advocacy is not, and then assert that corporate issue advocacy may be banned as well, pursuant to the same asserted compelling interest, through a broad conception of what constitutes the functional equivalent of campaign speech, or by relying on the inability to distinguish campaign speech from issue advocacy.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The FEC and intervenors do not argue that the <em>Austin</em> interest justifies regulating genuine issue ads.  Instead, they focus on establishing that WRTL&#x92;s ads are the functional equivalent of express advocacy&#x97;a contention we have already rejected.  We hold that the interest recognized in <em>Austin</em> as justifying regulation of corporate campaign speech and extended in <em>McConnell</em> to the functional equivalent of such speech has no application to issue advocacy of the sort engaged in by WRTL.<a name="ZO-10ref" href="#ZO-10" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Because WRTL&#x92;s ads are not express advocacy or its functional equivalent, and because appellants identify no interest sufficiently compelling to justify burdening WRTL&#x92;s speech, we hold that BCRA &#xA7;203 is unconstitutional as applied to WRTL&#x92;s &#x93;Wedding,&#x94; &#x93;Loan,&#x94; and &#x93;Waiting&#x94; ads.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    These cases are about political speech.

        <p class="bodytext">    Yet, as is often the case in this Court&#x92;s 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> opinions, we have gotten this far in the analysis without quoting the Amendment itself: &#x93;Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech.&#x94;  The Framers&#x92; actual words put these cases in proper perspective.  Our jurisprudence over the past 216 years has rejected an absolutist interpretation of those words, but when it comes to drawing difficult lines in the area of pure political speech&#x97;between what is protected and what the Government may ban&#x97;it is worth recalling the language we are applying.  <em>McConnell</em> held that express advocacy of a candidate or his opponent by a corporation shortly before an election may be prohibited, along with the functional equivalent of such express advocacy.  We have no occasion to revisit that determination today.  But when it comes to defining what speech qualifies as the functional equivalent of express advocacy subject to such a ban&#x97;the issue we <em>do</em> have to decide&#x97;we give the benefit of the doubt to speech, not censorship.  The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>&#x92;s command that &#x93;Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech&#x94; demands at least that.</p>

The dissent supports this assertion by likening WRTL&#x92;s ads to the &#x93;Jane Doe&#x94; example identified in McConnell v. Federal Election Comm&#x92;n, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/540/93" class="subref" title="subref">540 U. S. 93</a> (2003)
.  But that ad &#x93;condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue.&#x94;  Post, at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted).  WRTL&#x92;s ads do not do so; they instead take a position on the filibuster issue and exhort constituents to contact Senators Feingold and Kohl to advance that position.  Indeed, one would not even know from the ads whether Senator Feingold supported or opposed filibusters.  Justice Souter is confident Wisconsinites independently knew Senator Feingold&#x92;s position on filibusters, but we think that confidence misplaced.  A prominent study found, for example, that during the 2000 election cycle, 85 percent of respondents to a survey were not even able to name at least one candidate for the House of Representatives in their own district.  See Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research, American National Election Study, 2000: Pre- and Post-Election Survey 243 (N. Burns et al. eds. 2002) online at http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/cocoon/ICPSR/STUDY/03131.xml (as visited June 22, 2007, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-7" href="#ZO-7ref">7</a> Justice Scalia thinks our test impermissibly vague.  See post, at 11&#x96;12 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  As should be evident, we agree with Justice Scalia on the imperative for clarity in this area; that is why our test affords protection unless an ad is susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.  It is why we emphasize that (1) there can be no free-ranging intent-and-effect test; (2) there generally should be no discovery or inquiry into the sort of &#x93;contextual&#x94; factors highlighted by the FEC and intervenors; (3) discussion of issues cannot be banned merely because the issues might be relevant to an election; and (4) in a debatable case, the tie is resolved in favor of protecting speech.  And keep in mind this test is only triggered if the speech meets the brightline requirements of BCRA &#xA7;203 in the first place.  Justice Scalia&#x92;s criticism of our test is all the more confusing because he accepts WRTL&#x92;s proposed three-prong test as &#x93;clear.&#x94;  Post, at 17.  We do not think our test any vaguer than WRTL&#x92;s, and it is more protective of political speech.


Justice Scalia also asserts that our test conflicts with Buckley v. Valeo, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
 (per curiam).  Post, at 13&#x96;16.  The Buckley Court confronted a statute restricting &#x93;any expenditure &#x2026; relative to a clearly identified candidate.&#x94;  424 U. S., at 42 (internal quotation marks omitted).  To avoid vagueness concerns, this Court first narrowed the statute to cover only expenditures expressly &#x93;advocating the election or defeat of a candidate&#x94;&#x97;using the so-called &#x93;magic words&#x94; of express advocacy.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court then proceeded to strike down the newly narrowed statute under strict scrutiny on the ground that its reach was not broad enough.  Id., at 44.  From this, Justice Scalia concludes that &#x93;[i]f a permissible test short of the magic-words test existed, Buckley would surely have adopted it.&#x94;  Post, at 14.  We are not so sure.  The question in Buckley was how a particular statutory provision could be construed to avoid vagueness concerns, not what the constitutional standard for clarity was in the abstract, divorced from specific statutory language.  Buckley&#x92;s intermediate step of statutory construction on the way to its constitutional holding does not dictate a constitutional test.  The Buckley Court&#x92;s &#x93;express advocacy restriction was an endpoint of statutory interpretation, not a first principle of constitutional law.&#x94;  McConnell, 540 U. S., at 190.  And despite Justice Scalia&#x92;s claim to the contrary, our citation of Buckley along with other decisions in rejecting an intent-and-effect test does not force us to adopt (or reject) Buckley&#x92;s statutory construction as a constitutional test.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-8" href="#ZO-8ref">8</a> Nothing in McConnell&#x92;s statement that the &#x93;vast majority&#x94; of issue ads broadcast in the periods preceding federal elections had an &#x93;electioneering purpose&#x94; forecloses this conclusion.  540 U. S., at 206.  Courts do not resolve unspecified as-applied challenges in the course of resolving a facial attack, so McConnell could not have settled the issue we address today.  See Members of City Council of Los Angeles v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/789" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 789</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">803</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">22</a> (1984)
 (&#x93;The fact that [a law] is capable of valid applications does not necessarily mean that it is valid as applied to these litigants&#x94;).  Indeed, WRTL I confirmed as much.  546 U. S., at 411&#x96;412.  By the same token, in deciding this as-applied challenge, we have no occasion to revisit McConnell&#x92;s conclusion that the statute is not facially overbroad.


The &#x93;vast majority&#x94; language, moreover, is beside the point.  The McConnell Court did not find that a &#x93;vast majority&#x94; of the issue ads considered were the functional equivalent of direct advocacy.  Rather, it found that such ads had an &#x93;electioneering purpose.&#x94;  For the reasons we have explained, &#x93;purpose&#x94; is not the appropriate test for distinguishing between genuine issue ads and the functional equivalent of express campaign advocacy.  See supra, at 14&#x96;15.  In addition, the &#x93;vast majority&#x94; statement was not necessary to the Court&#x92;s facial holding in McConnell.  The standard required for a statute to survive an overbreadth challenge is not that the &#x93;vast majority&#x94; of a statute&#x92;s applications be legitimate.  &#x93;[B]road language . . . unnecessary to the Court&#x92;s decision &#x2026; cannot be considered binding authority.&#x94;  Kastigar v.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-9" href="#ZO-9ref">9</a> The dissent stresses a number of points that, while not central to our decision, nevertheless merit a response.  First, the dissent overstates its case when it asserts that the &#x93;PAC alternative&#x94; gives corporations a constitutionally sufficient outlet to speak.  See post, at 30.  PACs impose well-documented and onerous burdens, particularly on small nonprofits.  See MCFL, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/479/238" class="subref" title="subref">479 U. S. 238</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">253</a>&#x96;255 (1986)
 (plurality opinion).  McConnell did conclude that segregated funds &#x93;provid[e] corporations and unions with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy&#x94; and its functional equivalent, 540 U. S., at 203, but that holding did not extend beyond functional equivalents&#x97;and if it did, the PAC option would justify regulation of all corporate speech, a proposition we have rejected, see Bellotti, 435 U. S., at 777&#x96;778.  Second, the response that a speaker should just take out a newspaper ad, or use a website, rather than complain that it cannot speak through a broadcast communication, see post, at 18&#x96;19, 33, is too glib.  Even assuming for the sake of argument that the possibility of using a different medium of communication has relevance in determining the permissibility of a limitation on speech, newspaper ads and websites are not reasonable alternatives to broadcast speech in terms of impact and effectiveness.  See McConnell v. FEC, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 569&#x96;573, 646 (Kollar-Kotelly, J.).  Third, we disagree with the dissent&#x92;s view that corporations can still speak by changing what they say to avoid mentioning candidates, post, at 30&#x96;31.  That argument is akin to telling Cohen that he cannot wear his jacket because he is free to wear one that says &#x93;I disagree with the draft,&#x94; cf. Cohen v. California, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/15" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 15</a> (1971)
, or telling 44 Liquormart that it can advertise so long as it avoids mentioning prices, cf. 44 Liquormart, Inc. v. Rhode Island, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/484" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 484</a> (1996)
.  Such notions run afoul of &#x93;the fundamental rule of protection under the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>, that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own message.&#x94;  Hurley v. Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.,

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-10" href="#ZO-10ref">10</a> The interest recognized in Austin stems from a concern that &#x93; &#x91;[t]he resources in the treasury of a business corporation . . . are not an indication of popular support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x92; &#x94;  Austin v.

 (alteration in original).  Some of WRTL&#x92;s amici contend that this interest is not implicated here because of WRTL&#x92;s status as a nonprofit advocacy organization.  They assert that &#x93;[s]peech by nonprofit advocacy groups on behalf of their members does not &#x91;corrupt&#x92; candidates or &#x91;distort&#x92; the political marketplace,&#x94; and that &#x93;[n]onprofit advocacy groups funded by individuals are readily distinguished from for-profit corporations funded by general treasuries.&#x94;  Brief for Family Research Council et al. as Amici Curiae 3, 4.  Cf. MCFL, 479 U. S., at 264.  We do not pass on this argument in this as-applied challenge because WRTL&#x92;s funds for its ads were not derived solely from individual contributions.

        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensable ingredient of a political candidacy is money for advertising.  In the 2004 campaign, more than half of the combined expenditures by the two principal presidential candidates (excluding fundraising) went for media time and space.  See The Costliest Campaign, Washington Post, Dec. 30, 2004, p. A7.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>2</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And in the 2005&#x96;2006 election cycle, the expenditure of more than $2 billion on television shattered the previous record, even without a presidential contest.  See Inside Media, MediaWeek, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 18.  The portent is for still greater spending.  By the end of March 2007, almost a year before the first primary and more than 18 months before the general election, presidential candidates had already raised over $150 million.  See Balz, Fundraising Totals Challenge Early Campaign Assumptions, Washington Post, Apr. 17, 2007, p. A1 (citing figures and noting that &#x93;[t]he campaign is living up to its reputation as the most expensive in U. S. history&#x94;).  To reach this total, the leading fundraisers collected over $250,000 per day in the first quarter of 2007, Mullins, Clinton Leads the Money Race, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2007, p. A8, and the eventual nominees are expected to raise $500 million apiece (about $680,000 per day over a 2-year election cycle), Kirkpatrick and Pilhofer, McCain Lags in Income But Excels in Spending, Report Shows, N. Y. Times, Apr. 15, 2007, p. 20.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensability of these huge sums has two significant consequences for American Government that are particularly on point here.  The enormous demands, first, assign power to deep pockets.  See Balz, <em>supra</em>, at A6 (&#x93;For all the interest in Internet fundraising, big donors still ruled in the first quarter, with roughly 80 percent of donations coming in amounts of $1,000 or more&#x94;).  Candidates occasionally boast about the number of contributors they have, but the headlines speaking in dollars reflect political reality.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Mullins, <em>supra</em>, at A8 (headlined &#x93;Clinton Leads the Money Race&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Some major contributors get satisfaction from pitching in for their candidates, but political preference fails to account for the frequency of giving &#x93;substantial sums to <em>both</em> major national parties,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 148, a practice driven &#x93;by stark political pragmatism, not by ideological support for either party or their candidates,&#x94; Brief for Committee for Economic Development et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> in <em>McConnell</em>, O. T. 2003, No. 02&#x96;1674, p. 3 (hereinafter CED Brief).  What the high-dollar pragmatists of either variety get is special access to the officials they help elect, and with it a disproportionate influence on those in power.  See <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em/>at 130&#x96;131.  As the erstwhile officer of a large American corporation put it, &#x93; &#x91;[b]usiness leaders believe&#x97;based on experience and with good reason&#x97;that &#x2026; access gives them an opportunity to shape and affect governmental decisions and that their ability to do so derives from the fact that they have given large sums of money to the parties.&#x92; &#x94;  CED Brief 9.  At a critical level, contributions that underwrite elections are leverage for enormous political influence.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Voters know this.  Hence, the second important consequence of the demand for big money to finance publicity: pervasive public cynicism.  A 2002 poll found that 71 percent of Americans think Members of Congress cast votes based on the views of their big contributors, even when those views differ from the Member&#x92;s own beliefs about what is best for the country.  Mellman &amp; Wirthlin 267; see also <em>id.</em>, at 266 (&#x93;In public opinion research it is uncommon to have 70 percent or more of the public see an issue the same way.  When they do, it indicates an unusually strong agreement on that issue&#x94;).  The same percentage believes that the will of contributors tempts Members to vote against the majority view of their constituents.  <em>Id.</em>, at 267.  Almost half of Americans believe that Members often decide how to vote based on what big contributors to their party want, while only a quarter think Members often base their votes on perceptions of what is best for the country or their constituents.

        <p class="bodytext">    At the same time, Congress had another worry that foreshadows our case today.  It was concerned that the statutory prohibition on corporate &#x93;contribution[s]&#x94; was being so narrowly construed as to open a &#x93;loophole whereby corporations, national banks, and labor organizations are enabled to avoid the obviously intended restrictive policy of the statute by garbing their financial assistance in the form of an &#x91;expenditure&#x92; rather than a contribution.&#x94;  S. Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38&#x96;39 (1947); see also H. Rep.

Of what avail would a law be to prohibit the contributing direct to a candidate and yet permit the expenditure of large sums in his behalf?&#x94;).

        <p class="bodytext">    In 1986, in <em>MCFL</em>, we reexamined the longstanding ban on spending corporate and union treasury funds &#x93;in connection with&#x94; federal elections, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/441b.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;441b</a>, and drew two conclusions implicated in the present case.  First, we construed the &#x93;in connection with&#x94; phrase in much the same way we had interpreted comparable FECA language challenged in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)

        <p class="bodytext">    We thus held that the prohibition applied &#x93;only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 44.  &#x93;[E]xpress terms,&#x94; in turn, meant what had already become known as &#x93;magic words,&#x94; such as &#x93; &#x91;vote for,&#x92; &#x91;elect,&#x92; &#x91;support,&#x92; &#x91;cast your ballot for,&#x92; &#x91;Smith for Congress,&#x92; &#x91;vote against,&#x92; &#x91;defeat,&#x92; &#x91;reject.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>,<em/>n. 52.  The consequence of this construction was obvious: it pulled the teeth out of the statute, as we had understood when we announced it in its earlier application in Buckley:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness &#x2026; undermines the limitation&#x92;s effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or officeholder.  It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate&#x92;s campaign.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 45.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nor was the statute, even as thus narrowed, enforceable against the particular advocacy corporation challenging the limit in <em>MCFL</em>.  This was the second holding of <em>MCFL </em>relevant here;<em/>we explained that the congressional effort to limit the political influence of corporate money &#x93;has reflected concern not about use of the corporate form <em>per se</em>, but about the potential for unfair deployment of wealth for political purposes,&#x94; 479 U.

We held that this &#x93;legitima[te]&#x94; concern could not reasonably extend to electioneering expenditures by the corporation at issue in <em>MCFL</em>, which neither &#x93;engage[d] in business activities&#x94; nor accepted donations from business corporations and unions (and thus could not serve as a &#x93;condui[t]&#x94; for political spending by those entities).  <em>Id.</em>, at 263&#x96;264.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

Experience showed, however, just what we foresaw in <em>Buckley</em>, that the line between &#x93;issue&#x94; broadcasts and outright electioneering was a patent fiction, as in the example of a television &#x93;issue ad&#x94; that ran during a Montana congressional race between Republican Rick Hill and Democrat Bill Yellowtail in 1996:</p>

We rejected any suggestion &#x93;that <em>Buckley</em> drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy [with magic words] and so-called issue advocacy [without them], and that speakers possess an inviolable 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to engage in the latter category of speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 190.  To the contrary, we held that &#x93;our decisions in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em> were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 192&#x96;193.  &#x93;[T]he presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech,&#x94; which is prohibitable, &#x93;from a true issue ad,&#x94; we said, since ads that &#x93;esche[w] the use of magic words &#x2026; are no less clearly intended to influence the election.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 193.  We thus found &#x93;[l]ittle difference &#x2026; between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We understood that Congress had a compelling interest in limiting this sort of electioneering by corporations and unions, for &#xA7;203 exemplified a tradition of &#x93;repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660).  Nor did we see any plausible claim of substantial overbreadth from incidentally prohibiting ads genuinely focused on issues rather than elections, given the limitation of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; by time, geographical coverage, and clear reference to candidate.  &#x93;Far from establishing that BCRA&#x92;s application to pure issue ads is substantial, either in an absolute sense or relative to its application to election-related advertising, the record strongly supports the contrary conclusion.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 207.  Finally, we underscored the reasonableness of the &#xA7;203 line by emphasizing that it defined a category of limited, but not prohibited, corporate and union speech: &#x93;Because corporations can still fund electioneering communications with PAC money, it is &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression rather than a regulation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 204 (quoting <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em> v. <em>Beaumont</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    We may add that a nonprofit corporation, no matter what its source of funding, is free to pelt a federal candidate like Jane Doe with criticism or shower her with praise, by name and within days of an election, if it speaks through a newspaper ad or on a website, rather than a &#x93;broadcast, cable, or satellite communication,&#x94;

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, Congress in 1907 prohibited corporate contributions to candidates and in 1943 applied the same ban to unions.  In 1947, Congress extended the complete ban from contributions to expenditures &#x93;in connection with&#x94; an election, a phrase so vague that in 1986 we held it must be confined to instances of express advocacy using magic words.  Congress determined, in 2002, that corporate and union expenditures for fake issue ads devoid of magic words should be regulated using a narrow definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; to reach only broadcast ads that were the practical equivalents of express advocacy.  In 2003, this Court found the provision free from vagueness and justified by the concern that drove its enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This century-long tradition of legislation and judicial precedent rests on facing undeniable facts and testifies to an equally undeniable value.  Campaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries, with no redolence of &#x93;grassroots&#x94; about them.  Neither Congress&#x92;s decisions nor our own have understood the corrupting influence of money in politics as being limited to outright bribery or discrete <em>quid pro quo; </em>campaign finance reform has instead consistently focused on the more pervasive distortion of electoral institutions by concentrated wealth, on the special access and guaranteed favor that sap the representative integrity of American government and defy public confidence in its institutions.  From early in the 20th century through the decision in <em>McConnell</em>, we have acknowledged that the value of democratic integrity justifies a realistic response when corporations and labor organizations commit the concentrated moneys in their treasuries to electioneering.</p>

            </a>  In 2004, WRTL accepted over $315,000 in corporate donations, App. 40, and of its six general fund contributions of $50,000 or more between 2002 and 2005, three, including the largest (for $140,000), came from corporate donors, <em>id.</em>, at 118&#x96;121.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL also runs a PAC, funded by individual donations, which has been active over the years in making independent campaign expenditures, as in the previous two elections involving Senator Feingold.  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  During the 1998 campaign, for example, WRTL&#x92;s PAC spent $60,000 to oppose him.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In 2004, however, despite a sharp nationwide increase in PAC receipts, WRTL focused its fundraising on its corporate treasury, not the PAC, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;43, and took in only $17,000 in PAC contributions, as against over $150,000 during 2000, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;42.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Throughout the 2004 senatorial campaign, WRTL made no secret of its views about who should win the election and explicitly tied its position to the filibuster issue.  Its PAC issued at least two press releases saying that its &#x93;Top Election Priorities&#x94; were to &#x93;Re-elect George W. Bush&#x94; and &#x93;Send Feingold Packing!&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 78&#x96;80, 82&#x96;84.  In one of these, the Chair of WRTL&#x92;s PAC was quoted as saying, &#x93; &#x91;We do not want Russ Feingold to continue to have the ability to thwart President Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 82&#x96;83.  The Spring 2004 issue of the WRTL PAC&#x92;s quarterly magazine ran an article headlined &#x93;Radically Pro-Abortion Feingold Must Go!&#x94;, which reported that &#x93;Feingold has been active in his opposition to Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees&#x94; and said that &#x93;the defeat of Feingold must be uppermost in the minds of Wisconsin&#x92;s pro-life community in the 2004 elections.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 101&#x96;103.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    It was under these circumstances that WRTL ran the three television and radio ads in question.  The bills for them were not paid by WRTL&#x92;s PAC, but out of the general treasury with its substantial proportion of corporate contributions; in fact, corporations earmarked more than $50,000 specifically to pay for the ads, <em>id.</em>, at 41.  Each one criticized an unnamed &#x93;group of Senators&#x94; for &#x93;using the filibuster delay tactic to block federal judicial nominees from a simple &#x91;yes&#x92; or &#x91;no&#x92; vote,&#x94; and described the Senators&#x92; actions as &#x93;politics at work, causing gridlock and backing up some of our courts to a state of emergency.&#x94;<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>  They exhorted viewers and listeners to &#x93;[c]ontact Senators Feingold and Kohl and tell them to oppose the filibuster,&#x94; but instead of providing a phone number or e-mail address, they told the audience to go to BeFair.org, a website set up by WRTL.  A visit to this website would erase any doubt a listener or viewer might have as to whether Senators Feingold and Kohl were part of the &#x93;group&#x94; condemned in the ads: it displayed a document that criticized the two Senators for voting to filibuster &#x93;16 out of 16 times&#x94; and accused them of &#x93;putting politics into the court system, creating gridlock, and costing taxpayers money.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 86.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL&#x92;s planned airing of the ads had no apparent relation to any Senate filibuster vote but was keyed to the timing of the senatorial election.  WRTL began broadcasting the ads on July 26, 2004, four days after the Senate recessed for the summer, and although the filibuster controversy raged on through 2005, WRTL did not resume running the ads after the election.  <em>Id.</em>, at 29, 32.  During the campaign period that the ads did cover, Senator Feingold&#x92;s support of the filibusters was a prominent issue.  His position was well known,<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, any Wisconsin voter who paid attention would have known that Democratic Senator Feingold supported filibusters against Republican presidential judicial nominees, that the propriety of the filibusters was a major issue in the senatorial campaign, and that WRTL along with the Senator&#x92;s Republican challengers opposed his reelection because of his position on filibusters.  Any alert voters who heard or saw WRTL&#x92;s ads would have understood that WRTL was telling them that the Senator&#x92;s position on the filibusters should be grounds to vote against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given these facts, it is beyond all reasonable debate that the ads are constitutionally subject to regulation under <em>McConnell</em>.  There, we noted that BCRA was meant to remedy the problem of &#x93;[s]o-called issue ads&#x94; being used &#x93;to advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 126.  We then gave a paradigmatic example of these electioneering ads subject to regulation, saying that &#x93;[l]ittle difference existed . . . between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The WRTL ads were indistinguishable from the Jane Doe ad; they &#x93;condemned [Senator Feingold&#x92;s] record on a particular issue&#x94; and exhorted the public to contact him and &#x93;tell [him] what you think.&#x94;<a name="ZD-16ref" href="#ZD-16" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>16</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And just as anyone who heard the Jane Doe ad would understand that the point was to defeat Doe, anyone who heard the Feingold ads (let alone anyone who went to the website they named) would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.  If it is now unconstitutional to restrict WRTL&#x92;s Feingold ads, then it follows that &#xA7;203 can no longer be applied constitutionally to <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>Jane Doe paradigm.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding that &#xA7;203 is facially constitutional is overruled.  By what steps does the principal opinion reach this unacknowledged result less than four years after <em>McConnell</em> was decided?</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, it lays down a new test to identify a severely limited class of ads that may constitutionally be regulated as electioneering communications, a test that is flatly contrary to <em>McConnell</em>.  An ad is the equivalent of express advocacy and subject to regulation, the opinion says, only if it is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Since the Feingold ads could, in isolation, be read as at least including calls to communicate views on filibusters to the two Senators, those ads cannot be treated as the functional equivalent of express advocacy to elect or defeat anyone, and therefore may not constitutionally be regulated at all.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the same could have been said of the hypothetical Jane Doe ad.  Its spoken message ended with the instruction to tell Doe what the voter thinks.  The same could also have been said of the actual Yellowtail ad.  Yet in <em>McConnell</em>, we gave the Jane Doe ad as the paradigm of a broadcast message that could be constitutionally regulated as election conduct, and we explicitly described the Yellowtail ad as a &#x93;striking example&#x94; of one that was &#x93;clearly intended to influence the election,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 193, and n. 78.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The principal opinion, in other words, simply inverts what we said in <em>McConnell</em>.  While we left open the possibility of a &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure&#x94; issue ad that might not be open to regulation under &#xA7;203, <em>id.</em>, at 206&#x96;207, and n. 88, we meant that an issue ad without campaign advocacy could escape the restriction.  The implication of the adjectives &#x93;genuine&#x94; and &#x93;pure&#x94; is unmistakable: if an ad is reasonably understood as going beyond a discussion of issues (that is, if it can be understood as electoral advocacy), then by definition it is not &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure.&#x94;  But the principal opinion inexplicably wrings the opposite conclusion from those words: if an ad is susceptible to any &#x93;reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; then it must be a &#x93;pure&#x94; or &#x93;genuine&#x94; issue ad.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  This stands <em>McConnell</em> on its head, and on this reasoning it is pos-<span class="softbreak"/>sible that even some ads with magic words could not be regulated.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Second, the principal opinion seems to defend this inversion of <em>McConnell</em> as a necessary alternative to an unadministrable subjective test for the equivalence of express (and regulable) electioneering advocacy.  The principal opinion acknowledges, of course, that in <em>McConnell</em> we said that &#x93;[t]he justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during [the period shortly before an election] if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;  540 U.

But <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> says that statement in <em>McConnell</em> cannot be accepted at face value because we could not, consistent with precedent, have focused our

But <em>McConnell</em> did not do that.  It did not purport to draw constitutional lines based on the subjective motivations of corporations (or their principals) sponsoring political ads, but merely described our test for equivalence to express advocacy as resting on the ads&#x92; &#x93;electioneering purpose,&#x94; which will be objectively apparent from those ads&#x92; content and context (as these cases and the examples cited in <em>McConnell </em>readily show).  We therefore held that &#xA7;203 was not substantially overbroad because &#x93;the vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose,&#x94; and consequently could be regulated consistent with the

        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, if the studies to which <span class="smallcaps">The</span>

The authors of those studies did not conduct discovery of the &#x93;actua[l] inten[tions],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14, behind any ads; nor, to my knowledge, were the sponsors of campaign ads summoned before researchers to explain their motivations.  The studies merely confirmed that &#x93;reasonable people are &#x2026; able to discern between ads whose primary purpose is to support a candidate and those intended to provide information about a policy issue.&#x94;  J.

To be clear, I am not endorsing the precise methodology of those studies (and <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> is correct that we did not do so in <em>McConnell</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13, n. 4); the point is only that the studies relied on a &#x93;reasonable&#x94; person&#x92;s understanding of the ads&#x92; apparent purpose, and thus were no less objective than <span class="smallcaps">The</span>

A reasonable Wisconsinite watching or listening to WRTL&#x92;s ads would likely ask and answer some obvious questions about their circumstances.  Is the group that sponsors these ads the same one publicly campaigning against Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection?  <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> says that this information is &#x93;beside the point,&#x94; because WRTL&#x92;s history of overt electioneering only &#x93;goes to [its] subjective intent.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Did these &#x93;issue&#x94; ads begin appearing on the air during the election season, rather than at the time the filibuster &#x93;issue&#x94; was in fact being debated in the Senate?  This, too, is said to be irrelevant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  And does the website to which WRTL&#x92;s ads direct viewers contain material expressly advocating Senator Feingold&#x92;s defeat?  This enquiry is dismissed as being &#x93;one step removed from the text of the ads themselves.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  But these questions are central to the meaning of the ads, and any reasonable person would take account of circumstances in coming to understand the object of WRTL&#x92;s ad.  And why not?  Each of the contextual facts here can be established by an objective look at a public record; none requires a voter (or a litigant) to engage in discovery of evidence about WRTL&#x92;s operations or internal communications, and none goes to a hidden state of mind.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This refusal to see and hear what any listener to WRTL&#x92;s ads would actually consider produces a rule no different in practice from the one adopted by the District Court, which declined to look beyond the &#x93;four corners&#x94; of the ads themselves.  466 F.

S., at 201&#x96;202), and WRTL has a particularly weak position on this point: it set up its own PAC long before the 2004 election, used it to campaign openly against Senator Feingold in the past, and could have raised noncorporate donations to it in the 2004 election cycle.  Any argument that establishing and maintaining a PAC is unconstitutionally burdensome for WRTL would thus likely be futile, and certainly should not prevail on WRTL&#x92;s summary judgment motion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, even without the PAC alternative, it would be untrue that &#xA7;203 &#x93;banned&#x94; WRTL from saying anything a genuine issue ad would say, for WRTL could have availed itself of either or both of the following additional options.  It is undisputed that WRTL&#x92;s ads could have been broadcast lawfully in the runup to the election (and bankrolled from WRTL&#x92;s general treasury) if Senator Feingold&#x92;s name had been omitted and the Senator not otherwise singled out.  Since members of today&#x92;s majority apparently view WRTL&#x92;s broadcasts either as &#x93;genuine issue ad[s],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16 (opinion of <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>), or as &#x93;lobby[ing] Wisconsin voters concerning the filibustering of the President&#x92;s judicial nominees,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 2 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.,</span> concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a claim that omitting Senator Feingold&#x92;s name would &#x93;ban&#x94; WRTL&#x92;s message is specious.  Yet one searches my Brothers&#x92; opinions in vain for any persuasive reason why substituting the phrase &#x93;Contact your Senators&#x94; for the phrase &#x93;Contact Senators Feingold and Kohl&#x94; would have denied WRTL a constitutionally sufficient (and clearly lawful) alternative way to send its message.  If WRTL is to be believed when it claims that the issue was the point of the ads, it would have lost nothing by referring simply to the &#x93;Senators.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the suggestion that &#xA7;203 is a ban on political speech is belied by <em>MCFL</em>&#x92;s safe harbor for nonprofit advocacy corporations: under that rule, WRTL would have been free to attack Senator Feingold by name at any time with ads funded from its corporate treasury, if it had not also chosen to serve as a funnel for hundreds of thousands of dollars from other corporations.  Thus, what is called a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech is a limit on the financing of electioneering broadcasts by entities that refuse to take advantage of the PAC structure but insist on acting as conduits from the campaign war chests of business corporations.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, <em>McConnell</em> does not graft a subjective standard onto campaign regulation, the context of campaign advertising cannot sensibly be ignored, and &#xA7;203 is not a ban on speech.  What cannot be gainsaid, in any event, is that in treating these subjects as it does, the operative opinion produces the result of overruling <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding on &#xA7;203, less than four years in the Reports.  Anyone who doubts that need merely ask what the law would have been if, back in 2003, this Court had held &#xA7;203 facially unconstitutional.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    BCRA&#x92;s definition of &#x93;electioneering communication,&#x94; which identifies the communications regulable under &#xA7;203, includes a backup to be used if the primary definition &#x93;is held to be constitutionally insufficient by final judicial decision to support the regulation provided herein.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_A_ii" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(A)(ii)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If this should occur, &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; is to be defined as </p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This backup sounds familiar because it is essentially identical to <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s test for evaluating an as-applied challenge to the original definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94;: regulation is permissible only if the communication is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16.  Thus does the principal opinion institute the very standard that would have prevailed if the Court formally overruled <em>McConnell</em>.  There is neither a theoretical nor a practical basis to claim that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s treatment of &#xA7;203 survives.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">E</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The price of <em>McConnell&#x92;</em>s<em/>demise as authority on &#xA7;203 seems to me to be a high one.  The Court (and, I think, the country) loses when important precedent is overruled without good reason, and there is no justification for departing from our usual rule of <em>stare decisis</em> here.  The same combination of alternatives that was available to corporations affected by <em>McConnell</em> in 2003 is available today: WRTL could have run a newspaper ad, could have paid for the broadcast ads through its PAC, could have established itself as an <em>MCFL</em> organization free of corporate money, and could have said &#x93;call your Senators&#x94; instead of naming Senator Feingold in its ads broadcasted just before the election.  Nothing in the related law surrounding &#xA7;203 has changed in any way, let alone in any way that undermines <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>rationale.  See <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>,

.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nor can any serious argument be made that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding has been &#x93;unworkable in practice.&#x94;  <em>Allied-Signal, Inc.</em> v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation</em>,

            </a>  Although WRTL contends that the as-applied remedy has proven to be &#x93;[i]nadequate&#x94; because such challenges cannot be litigated quickly enough to avoid being mooted, Brief for Appellee 65&#x96;66, nothing prevents an advertiser from obtaining a preliminary injunction if it can qualify for one, and WRTL does not point to any evidence that district courts have been unable to rule on any such matters in a timely way.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, it goes without saying that nothing has changed about the facts.  In Justice Frankfurter&#x92;s words, they demonstrate a threat to &#x93;the integrity of our electoral process,&#x94; <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 570, which for a century now Congress has repeatedly found to be imperiled by corporate, and later union, money: witness the Tillman Act, Taft-Hartley, FECA, and BCRA.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  <em>McConnell </em>was our latest decision vindicating clear and reasonable boundaries that Congress has drawn to limit &#x93; &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth,&#x92; &#x94; 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660), and the decision could claim the justification of ongoing fact as well as decisional history in recognizing Congress&#x92;s authority to protect the integrity of elections from the distortion of corporate and union funds.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After today, the ban on contributions by corporations and unions and the limitation on their corrosive spending when they enter the political arena are open to easy circumvention, and the possibilities for regulating corporate and union campaign money are unclear.  The ban on contributions will mean nothing much, now that companies and unions can save candidates the expense of advertising directly, simply by running &#x93;issue ads&#x94; without express advocacy, or by funneling the money through an independent corporation like WRTL.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the understanding of the voters and the Congress that this kind of corporate and union spending seriously jeopardizes the integrity of democratic government will remain.  The facts are too powerful to be ignored, and further efforts at campaign finance reform will come.  It is only the legal landscape that now is altered, and it may be that today&#x92;s departure from precedent will drive further reexamination of the constitutional analysis: of the distinction between contributions and expenditures, or the relation between spending and speech, which have given structure to our thinking since <em>Buckley</em> itself was decided.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    I cannot tell what the future will force upon us, but I respectfully dissent from this judgment today.</p>

Justice Scalia asserts that Austin &#x93;strayed far from&#x94; the principles we announced in First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/435/765" class="subref" title="subref">435 U. S. 765</a> (1978)
.  Ante, at 7 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Bellotti, however, concerned corporate spending in connection with a referendum, and we went out of our way in that case to avoid casting any doubt upon the constitutionality of limiting corporate expenditures during candidate elections.  We said:


&#x93;The overriding concern behind the enactment of [the federal restrictions on corporate contributions and expenditures] was the problem of corruption of elected representatives through the creation of political debts.  The importance of the governmental interest in preventing this occurrence has never been doubted.  The case before us presents no comparable problem, and our consideration of a corporation&#x92;s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.  Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.&#x94;  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26 (citations omitted).


Eight years before Austin, we unanimously reaffirmed that Bellotti &#x93;specifically pointed out that in elections of candidates to public office, unlike in referenda on issues of general public interest, there may well be a threat of real or apparent corruption.&#x94;  Federal Election Comm&#x92;n v.

Then, four years later, in MCFL, we also noted that an expenditure limit offering corporations a PAC alternative is &#x93;distinguishable from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for political speech&#x94; that we addressed in Bellotti.  479 U. S., at 259, n. 12.  So Austin did not &#x93;stra[y]&#x94; from Bellotti, ante, at 7 (opinion of Scalia, J.); the reasons Bellotti was not controlling in Austin had been clearly foreshadowed in Bellotti itself and confirmed repeatedly in our decisions leading up to Austin.

&#x93;Especially beginning in 1996, issue advocacy during the campaign season dramatically expanded in Wisconsin.
.....


&#x93;The Commission concludes that, in each of these cases, the expenditures were clearly campaign-oriented activities.  They were quite clearly designed to influence the electoral process.  They were focused either on electing or defeating a candidate.  The Commission bases this conclusion on the following points:


&#x93;Although those paying for the activities claimed they were aimed solely at educating voters on the issues, they each mentioned the names of candidates for office.


&#x93;They occurred only when election races were in progress that involved a contest between an incumbent and a challenger.  When the election was over, the activities ended.


&#x93;The activity has occurred after legislative sessions when the issues about which advocacy was occurring were not being deliberated by the legislature.


&#x93;The activity occurred in campaign season, between the candidate&#x92;s filing for candidacy and election time.  Advertisements of this sort have tended to occur at virtually no other time.


&#x93;The activity involved the electronic media, mass mailings, or centrally located telephone banks.
.....


&#x93;The explosive growth of campaign-based advocacy, without even disclosure of its activities and funding sources, poses a grave risk to the integrity of elections. It has created a two-tiered campaign process: one, based in candidates and political parties, which is tightly regulated and controlled; the other, based in interest group activity under the guise of &#x91;issue advocacy&#x92; but actually quite clearly election-focused, which lies beyond accountability.&#x94;  1 Governor&#x92;s Blue-Ribbon Commission on Campaign Finance Reform, State of Wisconsin: Report of the Commission, available at http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm.

But one need not look far in our McConnell opinion to understand why we thought that corporations have more than the constrained set of options available to the union leader in Thomas.  Just a few sentences after holding that ads with electioneering intent and effect are regulable, we gave this explanation: &#x93;in the future corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads [shortly before an election] by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.  In other words, corporations can find refuge in constitutionally sufficient and clearly delineated safe harbors by modifying the content of their ads (by omitting a candidate&#x92;s name) or by altering the sources of their ads&#x92; financing (from general treasuries to PACs).  The Chief Justice thus wrongly jettisons our conclusions about the constitutionality of regulating ads with electioneering purpose; we meant what we said in McConnell, and we did not overlook 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence when we said it.  Whereas The Chief Justice says that BCRA &#x93;should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights,&#x94; ante, at 14, we already held in McConnell that the campaign finance law accomplishes precisely that.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-18" href="#ZD-18ref">18</a> The Chief Justice speculates that McConnell derived its test for functional equivalence from &#x93;[t]wo key studies,&#x94; ante, at 12, but not a shred of language in McConnell supports that theory.  In stating the legal standard, McConnell made no mention of any study.  What is the authority, then, for asserting that the studies were pivotal to the standard we announced in McConnell?  See ante, at 12.  Other than WRTL&#x92;s brief, The Chief Justice cites only Judge Henderson&#x92;s separate district court opinion in McConnell.  Ante, at 12.  But The Chief Justice quotes one part of Judge Henderson&#x92;s analysis and neglects to mention that she in turn was quoting the lead author of one of the studies in question: &#x93;According to the Brennan Center, the Buying Time reports were &#x91;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of&#x92; BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions &#x91;in support of their constitutional validity.&#x92; &#x94;  McConnell, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 307&#x96;308 (opinion of Henderson, J.) (italics in original) (quoting deposition of Craig P. Holman, principal co-author of Buying Time 2000: Television Advertising in the 2000 Federal Elections (Brennan Center 2001)).

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-19" href="#ZD-19ref">19</a> Like the District Court, the only bit of context The Chief Justice would allow the reasonable listener is the congressional agenda: whether the &#x93; &#x91;issue&#x92; &#x94; addressed in an ad currently is, or soon will be, &#x93; &#x91;the subject of legislative scrutiny.&#x92; &#x94;  Ante, at 20 (quoting 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 207).  For example, The Chief Justice says, there would have been &#x93;no reason&#x94; to think that WRTL&#x92;s ad constituted anything but a pure issue ad if it addressed a bill pending during Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection campaign, such as the Universal National Service Act.  Ante, at 17.  It is revealing, of course, that The Chief Justice does not invoke the filibuster issue, the subject of WRTL&#x92;s ads, as the legislative matter with particular salience during the 2004 election.  But why the reasonable listener can look to Congress but not the calendar on the wall or a WRTL website is difficult to fathom.

See ante, at 18 (&#x93;Section 203&#x92;s line is bright, but it bans vast amounts of political advocacy indistinguishable from hitherto protected speech&#x94;).

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-21" href="#ZD-21ref">21</a> These as-applied challenges provide no reason to second-guess our conclusion in McConnell that the rule for differentiating between electioneering ads and genuine issue ads is administrable.  WRTL&#x92;s ads clearly have an electioneering purpose and, as explained above, fall comfortably within the heartland of electioneering communications that &#xA7;203 may validly regulate.  Thus, although Justice Scalia claims that &#x93;[t]oday&#x92;s cases make it apparent&#x94; that McConnell must be overruled, ante, at 18, there is nothing about today&#x92;s cases that suggests that McConnell is unworkable.  We therefore have no occasion to reconsider McConnell from first principles.

        <p class="bodytext">    The significance and effect of today&#x92;s judgment, from which I respectfully dissent, turn on three things: the demand for campaign money in huge amounts from large contributors, whose power has produced a cynical electorate; the congressional recognition of the ensuing threat to democratic integrity as reflected in a century of legislation restricting the electoral leverage of concentrations of money in corporate and union treasuries; and <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensable ingredient of a political candidacy is money for advertising.  In the 2004 campaign, more than half of the combined expenditures by the two principal presidential candidates (excluding fundraising) went for media time and space.  See The Costliest Campaign, Washington Post, Dec. 30, 2004, p. A7.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>2</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And in the 2005&#x96;2006 election cycle, the expenditure of more than $2 billion on television shattered the previous record, even without a presidential contest.  See Inside Media, MediaWeek, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 18.  The portent is for still greater spending.  By the end of March 2007, almost a year before the first primary and more than 18 months before the general election, presidential candidates had already raised over $150 million.  See Balz, Fundraising Totals Challenge Early Campaign Assumptions, Washington Post, Apr. 17, 2007, p. A1 (citing figures and noting that &#x93;[t]he campaign is living up to its reputation as the most expensive in U. S. history&#x94;).  To reach this total, the leading fundraisers collected over $250,000 per day in the first quarter of 2007, Mullins, Clinton Leads the Money Race, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2007, p. A8, and the eventual nominees are expected to raise $500 million apiece (about $680,000 per day over a 2-year election cycle), Kirkpatrick and Pilhofer, McCain Lags in Income But Excels in Spending, Report Shows, N. Y. Times, Apr. 15, 2007, p. 20.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensability of these huge sums has two significant consequences for American Government that are particularly on point here.  The enormous demands, first, assign power to deep pockets.  See Balz, <em>supra</em>, at A6 (&#x93;For all the interest in Internet fundraising, big donors still ruled in the first quarter, with roughly 80 percent of donations coming in amounts of $1,000 or more&#x94;).  Candidates occasionally boast about the number of contributors they have, but the headlines speaking in dollars reflect political reality.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Mullins, <em>supra</em>, at A8 (headlined &#x93;Clinton Leads the Money Race&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Some major contributors get satisfaction from pitching in for their candidates, but political preference fails to account for the frequency of giving &#x93;substantial sums to <em>both</em> major national parties,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 148, a practice driven &#x93;by stark political pragmatism, not by ideological support for either party or their candidates,&#x94; Brief for Committee for Economic Development et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> in <em>McConnell</em>, O. T. 2003, No. 02&#x96;1674, p. 3 (hereinafter CED Brief).  What the high-dollar pragmatists of either variety get is special access to the officials they help elect, and with it a disproportionate influence on those in power.  See <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em/>at 130&#x96;131.  As the erstwhile officer of a large American corporation put it, &#x93; &#x91;[b]usiness leaders believe&#x97;based on experience and with good reason&#x97;that &#x2026; access gives them an opportunity to shape and affect governmental decisions and that their ability to do so derives from the fact that they have given large sums of money to the parties.&#x92; &#x94;  CED Brief 9.  At a critical level, contributions that underwrite elections are leverage for enormous political influence.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Voters know this.  Hence, the second important consequence of the demand for big money to finance publicity: pervasive public cynicism.  A 2002 poll found that 71 percent of Americans think Members of Congress cast votes based on the views of their big contributors, even when those views differ from the Member&#x92;s own beliefs about what is best for the country.  Mellman &amp; Wirthlin 267; see also <em>id.</em>, at 266 (&#x93;In public opinion research it is uncommon to have 70 percent or more of the public see an issue the same way.  When they do, it indicates an unusually strong agreement on that issue&#x94;).  The same percentage believes that the will of contributors tempts Members to vote against the majority view of their constituents.  <em>Id.</em>, at 267.  Almost half of Americans believe that Members often decide how to vote based on what big contributors to their party want, while only a quarter think Members often base their votes on perceptions of what is best for the country or their constituents.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Devoting concentrations of money in self-interested hands to the support of political campaigning therefore threatens the capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents and the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves.  These are the elements summed up in the notion of political integrity, giving it a value second to none in a free society.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the threat to this value flowing from concentrations of money in politics has reached an unprecedented enormity, it has been gathering force for generations.  Before the turn of the last century, as now, it was obvious that the purchase of influence and the cynicism of voters threaten the integrity and stability of democratic government, each derived from the responsiveness of its law to the interests of citizens and their confidence in that focus.  The danger has traditionally seemed at its apex when no reasonable limits constrain the campaign activities of organizations whose &#x93;unique legal and economic characteristics&#x94; are tailored to &#x93;facilitat[e] the amassing of large treasuries,&#x94; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Thirty years later, new questions about the electoral influence of accumulated wealth surfaced as organized labor expanded during the New Deal.  In the 1936 election, labor unions contributed &#x93;unprecedented&#x94; sums, S. Rep. No. 151, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 127 (1937), the greater part of them by the United Mine Workers, see Campaign Finance Sourcebook 17.  And in due course reaction began to build: &#x93;[w]artime strikes gave rise to fears of the new concentration of power represented by the gains of trade unionism.  And so the belief grew that, just as the great corporations had made huge political contributions to influence governmental action &#x2026; , the powerful unions were pursuing a similar course, and with the same untoward consequences for the democratic process.&#x94;  <em>Automobile Workers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 578.  Congress responded with the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943, which extended the ban on corporate donations to labor organizations, ch. 144, &#xA7;9, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">57</a>Stat.
167&#x96;168, an extension that was made permanent in the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, better known as Taft-Hartley, &#xA7;304,

        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At the same time, Congress had another worry that foreshadows our case today.  It was concerned that the statutory prohibition on corporate &#x93;contribution[s]&#x94; was being so narrowly construed as to open a &#x93;loophole whereby corporations, national banks, and labor organizations are enabled to avoid the obviously intended restrictive policy of the statute by garbing their financial assistance in the form of an &#x91;expenditure&#x92; rather than a contribution.&#x94;  S. Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38&#x96;39 (1947); see also H. Rep. No. 2739, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 40 (1947) (&#x93;The intent and purpose of the provision of the act prohibiting any corporation or labor organization making any contribution in connection with any election would be wholly defeated if it were assumed that the term &#x91;making any contribution&#x92; related only to the donating of money directly to a candidate, and excluded the vast expenditures of money in the activities herein shown to be engaged in extensively.  Of what avail would a law be to prohibit the contributing direct to a candidate and yet permit the expenditure of large sums in his behalf?&#x94;).  Taft-Hartley therefore extended the prohibition to any &#x93;contribution or expenditure&#x94; by a corporation or a union &#x93;in connection with&#x94; a federal election.  &#xA7;304,

        <p class="bodytext">    The new law left open, however, the right of a union to spend money on electioneering from a segregated fund raised specifically for that purpose from members, but not drawn from the general treasury.  Segregated funding entities, the now-familiar political action committees or PACs, had been established prior to Taft-Hartley, and we concluded in <em>Pipefitters</em> v. <em>United States</em>,

First, we construed the &#x93;in connection with&#x94; phrase in much the same way we had interpreted comparable FECA language challenged in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)

        <p class="bodytext">    We thus held that the prohibition applied &#x93;only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U.

It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate&#x92;s campaign.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 45.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    An issue ad is an advertisement on a political subject urging the reader or listener to let a politician know what he thinks, but containing no magic words telling the recipient to vote for or against anyone.  By the 1996 election cycle, between $135 and $150 million was being devoted to these ads, see <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 127, n. 20, and because they had no magic words, they failed to trigger the limitation on union or corporate expenditures for electioneering.  Experience showed, however, just what we foresaw in <em>Buckley</em>, that the line between &#x93;issue&#x94; broadcasts and outright electioneering was a patent fiction, as in the example of a television &#x93;issue ad&#x94; that ran during a Montana congressional race between Republican Rick Hill and Democrat Bill Yellowtail in 1996:</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>McConnell</em>, we found this definition to be &#x93;easily understood and objectiv[e],&#x94; raising &#x93;none of the vagueness concerns that drove our analysis&#x94; of the statutory language at issue in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em>, 540 U.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  We rejected any suggestion &#x93;that <em>Buckley</em> drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy [with magic words] and so-called issue advocacy [without them], and that speakers possess an inviolable 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to engage in the latter category of speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 190.  To the contrary, we held that &#x93;our decisions in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em> were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 192&#x96;193.  &#x93;[T]he presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech,&#x94; which is prohibitable, &#x93;from a true issue ad,&#x94; we said, since ads that &#x93;esche[w] the use of magic words &#x2026; are no less clearly intended to influence the election.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 193.  We thus found &#x93;[l]ittle difference &#x2026; between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We understood that Congress had a compelling interest in limiting this sort of electioneering by corporations and unions, for &#xA7;203 exemplified a tradition of &#x93;repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U.

Nor did we see any plausible claim of substantial overbreadth from incidentally prohibiting ads genuinely focused on issues rather than elections, given the limitation of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; by time, geographical coverage, and clear reference to candidate.  &#x93;Far from establishing that BCRA&#x92;s application to pure issue ads is substantial, either in an absolute sense or relative to its application to election-related advertising, the record strongly supports the contrary conclusion.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 207.  Finally, we underscored the reasonableness of the &#xA7;203 line by emphasizing that it defined a category of limited, but not prohibited, corporate and union speech: &#x93;Because corporations can still fund electioneering communications with PAC money, it is &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression rather than a regulation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 204 (quoting <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em> v. <em>Beaumont</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    We may add that a nonprofit corporation, no matter what its source of funding, is free to pelt a federal candidate like Jane Doe with criticism or shower her with praise, by name and within days of an election, if it speaks through a newspaper ad or on a website, rather than a &#x93;broadcast, cable, or satellite communication,&#x94;

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, Congress in 1907 prohibited corporate contributions to candidates and in 1943 applied the same ban to unions.  In 1947, Congress extended the complete ban from contributions to expenditures &#x93;in connection with&#x94; an election, a phrase so vague that in 1986 we held it must be confined to instances of express advocacy using magic words.  Congress determined, in 2002, that corporate and union expenditures for fake issue ads devoid of magic words should be regulated using a narrow definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; to reach only broadcast ads that were the practical equivalents of express advocacy.  In 2003, this Court found the provision free from vagueness and justified by the concern that drove its enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This century-long tradition of legislation and judicial precedent rests on facing undeniable facts and testifies to an equally undeniable value.  Campaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries, with no redolence of &#x93;grassroots&#x94; about them.  Neither Congress&#x92;s decisions nor our own have understood the corrupting influence of money in politics as being limited to outright bribery or discrete <em>quid pro quo; </em>campaign finance reform has instead consistently focused on the more pervasive distortion of electoral institutions by concentrated wealth, on the special access and guaranteed favor that sap the representative integrity of American government and defy public confidence in its institutions.  From early in the 20th century through the decision in <em>McConnell</em>, we have acknowledged that the value of democratic integrity justifies a realistic response when corporations and labor organizations commit the concentrated moneys in their treasuries to electioneering.</p>

            </a>  In 2004, WRTL accepted over $315,000 in corporate donations, App. 40, and of its six general fund contributions of $50,000 or more between 2002 and 2005, three, including the largest (for $140,000), came from corporate donors, <em>id.</em>, at 118&#x96;121.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL also runs a PAC, funded by individual donations, which has been active over the years in making independent campaign expenditures, as in the previous two elections involving Senator Feingold.  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  During the 1998 campaign, for example, WRTL&#x92;s PAC spent $60,000 to oppose him.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In 2004, however, despite a sharp nationwide increase in PAC receipts, WRTL focused its fundraising on its corporate treasury, not the PAC, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;43, and took in only $17,000 in PAC contributions, as against over $150,000 during 2000, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;42.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Throughout the 2004 senatorial campaign, WRTL made no secret of its views about who should win the election and explicitly tied its position to the filibuster issue.  Its PAC issued at least two press releases saying that its &#x93;Top Election Priorities&#x94; were to &#x93;Re-elect George W. Bush&#x94; and &#x93;Send Feingold Packing!&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 78&#x96;80, 82&#x96;84.  In one of these, the Chair of WRTL&#x92;s PAC was quoted as saying, &#x93; &#x91;We do not want Russ Feingold to continue to have the ability to thwart President Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 82&#x96;83.  The Spring 2004 issue of the WRTL PAC&#x92;s quarterly magazine ran an article headlined &#x93;Radically Pro-Abortion Feingold Must Go!&#x94;, which reported that &#x93;Feingold has been active in his opposition to Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees&#x94; and said that &#x93;the defeat of Feingold must be uppermost in the minds of Wisconsin&#x92;s pro-life community in the 2004 elections.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 101&#x96;103.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    It was under these circumstances that WRTL ran the three television and radio ads in question.  The bills for them were not paid by WRTL&#x92;s PAC, but out of the general treasury with its substantial proportion of corporate contributions; in fact, corporations earmarked more than $50,000 specifically to pay for the ads, <em>id.</em>, at 41.  Each one criticized an unnamed &#x93;group of Senators&#x94; for &#x93;using the filibuster delay tactic to block federal judicial nominees from a simple &#x91;yes&#x92; or &#x91;no&#x92; vote,&#x94; and described the Senators&#x92; actions as &#x93;politics at work, causing gridlock and backing up some of our courts to a state of emergency.&#x94;<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>  They exhorted viewers and listeners to &#x93;[c]ontact Senators Feingold and Kohl and tell them to oppose the filibuster,&#x94; but instead of providing a phone number or e-mail address, they told the audience to go to BeFair.org, a website set up by WRTL.  A visit to this website would erase any doubt a listener or viewer might have as to whether Senators Feingold and Kohl were part of the &#x93;group&#x94; condemned in the ads: it displayed a document that criticized the two Senators for voting to filibuster &#x93;16 out of 16 times&#x94; and accused them of &#x93;putting politics into the court system, creating gridlock, and costing taxpayers money.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 86.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL&#x92;s planned airing of the ads had no apparent relation to any Senate filibuster vote but was keyed to the timing of the senatorial election.  WRTL began broadcasting the ads on July 26, 2004, four days after the Senate recessed for the summer, and although the filibuster controversy raged on through 2005, WRTL did not resume running the ads after the election.  <em>Id.</em>, at 29, 32.

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, any Wisconsin voter who paid attention would have known that Democratic Senator Feingold supported filibusters against Republican presidential judicial nominees, that the propriety of the filibusters was a major issue in the senatorial campaign, and that WRTL along with the Senator&#x92;s Republican challengers opposed his reelection because of his position on filibusters.  Any alert voters who heard or saw WRTL&#x92;s ads would have understood that WRTL was telling them that the Senator&#x92;s position on the filibusters should be grounds to vote against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given these facts, it is beyond all reasonable debate that the ads are constitutionally subject to regulation under <em>McConnell</em>.  There, we noted that BCRA was meant to remedy the problem of &#x93;[s]o-called issue ads&#x94; being used &#x93;to advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 126.  We then gave a paradigmatic example of these electioneering ads subject to regulation, saying that &#x93;[l]ittle difference existed . . . between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The WRTL ads were indistinguishable from the Jane Doe ad; they &#x93;condemned [Senator Feingold&#x92;s] record on a particular issue&#x94; and exhorted the public to contact him and &#x93;tell [him] what you think.&#x94;<a name="ZD-16ref" href="#ZD-16" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  And just as anyone who heard the Jane Doe ad would understand that the point was to defeat Doe, anyone who heard the Feingold ads (let alone anyone who went to the website they named) would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.  If it is now unconstitutional to restrict WRTL&#x92;s Feingold ads, then it follows that &#xA7;203 can no longer be applied constitutionally to <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>Jane Doe paradigm.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding that &#xA7;203 is facially constitutional is overruled.  By what steps does the principal opinion reach this unacknowledged result less than four years after <em>McConnell</em> was decided?</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, it lays down a new test to identify a severely limited class of ads that may constitutionally be regulated as electioneering communications, a test that is flatly contrary to <em>McConnell</em>.  An ad is the equivalent of express advocacy and subject to regulation, the opinion says, only if it is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Since the Feingold ads could, in isolation, be read as at least including calls to communicate views on filibusters to the two Senators, those ads cannot be treated as the functional equivalent of express advocacy to elect or defeat anyone, and therefore may not constitutionally be regulated at all.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the same could have been said of the hypothetical Jane Doe ad.  Its spoken message ended with the instruction to tell Doe what the voter thinks.  The same could also have been said of the actual Yellowtail ad.  Yet in <em>McConnell</em>, we gave the Jane Doe ad as the paradigm of a broadcast message that could be constitutionally regulated as election conduct, and we explicitly described the Yellowtail ad as a &#x93;striking example&#x94; of one that was &#x93;clearly intended to influence the election,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 193, and n. 78.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The principal opinion, in other words, simply inverts what we said in <em>McConnell</em>.  While we left open the possibility of a &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure&#x94; issue ad that might not be open to regulation under &#xA7;203, <em>id.</em>, at 206&#x96;207, and n. 88, we meant that an issue ad without campaign advocacy could escape the restriction.  The implication of the adjectives &#x93;genuine&#x94; and &#x93;pure&#x94; is unmistakable: if an ad is reasonably understood as going beyond a discussion of issues (that is, if it can be understood as electoral advocacy), then by definition it is not &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure.&#x94;  But the principal opinion inexplicably wrings the opposite conclusion from those words: if an ad is susceptible to any &#x93;reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; then it must be a &#x93;pure&#x94; or &#x93;genuine&#x94; issue ad.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  This stands <em>McConnell</em> on its head, and on this reasoning it is pos-<span class="softbreak"/>sible that even some ads with magic words could not be regulated.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Second, the principal opinion seems to defend this inversion of <em>McConnell</em> as a necessary alternative to an unadministrable subjective test for the equivalence of express (and regulable) electioneering advocacy.  The principal opinion acknowledges, of course, that in <em>McConnell</em> we said that &#x93;[t]he justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during [the period shortly before an election] if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;  540 U.

            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> were correct that <em>McConnell</em> made the constitutional application of &#xA7;203 contingent on whether a corporation&#x92;s &#x93;motives were pure,&#x94; or its issue advocacy &#x93;subjective[ly] sincer[e],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted), then I, too, might be inclined to reconsider <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s language.  But <em>McConnell</em> did not do that.  It did not purport to draw constitutional lines based on the subjective motivations of corporations (or their principals) sponsoring political ads, but merely described our test for equivalence to express advocacy as resting on the ads&#x92; &#x93;electioneering purpose,&#x94; which will be objectively apparent from those ads&#x92; content and context (as these cases and the examples cited in <em>McConnell </em>readily show).  We therefore held that &#xA7;203 was not substantially overbroad because &#x93;the vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose,&#x94; and consequently could be regulated consistent with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  540 U. S., at 206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, if the studies to which <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> refers were now to inform our reading of <em>McConnell</em>, they would merely underscore the objective character of the proper way to determine whether &#xA7;203 is constitutional as applied to a given ad.  The authors of those studies did not conduct discovery of the &#x93;actua[l] inten[tions],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14, behind any ads; nor, to my knowledge, were the sponsors of campaign ads summoned before researchers to explain their motivations.  The studies merely confirmed that &#x93;reasonable people are &#x2026; able to discern between ads whose primary purpose is to support a candidate and those intended to provide information about a policy issue.&#x94;  J. Krasno &amp; D. Seltz, Buying Time: Television Advertising in the 1998 Congressional Elections 9 (2000).  To be clear, I am not endorsing the precise methodology of those studies (and <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> is correct that we did not do so in <em>McConnell</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13, n. 4); the point is only that the studies relied on a &#x93;reasonable&#x94; person&#x92;s understanding of the ads&#x92; apparent purpose, and thus were no less objective than <span class="smallcaps">The</span>

        <p class="bodytext">    A similarly mistaken fear of an unadministrable and speech-chilling subjective regime seems to underlie <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice&#x92;</span>s unwillingness to acknowledge the part that consideration of an ad&#x92;s context necessarily plays in any realistic assessment of its meaning.  A reasonable Wisconsinite watching or listening to WRTL&#x92;s ads would likely ask and answer some obvious questions about their circumstances.  Is the group that sponsors these ads the same one publicly campaigning against Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection?  <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> says that this information is &#x93;beside the point,&#x94; because WRTL&#x92;s history of overt electioneering only &#x93;goes to [its] subjective intent.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Did these &#x93;issue&#x94; ads begin appearing on the air during the election season, rather than at the time the filibuster &#x93;issue&#x94; was in fact being debated in the Senate?  This, too, is said to be irrelevant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  And does the website to which WRTL&#x92;s ads direct viewers contain material expressly advocating Senator Feingold&#x92;s defeat?  This enquiry is dismissed as being &#x93;one step removed from the text of the ads themselves.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  But these questions are central to the meaning of the ads, and any reasonable person would take account of circumstances in coming to understand the object of WRTL&#x92;s ad.  And why not?  Each of the contextual facts here can be established by an objective look at a public record; none requires a voter (or a litigant) to engage in discovery of evidence about WRTL&#x92;s operations or internal communications, and none goes to a hidden state of mind.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This refusal to see and hear what any listener to WRTL&#x92;s ads would actually consider produces a rule no different in practice from the one adopted by the District Court, which declined to look beyond the &#x93;four corners&#x94; of the ads themselves.  466 F.

            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> ostensibly stops short of categorically foreclosing consideration of context, see <em>ante</em>, at 20, the application of his test here makes it difficult to see how relevant contextual evidence could ever be taken into account the way it was in <em>McConnell</em>,<a name="ZD-19ref" href="#ZD-19" class="">

        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Third, it may be that the principal opinion rejects <em>McConnell </em>on the erroneous assumption that &#xA7;203 flatly bans independent electioneering communications by a corporation.  <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> argues that corporations must receive &#x93;the benefit of any doubt,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16,<em/>whenever we undertake the task of &#x93;separating &#x2026; political speech protected under the

            <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 203&#x96;204 (quoting <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 162).  Thus, a successful as-applied challenger to &#xA7;203 should necessarily show, at the least, that it could not constitutionally be subjected to the administrative rules that govern a PAC&#x92;s formation and operation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 163.  This would be an uphill fight, after our repeated affirmations that the PAC structure does not impose excessive burdens, <em>ibid.</em> (citing <em>National Right to Work Comm.</em>, 459 U. S., at 201&#x96;202), and WRTL has a particularly weak position on this point: it set up its own PAC long before the 2004 election, used it to campaign openly against Senator Feingold in the past, and could have raised noncorporate donations to it in the 2004 election cycle.  Any argument that establishing and maintaining a PAC is unconstitutionally burdensome for WRTL would thus likely be futile, and certainly should not prevail on WRTL&#x92;s summary judgment motion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, even without the PAC alternative, it would be untrue that &#xA7;203 &#x93;banned&#x94; WRTL from saying anything a genuine issue ad would say, for WRTL could have availed itself of either or both of the following additional options.  It is undisputed that WRTL&#x92;s ads could have been broadcast lawfully in the runup to the election (and bankrolled from WRTL&#x92;s general treasury) if Senator Feingold&#x92;s name had been omitted and the Senator not otherwise singled out.  Since members of today&#x92;s majority apparently view WRTL&#x92;s broadcasts either as &#x93;genuine issue ad[s],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16 (opinion of <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>), or as &#x93;lobby[ing] Wisconsin voters concerning the filibustering of the President&#x92;s judicial nominees,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 2 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.,</span> concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a claim that omitting Senator Feingold&#x92;s name would &#x93;ban&#x94; WRTL&#x92;s message is specious.  Yet one searches my Brothers&#x92; opinions in vain for any persuasive reason why substituting the phrase &#x93;Contact your Senators&#x94; for the phrase &#x93;Contact Senators Feingold and Kohl&#x94; would have denied WRTL a constitutionally sufficient (and clearly lawful) alternative way to send its message.  If WRTL is to be believed when it claims that the issue was the point of the ads, it would have lost nothing by referring simply to the &#x93;Senators.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the suggestion that &#xA7;203 is a ban on political speech is belied by <em>MCFL</em>&#x92;s safe harbor for nonprofit advocacy corporations: under that rule, WRTL would have been free to attack Senator Feingold by name at any time with ads funded from its corporate treasury, if it had not also chosen to serve as a funnel for hundreds of thousands of dollars from other corporations.  Thus, what is called a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech is a limit on the financing of electioneering broadcasts by entities that refuse to take advantage of the PAC structure but insist on acting as conduits from the campaign war chests of business corporations.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, <em>McConnell</em> does not graft a subjective standard onto campaign regulation, the context of campaign advertising cannot sensibly be ignored, and &#xA7;203 is not a ban on speech.  What cannot be gainsaid, in any event, is that in treating these subjects as it does, the operative opinion produces the result of overruling <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding on &#xA7;203, less than four years in the Reports.  Anyone who doubts that need merely ask what the law would have been if, back in 2003, this Court had held &#xA7;203 facially unconstitutional.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    BCRA&#x92;s definition of &#x93;electioneering communication,&#x94; which identifies the communications regulable under &#xA7;203, includes a backup to be used if the primary definition &#x93;is held to be constitutionally insufficient by final judicial decision to support the regulation provided herein.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_A_ii" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(A)(ii)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If this should occur, &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; is to be defined as </p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This backup sounds familiar because it is essentially identical to <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s test for evaluating an as-applied challenge to the original definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94;: regulation is permissible only if the communication is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16.  Thus does the principal opinion institute the very standard that would have prevailed if the Court formally overruled <em>McConnell</em>.  There is neither a theoretical nor a practical basis to claim that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s treatment of &#xA7;203 survives.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">E</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The price of <em>McConnell&#x92;</em>s<em/>demise as authority on &#xA7;203 seems to me to be a high one.  The Court (and, I think, the country) loses when important precedent is overruled without good reason, and there is no justification for departing from our usual rule of <em>stare decisis</em> here.  The same combination of alternatives that was available to corporations affected by <em>McConnell</em> in 2003 is available today: WRTL could have run a newspaper ad, could have paid for the broadcast ads through its PAC, could have established itself as an <em>MCFL</em> organization free of corporate money, and could have said &#x93;call your Senators&#x94; instead of naming Senator Feingold in its ads broadcasted just before the election.  Nothing in the related law surrounding &#xA7;203 has changed in any way, let alone in any way that undermines <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>rationale.  See <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Nor can any serious argument be made that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding has been &#x93;unworkable in practice.&#x94;  <em>Allied-Signal, Inc.</em> v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation</em>,

            </a>  Although WRTL contends that the as-applied remedy has proven to be &#x93;[i]nadequate&#x94; because such challenges cannot be litigated quickly enough to avoid being mooted, Brief for Appellee 65&#x96;66, nothing prevents an advertiser from obtaining a preliminary injunction if it can qualify for one, and WRTL does not point to any evidence that district courts have been unable to rule on any such matters in a timely way.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, it goes without saying that nothing has changed about the facts.  In Justice Frankfurter&#x92;s words, they demonstrate a threat to &#x93;the integrity of our electoral process,&#x94; <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 570, which for a century now Congress has repeatedly found to be imperiled by corporate, and later union, money: witness the Tillman Act, Taft-Hartley, FECA, and BCRA.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  <em>McConnell </em>was our latest decision vindicating clear and reasonable boundaries that Congress has drawn to limit &#x93; &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth,&#x92; &#x94; 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660), and the decision could claim the justification of ongoing fact as well as decisional history in recognizing Congress&#x92;s authority to protect the integrity of elections from the distortion of corporate and union funds.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After today, the ban on contributions by corporations and unions and the limitation on their corrosive spending when they enter the political arena are open to easy circumvention, and the possibilities for regulating corporate and union campaign money are unclear.  The ban on contributions will mean nothing much, now that companies and unions can save candidates the expense of advertising directly, simply by running &#x93;issue ads&#x94; without express advocacy, or by funneling the money through an independent corporation like WRTL.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the understanding of the voters and the Congress that this kind of corporate and union spending seriously jeopardizes the integrity of democratic government will remain.  The facts are too powerful to be ignored, and further efforts at campaign finance reform will come.  It is only the legal landscape that now is altered, and it may be that today&#x92;s departure from precedent will drive further reexamination of the constitutional analysis: of the distinction between contributions and expenditures, or the relation between spending and speech, which have given structure to our thinking since <em>Buckley</em> itself was decided.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    I cannot tell what the future will force upon us, but I respectfully dissent from this judgment today.</p>

.  Ante, at 7 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Bellotti, however, concerned corporate spending in connection with a referendum, and we went out of our way in that case to avoid casting any doubt upon the constitutionality of limiting corporate expenditures during candidate elections.  We said:


&#x93;The overriding concern behind the enactment of [the federal restrictions on corporate contributions and expenditures] was the problem of corruption of elected representatives through the creation of political debts.  The importance of the governmental interest in preventing this occurrence has never been doubted.  The case before us presents no comparable problem, and our consideration of a corporation&#x92;s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.  Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.&#x94;  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26 (citations omitted).


Eight years before Austin, we unanimously reaffirmed that Bellotti &#x93;specifically pointed out that in elections of candidates to public office, unlike in referenda on issues of general public interest, there may well be a threat of real or apparent corruption.&#x94;  Federal Election Comm&#x92;n v.

Then, four years later, in MCFL, we also noted that an expenditure limit offering corporations a PAC alternative is &#x93;distinguishable from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for political speech&#x94; that we addressed in Bellotti.  479 U.

So Austin did not &#x93;stra[y]&#x94; from Bellotti, ante, at 7 (opinion of Scalia, J.); the reasons Bellotti was not controlling in Austin had been clearly foreshadowed in Bellotti itself and confirmed repeatedly in our decisions leading up to Austin.

&#x93;Especially beginning in 1996, issue advocacy during the campaign season dramatically expanded in Wisconsin.
.....


&#x93;The Commission concludes that, in each of these cases, the expenditures were clearly campaign-oriented activities.  They were quite clearly designed to influence the electoral process.  They were focused either on electing or defeating a candidate.  The Commission bases this conclusion on the following points:


&#x93;Although those paying for the activities claimed they were aimed solely at educating voters on the issues, they each mentioned the names of candidates for office.


&#x93;They occurred only when election races were in progress that involved a contest between an incumbent and a challenger.  When the election was over, the activities ended.


&#x93;The activity has occurred after legislative sessions when the issues about which advocacy was occurring were not being deliberated by the legislature.


&#x93;The activity occurred in campaign season, between the candidate&#x92;s filing for candidacy and election time.  Advertisements of this sort have tended to occur at virtually no other time.


&#x93;The activity involved the electronic media, mass mailings, or centrally located telephone banks.
.....


&#x93;The explosive growth of campaign-based advocacy, without even disclosure of its activities and funding sources, poses a grave risk to the integrity of elections. It has created a two-tiered campaign process: one, based in candidates and political parties, which is tightly regulated and controlled; the other, based in interest group activity under the guise of &#x91;issue advocacy&#x92; but actually quite clearly election-focused, which lies beyond accountability.&#x94;  1 Governor&#x92;s Blue-Ribbon Commission on Campaign Finance Reform, State of Wisconsin: Report of the Commission, available at http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-17" href="#ZD-17ref">17</a> The Chief Justice says that Buckley v. Valeo, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
 (per curiam), &#x93;already rejected&#x94; any test that calls for an assessment of the intent and effect of corporate electioneering.  Ante, at 13.  The &#x93;reject[ion]&#x94; to which The Chief Justice presumably refers is Buckley&#x92;s quotation of Thomas v. Collins, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/516" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 516</a> (1945)
, where we found impermissibly vague a statute that permitted a union leader to &#x93; &#x91;laud unionism&#x92; &#x94; but forbade him to &#x93;imply an invitation&#x94; to join a union.  Id., at 534.  The problem with this predicament, we reasoned, was the lack of a clearly permissible opportunity for expression:  Whether words &#x93;designed to fall short of invitation would miss that mark is a question both of intent and of effect,&#x94; and no speaker &#x93;safely could assume that anything he might say &#x2026; would not be understood by some as an invitation.&#x94;  Id., at 535.  We then specified that the speaker in Thomas was left with an impermissibly limited universe of &#x93;three choices: (1) to stand on his right and speak freely; (2) to quit, refusing entirely to speak; (3) to trim, and even thus to risk the penalty.&#x94;  Id., at 536.


The Chief Justice implies that considering the intent and effect of corporate advertising during as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203 would put corporations in precisely the same bind; thus, he wonders how McConnell could use the language of intent and effect without &#x93;even address[ing] what Buckley&#x94; (and by extension, Thomas) &#x93;had to say on the subject.&#x94;  Ante, at 14.  But one need not look far in our McConnell opinion to understand why we thought that corporations have more than the constrained set of options available to the union leader in Thomas.  Just a few sentences after holding that ads with electioneering intent and effect are regulable, we gave this explanation: &#x93;in the future corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads [shortly before an election] by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.  In other words, corporations can find refuge in constitutionally sufficient and clearly delineated safe harbors by modifying the content of their ads (by omitting a candidate&#x92;s name) or by altering the sources of their ads&#x92; financing (from general treasuries to PACs).  The Chief Justice thus wrongly jettisons our conclusions about the constitutionality of regulating ads with electioneering purpose; we meant what we said in McConnell, and we did not overlook 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence when we said it.  Whereas The Chief Justice says that BCRA &#x93;should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights,&#x94; ante, at 14, we already held in McConnell that the campaign finance law accomplishes precisely that.
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-18" href="#ZD-18ref">18</a> The Chief Justice speculates that McConnell derived its test for functional equivalence from &#x93;[t]wo key studies,&#x94; ante, at 12, but not a shred of language in McConnell supports that theory.  In stating the legal standard, McConnell made no mention of any study.  What is the authority, then, for asserting that the studies were pivotal to the standard we announced in McConnell?  See ante, at 12.  Other than WRTL&#x92;s brief, The Chief Justice cites only Judge Henderson&#x92;s separate district court opinion in McConnell.  Ante, at 12.  But The Chief Justice quotes one part of Judge Henderson&#x92;s analysis and neglects to mention that she in turn was quoting the lead author of one of the studies in question: &#x93;According to the Brennan Center, the Buying Time reports were &#x91;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of&#x92; BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions &#x91;in support of their constitutional validity.&#x92; &#x94;  McConnell, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 307&#x96;308 (opinion of Henderson, J.) (italics in original) (quoting deposition of Craig P. Holman, principal co-author of Buying Time 2000: Television Advertising in the 2000 Federal Elections (Brennan Center 2001)).

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-19" href="#ZD-19ref">19</a> Like the District Court, the only bit of context The Chief Justice would allow the reasonable listener is the congressional agenda: whether the &#x93; &#x91;issue&#x92; &#x94; addressed in an ad currently is, or soon will be, &#x93; &#x91;the subject of legislative scrutiny.&#x92; &#x94;  Ante, at 20 (quoting 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 207).  For example, The Chief Justice says, there would have been &#x93;no reason&#x94; to think that WRTL&#x92;s ad constituted anything but a pure issue ad if it addressed a bill pending during Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection campaign, such as the Universal National Service Act.  Ante, at 17.  It is revealing, of course, that The Chief Justice does not invoke the filibuster issue, the subject of WRTL&#x92;s ads, as the legislative matter with particular salience during the 2004 election.  But why the reasonable listener can look to Congress but not the calendar on the wall or a WRTL website is difficult to fathom.
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-20" href="#ZD-20ref">20</a>Justice Scalia also adopts the same misconception that &#xA7;203 is a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech.  See ante, at 18 (&#x93;Section 203&#x92;s line is bright, but it bans vast amounts of political advocacy indistinguishable from hitherto protected speech&#x94;).
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-21" href="#ZD-21ref">21</a> These as-applied challenges provide no reason to second-guess our conclusion in McConnell that the rule for differentiating between electioneering ads and genuine issue ads is administrable.  WRTL&#x92;s ads clearly have an electioneering purpose and, as explained above, fall comfortably within the heartland of electioneering communications that &#xA7;203 may validly regulate.  Thus, although Justice Scalia claims that &#x93;[t]oday&#x92;s cases make it apparent&#x94; that McConnell must be overruled, ante, at 18, there is nothing about today&#x92;s cases that suggests that McConnell is unworkable.  We therefore have no occasion to reconsider McConnell from first principles.

        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensable ingredient of a political candidacy is money for advertising.  In the 2004 campaign, more than half of the combined expenditures by the two principal presidential candidates (excluding fundraising) went for media time and space.  See The Costliest Campaign, Washington Post, Dec. 30, 2004, p. A7.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>2</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And in the 2005&#x96;2006 election cycle, the expenditure of more than $2 billion on television shattered the previous record, even without a presidential contest.  See Inside Media, MediaWeek, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 18.  The portent is for still greater spending.  By the end of March 2007, almost a year before the first primary and more than 18 months before the general election, presidential candidates had already raised over $150 million.  See Balz, Fundraising Totals Challenge Early Campaign Assumptions, Washington Post, Apr. 17, 2007, p. A1 (citing figures and noting that &#x93;[t]he campaign is living up to its reputation as the most expensive in U. S. history&#x94;).  To reach this total, the leading fundraisers collected over $250,000 per day in the first quarter of 2007, Mullins, Clinton Leads the Money Race, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2007, p. A8, and the eventual nominees are expected to raise $500 million apiece (about $680,000 per day over a 2-year election cycle), Kirkpatrick and Pilhofer, McCain Lags in Income But Excels in Spending, Report Shows, N. Y. Times, Apr. 15, 2007, p. 20.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensability of these huge sums has two significant consequences for American Government that are particularly on point here.  The enormous demands, first, assign power to deep pockets.  See Balz, <em>supra</em>, at A6 (&#x93;For all the interest in Internet fundraising, big donors still ruled in the first quarter, with roughly 80 percent of donations coming in amounts of $1,000 or more&#x94;).  Candidates occasionally boast about the number of contributors they have, but the headlines speaking in dollars reflect political reality.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Mullins, <em>supra</em>, at A8 (headlined &#x93;Clinton Leads the Money Race&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Some major contributors get satisfaction from pitching in for their candidates, but political preference fails to account for the frequency of giving &#x93;substantial sums to <em>both</em> major national parties,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 148, a practice driven &#x93;by stark political pragmatism, not by ideological support for either party or their candidates,&#x94; Brief for Committee for Economic Development et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> in <em>McConnell</em>, O. T. 2003, No. 02&#x96;1674, p. 3 (hereinafter CED Brief).  What the high-dollar pragmatists of either variety get is special access to the officials they help elect, and with it a disproportionate influence on those in power.  See <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em/>at 130&#x96;131.  As the erstwhile officer of a large American corporation put it, &#x93; &#x91;[b]usiness leaders believe&#x97;based on experience and with good reason&#x97;that &#x2026; access gives them an opportunity to shape and affect governmental decisions and that their ability to do so derives from the fact that they have given large sums of money to the parties.&#x92; &#x94;  CED Brief 9.  At a critical level, contributions that underwrite elections are leverage for enormous political influence.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Voters know this.  Hence, the second important consequence of the demand for big money to finance publicity: pervasive public cynicism.  A 2002 poll found that 71 percent of Americans think Members of Congress cast votes based on the views of their big contributors, even when those views differ from the Member&#x92;s own beliefs about what is best for the country.  Mellman &amp; Wirthlin 267; see also <em>id.</em>, at 266 (&#x93;In public opinion research it is uncommon to have 70 percent or more of the public see an issue the same way.  When they do, it indicates an unusually strong agreement on that issue&#x94;).  The same percentage believes that the will of contributors tempts Members to vote against the majority view of their constituents.  <em>Id.</em>, at 267.  Almost half of Americans believe that Members often decide how to vote based on what big contributors to their party want, while only a quarter think Members often base their votes on perceptions of what is best for the country or their constituents.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Devoting concentrations of money in self-interested hands to the support of political campaigning therefore threatens the capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents and the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves.  These are the elements summed up in the notion of political integrity, giving it a value second to none in a free society.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the threat to this value flowing from concentrations of money in politics has reached an unprecedented enormity, it has been gathering force for generations.  Before the turn of the last century, as now, it was obvious that the purchase of influence and the cynicism of voters threaten the integrity and stability of democratic government, each derived from the responsiveness of its law to the interests of citizens and their confidence in that focus.  The danger has traditionally seemed at its apex when no reasonable limits constrain the campaign activities of organizations whose &#x93;unique legal and economic characteristics&#x94; are tailored to &#x93;facilitat[e] the amassing of large treasuries,&#x94; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    At the same time, Congress had another worry that foreshadows our case today.  It was concerned that the statutory prohibition on corporate &#x93;contribution[s]&#x94; was being so narrowly construed as to open a &#x93;loophole whereby corporations, national banks, and labor organizations are enabled to avoid the obviously intended restrictive policy of the statute by garbing their financial assistance in the form of an &#x91;expenditure&#x92; rather than a contribution.&#x94;  S. Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38&#x96;39 (1947); see also H. Rep.

Of what avail would a law be to prohibit the contributing direct to a candidate and yet permit the expenditure of large sums in his behalf?&#x94;).

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/441b.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;441b</a>, and drew two conclusions implicated in the present case.  First, we construed the &#x93;in connection with&#x94; phrase in much the same way we had interpreted comparable FECA language challenged in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    We thus held that the prohibition applied &#x93;only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 44.  &#x93;[E]xpress terms,&#x94; in turn, meant what had already become known as &#x93;magic words,&#x94; such as &#x93; &#x91;vote for,&#x92; &#x91;elect,&#x92; &#x91;support,&#x92; &#x91;cast your ballot for,&#x92; &#x91;Smith for Congress,&#x92; &#x91;vote against,&#x92; &#x91;defeat,&#x92; &#x91;reject.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>,<em/>n. 52.  The consequence of this construction was obvious: it pulled the teeth out of the statute, as we had understood when we announced it in its earlier application in Buckley:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness &#x2026; undermines the limitation&#x92;s effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or officeholder.  It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate&#x92;s campaign.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 45.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nor was the statute, even as thus narrowed, enforceable against the particular advocacy corporation challenging the limit in <em>MCFL</em>.

We held that this &#x93;legitima[te]&#x94; concern could not reasonably extend to electioneering expenditures by the corporation at issue in <em>MCFL</em>, which neither &#x93;engage[d] in business activities&#x94; nor accepted donations from business corporations and unions (and thus could not serve as a &#x93;condui[t]&#x94; for political spending by those entities).  <em>Id.</em>, at 263&#x96;264.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    An issue ad is an advertisement on a political subject urging the reader or listener to let a politician know what he thinks, but containing no magic words telling the recipient to vote for or against anyone.

Experience showed, however, just what we foresaw in <em>Buckley</em>, that the line between &#x93;issue&#x94; broadcasts and outright electioneering was a patent fiction, as in the example of a television &#x93;issue ad&#x94; that ran during a Montana congressional race between Republican Rick Hill and Democrat Bill Yellowtail in 1996:</p>

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  We rejected any suggestion &#x93;that <em>Buckley</em> drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy [with magic words] and so-called issue advocacy [without them], and that speakers possess an inviolable 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to engage in the latter category of speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 190.  To the contrary, we held that &#x93;our decisions in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em> were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 192&#x96;193.  &#x93;[T]he presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech,&#x94; which is prohibitable, &#x93;from a true issue ad,&#x94; we said, since ads that &#x93;esche[w] the use of magic words &#x2026; are no less clearly intended to influence the election.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 193.  We thus found &#x93;[l]ittle difference &#x2026; between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We understood that Congress had a compelling interest in limiting this sort of electioneering by corporations and unions, for &#xA7;203 exemplified a tradition of &#x93;repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U.

Nor did we see any plausible claim of substantial overbreadth from incidentally prohibiting ads genuinely focused on issues rather than elections, given the limitation of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; by time, geographical coverage, and clear reference to candidate.  &#x93;Far from establishing that BCRA&#x92;s application to pure issue ads is substantial, either in an absolute sense or relative to its application to election-related advertising, the record strongly supports the contrary conclusion.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 207.  Finally, we underscored the reasonableness of the &#xA7;203 line by emphasizing that it defined a category of limited, but not prohibited, corporate and union speech: &#x93;Because corporations can still fund electioneering communications with PAC money, it is &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression rather than a regulation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 204 (quoting <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em> v. <em>Beaumont</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, Congress in 1907 prohibited corporate contributions to candidates and in 1943 applied the same ban to unions.  In 1947, Congress extended the complete ban from contributions to expenditures &#x93;in connection with&#x94; an election, a phrase so vague that in 1986 we held it must be confined to instances of express advocacy using magic words.  Congress determined, in 2002, that corporate and union expenditures for fake issue ads devoid of magic words should be regulated using a narrow definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; to reach only broadcast ads that were the practical equivalents of express advocacy.  In 2003, this Court found the provision free from vagueness and justified by the concern that drove its enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This century-long tradition of legislation and judicial precedent rests on facing undeniable facts and testifies to an equally undeniable value.  Campaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries, with no redolence of &#x93;grassroots&#x94; about them.  Neither Congress&#x92;s decisions nor our own have understood the corrupting influence of money in politics as being limited to outright bribery or discrete <em>quid pro quo; </em>campaign finance reform has instead consistently focused on the more pervasive distortion of electoral institutions by concentrated wealth, on the special access and guaranteed favor that sap the representative integrity of American government and defy public confidence in its institutions.  From early in the 20th century through the decision in <em>McConnell</em>, we have acknowledged that the value of democratic integrity justifies a realistic response when corporations and labor organizations commit the concentrated moneys in their treasuries to electioneering.</p>

            </a>  In 2004, WRTL accepted over $315,000 in corporate donations, App. 40, and of its six general fund contributions of $50,000 or more between 2002 and 2005, three, including the largest (for $140,000), came from corporate donors, <em>id.</em>, at 118&#x96;121.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL also runs a PAC, funded by individual donations, which has been active over the years in making independent campaign expenditures, as in the previous two elections involving Senator Feingold.  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  During the 1998 campaign, for example, WRTL&#x92;s PAC spent $60,000 to oppose him.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In 2004, however, despite a sharp nationwide increase in PAC receipts, WRTL focused its fundraising on its corporate treasury, not the PAC, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;43, and took in only $17,000 in PAC contributions, as against over $150,000 during 2000, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;42.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Throughout the 2004 senatorial campaign, WRTL made no secret of its views about who should win the election and explicitly tied its position to the filibuster issue.  Its PAC issued at least two press releases saying that its &#x93;Top Election Priorities&#x94; were to &#x93;Re-elect George W. Bush&#x94; and &#x93;Send Feingold Packing!&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 78&#x96;80, 82&#x96;84.  In one of these, the Chair of WRTL&#x92;s PAC was quoted as saying, &#x93; &#x91;We do not want Russ Feingold to continue to have the ability to thwart President Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 82&#x96;83.  The Spring 2004 issue of the WRTL PAC&#x92;s quarterly magazine ran an article headlined &#x93;Radically Pro-Abortion Feingold Must Go!&#x94;, which reported that &#x93;Feingold has been active in his opposition to Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees&#x94; and said that &#x93;the defeat of Feingold must be uppermost in the minds of Wisconsin&#x92;s pro-life community in the 2004 elections.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 101&#x96;103.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    It was under these circumstances that WRTL ran the three television and radio ads in question.  The bills for them were not paid by WRTL&#x92;s PAC, but out of the general treasury with its substantial proportion of corporate contributions; in fact, corporations earmarked more than $50,000 specifically to pay for the ads, <em>id.</em>, at 41.  Each one criticized an unnamed &#x93;group of Senators&#x94; for &#x93;using the filibuster delay tactic to block federal judicial nominees from a simple &#x91;yes&#x92; or &#x91;no&#x92; vote,&#x94; and described the Senators&#x92; actions as &#x93;politics at work, causing gridlock and backing up some of our courts to a state of emergency.&#x94;<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>  They exhorted viewers and listeners to &#x93;[c]ontact Senators Feingold and Kohl and tell them to oppose the filibuster,&#x94; but instead of providing a phone number or e-mail address, they told the audience to go to BeFair.org, a website set up by WRTL.  A visit to this website would erase any doubt a listener or viewer might have as to whether Senators Feingold and Kohl were part of the &#x93;group&#x94; condemned in the ads: it displayed a document that criticized the two Senators for voting to filibuster &#x93;16 out of 16 times&#x94; and accused them of &#x93;putting politics into the court system, creating gridlock, and costing taxpayers money.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 86.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL&#x92;s planned airing of the ads had no apparent relation to any Senate filibuster vote but was keyed to the timing of the senatorial election.  WRTL began broadcasting the ads on July 26, 2004, four days after the Senate recessed for the summer, and although the filibuster controversy raged on through 2005, WRTL did not resume running the ads after the election.  <em>Id.</em>, at 29, 32.  During the campaign period that the ads did cover, Senator Feingold&#x92;s support of the filibusters was a prominent issue.  His position was well known,<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, any Wisconsin voter who paid attention would have known that Democratic Senator Feingold supported filibusters against Republican presidential judicial nominees, that the propriety of the filibusters was a major issue in the senatorial campaign, and that WRTL along with the Senator&#x92;s Republican challengers opposed his reelection because of his position on filibusters.  Any alert voters who heard or saw WRTL&#x92;s ads would have understood that WRTL was telling them that the Senator&#x92;s position on the filibusters should be grounds to vote against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given these facts, it is beyond all reasonable debate that the ads are constitutionally subject to regulation under <em>McConnell</em>.  There, we noted that BCRA was meant to remedy the problem of &#x93;[s]o-called issue ads&#x94; being used &#x93;to advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 126.  We then gave a paradigmatic example of these electioneering ads subject to regulation, saying that &#x93;[l]ittle difference existed . . . between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The WRTL ads were indistinguishable from the Jane Doe ad; they &#x93;condemned [Senator Feingold&#x92;s] record on a particular issue&#x94; and exhorted the public to contact him and &#x93;tell [him] what you think.&#x94;<a name="ZD-16ref" href="#ZD-16" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>16</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And just as anyone who heard the Jane Doe ad would understand that the point was to defeat Doe, anyone who heard the Feingold ads (let alone anyone who went to the website they named) would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.  If it is now unconstitutional to restrict WRTL&#x92;s Feingold ads, then it follows that &#xA7;203 can no longer be applied constitutionally to <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>Jane Doe paradigm.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding that &#xA7;203 is facially constitutional is overruled.  By what steps does the principal opinion reach this unacknowledged result less than four years after <em>McConnell</em> was decided?</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, it lays down a new test to identify a severely limited class of ads that may constitutionally be regulated as electioneering communications, a test that is flatly contrary to <em>McConnell</em>.  An ad is the equivalent of express advocacy and subject to regulation, the opinion says, only if it is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Since the Feingold ads could, in isolation, be read as at least including calls to communicate views on filibusters to the two Senators, those ads cannot be treated as the functional equivalent of express advocacy to elect or defeat anyone, and therefore may not constitutionally be regulated at all.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the same could have been said of the hypothetical Jane Doe ad.  Its spoken message ended with the instruction to tell Doe what the voter thinks.  The same could also have been said of the actual Yellowtail ad.  Yet in <em>McConnell</em>, we gave the Jane Doe ad as the paradigm of a broadcast message that could be constitutionally regulated as election conduct, and we explicitly described the Yellowtail ad as a &#x93;striking example&#x94; of one that was &#x93;clearly intended to influence the election,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 193, and n. 78.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The principal opinion, in other words, simply inverts what we said in <em>McConnell</em>.  While we left open the possibility of a &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure&#x94; issue ad that might not be open to regulation under &#xA7;203, <em>id.</em>, at 206&#x96;207, and n. 88, we meant that an issue ad without campaign advocacy could escape the restriction.  The implication of the adjectives &#x93;genuine&#x94; and &#x93;pure&#x94; is unmistakable: if an ad is reasonably understood as going beyond a discussion of issues (that is, if it can be understood as electoral advocacy), then by definition it is not &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure.&#x94;  But the principal opinion inexplicably wrings the opposite conclusion from those words: if an ad is susceptible to any &#x93;reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; then it must be a &#x93;pure&#x94; or &#x93;genuine&#x94; issue ad.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  This stands <em>McConnell</em> on its head, and on this reasoning it is pos-<span class="softbreak"/>sible that even some ads with magic words could not be regulated.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Second, the principal opinion seems to defend this inversion of <em>McConnell</em> as a necessary alternative to an unadministrable subjective test for the equivalence of express (and regulable) electioneering advocacy.  The principal opinion acknowledges, of course, that in <em>McConnell</em> we said that &#x93;[t]he justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during [the period shortly before an election] if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;  540 U.

But <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> says that statement in <em>McConnell</em> cannot be accepted at face value because we could not, consistent with precedent, have focused our

            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> were correct that <em>McConnell</em> made the constitutional application of &#xA7;203 contingent on whether a corporation&#x92;s &#x93;motives were pure,&#x94; or its issue advocacy &#x93;subjective[ly] sincer[e],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted), then I, too, might be inclined to reconsider <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s language.  But <em>McConnell</em> did not do that.  It did not purport to draw constitutional lines based on the subjective motivations of corporations (or their principals) sponsoring political ads, but merely described our test for equivalence to express advocacy as resting on the ads&#x92; &#x93;electioneering purpose,&#x94; which will be objectively apparent from those ads&#x92; content and context (as these cases and the examples cited in <em>McConnell </em>readily show).  We therefore held that &#xA7;203 was not substantially overbroad because &#x93;the vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose,&#x94; and consequently could be regulated consistent with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  540 U. S., at 206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, if the studies to which <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> refers were now to inform our reading of <em>McConnell</em>, they would merely underscore the objective character of the proper way to determine whether &#xA7;203 is constitutional as applied to a given ad.  The authors of those studies did not conduct discovery of the &#x93;actua[l] inten[tions],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14, behind any ads; nor, to my knowledge, were the sponsors of campaign ads summoned before researchers to explain their motivations.  The studies merely confirmed that &#x93;reasonable people are &#x2026; able to discern between ads whose primary purpose is to support a candidate and those intended to provide information about a policy issue.&#x94;  J.

To be clear, I am not endorsing the precise methodology of those studies (and <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> is correct that we did not do so in <em>McConnell</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13, n. 4); the point is only that the studies relied on a &#x93;reasonable&#x94; person&#x92;s understanding of the ads&#x92; apparent purpose, and thus were no less objective than <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s own approach.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A similarly mistaken fear of an unadministrable and speech-chilling subjective regime seems to underlie <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice&#x92;</span>s unwillingness to acknowledge the part that consideration of an ad&#x92;s context necessarily plays in any realistic assessment of its meaning.  A reasonable Wisconsinite watching or listening to WRTL&#x92;s ads would likely ask and answer some obvious questions about their circumstances.  Is the group that sponsors these ads the same one publicly campaigning against Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection?  <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> says that this information is &#x93;beside the point,&#x94; because WRTL&#x92;s history of overt electioneering only &#x93;goes to [its] subjective intent.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Did these &#x93;issue&#x94; ads begin appearing on the air during the election season, rather than at the time the filibuster &#x93;issue&#x94; was in fact being debated in the Senate?  This, too, is said to be irrelevant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  And does the website to which WRTL&#x92;s ads direct viewers contain material expressly advocating Senator Feingold&#x92;s defeat?  This enquiry is dismissed as being &#x93;one step removed from the text of the ads themselves.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  But these questions are central to the meaning of the ads, and any reasonable person would take account of circumstances in coming to understand the object of WRTL&#x92;s ad.  And why not?  Each of the contextual facts here can be established by an objective look at a public record; none requires a voter (or a litigant) to engage in discovery of evidence about WRTL&#x92;s operations or internal communications, and none goes to a hidden state of mind.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This refusal to see and hear what any listener to WRTL&#x92;s ads would actually consider produces a rule no different in practice from the one adopted by the District Court, which declined to look beyond the &#x93;four corners&#x94; of the ads themselves.  466 F.

            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> ostensibly stops short of categorically foreclosing consideration of context, see <em>ante</em>, at 20, the application of his test here makes it difficult to see how relevant contextual evidence could ever be taken into account the way it was in <em>McConnell</em>,<a name="ZD-19ref" href="#ZD-19" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Third, it may be that the principal opinion rejects <em>McConnell </em>on the erroneous assumption that &#xA7;203 flatly bans independent electioneering communications by a corporation.  <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> argues that corporations must receive &#x93;the benefit of any doubt,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16,<em/>whenever we undertake the task of &#x93;separating &#x2026; political speech protected under the

            <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 203&#x96;204 (quoting <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 162).  Thus, a successful as-applied challenger to &#xA7;203 should necessarily show, at the least, that it could not constitutionally be subjected to the administrative rules that govern a PAC&#x92;s formation and operation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 163.  This would be an uphill fight, after our repeated affirmations that the PAC structure does not impose excessive burdens, <em>ibid.</em> (citing <em>National Right to Work Comm.</em>, 459 U. S., at 201&#x96;202), and WRTL has a particularly weak position on this point: it set up its own PAC long before the 2004 election, used it to campaign openly against Senator Feingold in the past, and could have raised noncorporate donations to it in the 2004 election cycle.  Any argument that establishing and maintaining a PAC is unconstitutionally burdensome for WRTL would thus likely be futile, and certainly should not prevail on WRTL&#x92;s summary judgment motion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, even without the PAC alternative, it would be untrue that &#xA7;203 &#x93;banned&#x94; WRTL from saying anything a genuine issue ad would say, for WRTL could have availed itself of either or both of the following additional options.  It is undisputed that WRTL&#x92;s ads could have been broadcast lawfully in the runup to the election (and bankrolled from WRTL&#x92;s general treasury) if Senator Feingold&#x92;s name had been omitted and the Senator not otherwise singled out.  Since members of today&#x92;s majority apparently view WRTL&#x92;s broadcasts either as &#x93;genuine issue ad[s],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16 (opinion of <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>), or as &#x93;lobby[ing] Wisconsin voters concerning the filibustering of the President&#x92;s judicial nominees,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 2 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.,</span> concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a claim that omitting Senator Feingold&#x92;s name would &#x93;ban&#x94; WRTL&#x92;s message is specious.  Yet one searches my Brothers&#x92; opinions in vain for any persuasive reason why substituting the phrase &#x93;Contact your Senators&#x94; for the phrase &#x93;Contact Senators Feingold and Kohl&#x94; would have denied WRTL a constitutionally sufficient (and clearly lawful) alternative way to send its message.  If WRTL is to be believed when it claims that the issue was the point of the ads, it would have lost nothing by referring simply to the &#x93;Senators.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the suggestion that &#xA7;203 is a ban on political speech is belied by <em>MCFL</em>&#x92;s safe harbor for nonprofit advocacy corporations: under that rule, WRTL would have been free to attack Senator Feingold by name at any time with ads funded from its corporate treasury, if it had not also chosen to serve as a funnel for hundreds of thousands of dollars from other corporations.  Thus, what is called a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech is a limit on the financing of electioneering broadcasts by entities that refuse to take advantage of the PAC structure but insist on acting as conduits from the campaign war chests of business corporations.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, <em>McConnell</em> does not graft a subjective standard onto campaign regulation, the context of campaign advertising cannot sensibly be ignored, and &#xA7;203 is not a ban on speech.  What cannot be gainsaid, in any event, is that in treating these subjects as it does, the operative opinion produces the result of overruling <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding on &#xA7;203, less than four years in the Reports.  Anyone who doubts that need merely ask what the law would have been if, back in 2003, this Court had held &#xA7;203 facially unconstitutional.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    BCRA&#x92;s definition of &#x93;electioneering communication,&#x94; which identifies the communications regulable under &#xA7;203, includes a backup to be used if the primary definition &#x93;is held to be constitutionally insufficient by final judicial decision to support the regulation provided herein.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_A_ii" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(A)(ii)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If this should occur, &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; is to be defined as </p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This backup sounds familiar because it is essentially identical to <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s test for evaluating an as-applied challenge to the original definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94;: regulation is permissible only if the communication is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16.  Thus does the principal opinion institute the very standard that would have prevailed if the Court formally overruled <em>McConnell</em>.  There is neither a theoretical nor a practical basis to claim that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s treatment of &#xA7;203 survives.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">E</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The price of <em>McConnell&#x92;</em>s<em/>demise as authority on &#xA7;203 seems to me to be a high one.  The Court (and, I think, the country) loses when important precedent is overruled without good reason, and there is no justification for departing from our usual rule of <em>stare decisis</em> here.  The same combination of alternatives that was available to corporations affected by <em>McConnell</em> in 2003 is available today: WRTL could have run a newspaper ad, could have paid for the broadcast ads through its PAC, could have established itself as an <em>MCFL</em> organization free of corporate money, and could have said &#x93;call your Senators&#x94; instead of naming Senator Feingold in its ads broadcasted just before the election.  Nothing in the related law surrounding &#xA7;203 has changed in any way, let alone in any way that undermines <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>rationale.  See <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>,

.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nor can any serious argument be made that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding has been &#x93;unworkable in practice.&#x94;  <em>Allied-Signal, Inc.</em> v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation</em>,

            </a>  Although WRTL contends that the as-applied remedy has proven to be &#x93;[i]nadequate&#x94; because such challenges cannot be litigated quickly enough to avoid being mooted, Brief for Appellee 65&#x96;66, nothing prevents an advertiser from obtaining a preliminary injunction if it can qualify for one, and WRTL does not point to any evidence that district courts have been unable to rule on any such matters in a timely way.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, it goes without saying that nothing has changed about the facts.  In Justice Frankfurter&#x92;s words, they demonstrate a threat to &#x93;the integrity of our electoral process,&#x94; <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 570, which for a century now Congress has repeatedly found to be imperiled by corporate, and later union, money: witness the Tillman Act, Taft-Hartley, FECA, and BCRA.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  <em>McConnell </em>was our latest decision vindicating clear and reasonable boundaries that Congress has drawn to limit &#x93; &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth,&#x92; &#x94; 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660), and the decision could claim the justification of ongoing fact as well as decisional history in recognizing Congress&#x92;s authority to protect the integrity of elections from the distortion of corporate and union funds.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After today, the ban on contributions by corporations and unions and the limitation on their corrosive spending when they enter the political arena are open to easy circumvention, and the possibilities for regulating corporate and union campaign money are unclear.  The ban on contributions will mean nothing much, now that companies and unions can save candidates the expense of advertising directly, simply by running &#x93;issue ads&#x94; without express advocacy, or by funneling the money through an independent corporation like WRTL.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the understanding of the voters and the Congress that this kind of corporate and union spending seriously jeopardizes the integrity of democratic government will remain.  The facts are too powerful to be ignored, and further efforts at campaign finance reform will come.  It is only the legal landscape that now is altered, and it may be that today&#x92;s departure from precedent will drive further reexamination of the constitutional analysis: of the distinction between contributions and expenditures, or the relation between spending and speech, which have given structure to our thinking since <em>Buckley</em> itself was decided.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    I cannot tell what the future will force upon us, but I respectfully dissent from this judgment today.</p>

Justice Scalia asserts that Austin &#x93;strayed far from&#x94; the principles we announced in First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,

.  Ante, at 7 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Bellotti, however, concerned corporate spending in connection with a referendum, and we went out of our way in that case to avoid casting any doubt upon the constitutionality of limiting corporate expenditures during candidate elections.  We said:


&#x93;The overriding concern behind the enactment of [the federal restrictions on corporate contributions and expenditures] was the problem of corruption of elected representatives through the creation of political debts.  The importance of the governmental interest in preventing this occurrence has never been doubted.  The case before us presents no comparable problem, and our consideration of a corporation&#x92;s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.  Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.&#x94;  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26 (citations omitted).


Eight years before Austin, we unanimously reaffirmed that Bellotti &#x93;specifically pointed out that in elections of candidates to public office, unlike in referenda on issues of general public interest, there may well be a threat of real or apparent corruption.&#x94;  Federal Election Comm&#x92;n v.

Then, four years later, in MCFL, we also noted that an expenditure limit offering corporations a PAC alternative is &#x93;distinguishable from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for political speech&#x94; that we addressed in Bellotti.  479 U. S., at 259, n. 12.  So Austin did not &#x93;stra[y]&#x94; from Bellotti, ante, at 7 (opinion of Scalia, J.); the reasons Bellotti was not controlling in Austin had been clearly foreshadowed in Bellotti itself and confirmed repeatedly in our decisions leading up to Austin.

&#x93;Especially beginning in 1996, issue advocacy during the campaign season dramatically expanded in Wisconsin.
.....


&#x93;The Commission concludes that, in each of these cases, the expenditures were clearly campaign-oriented activities.  They were quite clearly designed to influence the electoral process.  They were focused either on electing or defeating a candidate.  The Commission bases this conclusion on the following points:


&#x93;Although those paying for the activities claimed they were aimed solely at educating voters on the issues, they each mentioned the names of candidates for office.


&#x93;They occurred only when election races were in progress that involved a contest between an incumbent and a challenger.  When the election was over, the activities ended.


&#x93;The activity has occurred after legislative sessions when the issues about which advocacy was occurring were not being deliberated by the legislature.


&#x93;The activity occurred in campaign season, between the candidate&#x92;s filing for candidacy and election time.  Advertisements of this sort have tended to occur at virtually no other time.


&#x93;The activity involved the electronic media, mass mailings, or centrally located telephone banks.
.....


&#x93;The explosive growth of campaign-based advocacy, without even disclosure of its activities and funding sources, poses a grave risk to the integrity of elections. It has created a two-tiered campaign process: one, based in candidates and political parties, which is tightly regulated and controlled; the other, based in interest group activity under the guise of &#x91;issue advocacy&#x92; but actually quite clearly election-focused, which lies beyond accountability.&#x94;  1 Governor&#x92;s Blue-Ribbon Commission on Campaign Finance Reform, State of Wisconsin: Report of the Commission, available at http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
 (per curiam), &#x93;already rejected&#x94; any test that calls for an assessment of the intent and effect of corporate electioneering.  Ante, at 13.  The &#x93;reject[ion]&#x94; to which The Chief Justice presumably refers is Buckley&#x92;s quotation of Thomas v. Collins, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/516" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 516</a> (1945)
, where we found impermissibly vague a statute that permitted a union leader to &#x93; &#x91;laud unionism&#x92; &#x94; but forbade him to &#x93;imply an invitation&#x94; to join a union.  Id., at 534.  The problem with this predicament, we reasoned, was the lack of a clearly permissible opportunity for expression:  Whether words &#x93;designed to fall short of invitation would miss that mark is a question both of intent and of effect,&#x94; and no speaker &#x93;safely could assume that anything he might say &#x2026; would not be understood by some as an invitation.&#x94;  Id., at 535.  We then specified that the speaker in Thomas was left with an impermissibly limited universe of &#x93;three choices: (1) to stand on his right and speak freely; (2) to quit, refusing entirely to speak; (3) to trim, and even thus to risk the penalty.&#x94;  Id., at 536.


The Chief Justice implies that considering the intent and effect of corporate advertising during as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203 would put corporations in precisely the same bind; thus, he wonders how McConnell could use the language of intent and effect without &#x93;even address[ing] what Buckley&#x94; (and by extension, Thomas) &#x93;had to say on the subject.&#x94;  Ante, at 14.  But one need not look far in our McConnell opinion to understand why we thought that corporations have more than the constrained set of options available to the union leader in Thomas.  Just a few sentences after holding that ads with electioneering intent and effect are regulable, we gave this explanation: &#x93;in the future corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads [shortly before an election] by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.  In other words, corporations can find refuge in constitutionally sufficient and clearly delineated safe harbors by modifying the content of their ads (by omitting a candidate&#x92;s name) or by altering the sources of their ads&#x92; financing (from general treasuries to PACs).  The Chief Justice thus wrongly jettisons our conclusions about the constitutionality of regulating ads with electioneering purpose; we meant what we said in McConnell, and we did not overlook 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence when we said it.  Whereas The Chief Justice says that BCRA &#x93;should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights,&#x94; ante, at 14, we already held in McConnell that the campaign finance law accomplishes precisely that.

In stating the legal standard, McConnell made no mention of any study.  What is the authority, then, for asserting that the studies were pivotal to the standard we announced in McConnell?  See ante, at 12.  Other than WRTL&#x92;s brief, The Chief Justice cites only Judge Henderson&#x92;s separate district court opinion in McConnell.  Ante, at 12.  But The Chief Justice quotes one part of Judge Henderson&#x92;s analysis and neglects to mention that she in turn was quoting the lead author of one of the studies in question: &#x93;According to the Brennan Center, the Buying Time reports were &#x91;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of&#x92; BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions &#x91;in support of their constitutional validity.&#x92; &#x94;  McConnell, 251 F.

For example, The Chief Justice says, there would have been &#x93;no reason&#x94; to think that WRTL&#x92;s ad constituted anything but a pure issue ad if it addressed a bill pending during Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection campaign, such as the Universal National Service Act.  Ante, at 17.  It is revealing, of course, that The Chief Justice does not invoke the filibuster issue, the subject of WRTL&#x92;s ads, as the legislative matter with particular salience during the 2004 election.  But why the reasonable listener can look to Congress but not the calendar on the wall or a WRTL website is difficult to fathom.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-20" href="#ZD-20ref">20</a>Justice Scalia also adopts the same misconception that &#xA7;203 is a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-21" href="#ZD-21ref">21</a> These as-applied challenges provide no reason to second-guess our conclusion in McConnell that the rule for differentiating between electioneering ads and genuine issue ads is administrable.  WRTL&#x92;s ads clearly have an electioneering purpose and, as explained above, fall comfortably within the heartland of electioneering communications that &#xA7;203 may validly regulate.  Thus, although Justice Scalia claims that &#x93;[t]oday&#x92;s cases make it apparent&#x94; that McConnell must be overruled, ante, at 18, there is nothing about today&#x92;s cases that suggests that McConnell is unworkable.  We therefore have no occasion to reconsider McConnell from first principles.

        <p class="bodytext">    The significance and effect of today&#x92;s judgment, from which I respectfully dissent, turn on three things: the demand for campaign money in huge amounts from large contributors, whose power has produced a cynical electorate; the congressional recognition of the ensuing threat to democratic integrity as reflected in a century of legislation restricting the electoral leverage of concentrations of money in corporate and union treasuries; and <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensable ingredient of a political candidacy is money for advertising.  In the 2004 campaign, more than half of the combined expenditures by the two principal presidential candidates (excluding fundraising) went for media time and space.  See The Costliest Campaign, Washington Post, Dec. 30, 2004, p. A7.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">
                <sup>

                </sup>
            </a>  And in the 2005&#x96;2006 election cycle, the expenditure of more than $2 billion on television shattered the previous record, even without a presidential contest.  See Inside Media, MediaWeek, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 18.  The portent is for still greater spending.  By the end of March 2007, almost a year before the first primary and more than 18 months before the general election, presidential candidates had already raised over $150 million.  See Balz, Fundraising Totals Challenge Early Campaign Assumptions, Washington Post, Apr. 17, 2007, p. A1 (citing figures and noting that &#x93;[t]he campaign is living up to its reputation as the most expensive in U. S. history&#x94;).  To reach this total, the leading fundraisers collected over $250,000 per day in the first quarter of 2007, Mullins, Clinton Leads the Money Race, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2007, p. A8, and the eventual nominees are expected to raise $500 million apiece (about $680,000 per day over a 2-year election cycle), Kirkpatrick and Pilhofer, McCain Lags in Income But Excels in Spending, Report Shows, N. Y. Times, Apr. 15, 2007, p. 20.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensability of these huge sums has two significant consequences for American Government that are particularly on point here.  The enormous demands, first, assign power to deep pockets.  See Balz, <em>supra</em>, at A6 (&#x93;For all the interest in Internet fundraising, big donors still ruled in the first quarter, with roughly 80 percent of donations coming in amounts of $1,000 or more&#x94;).  Candidates occasionally boast about the number of contributors they have, but the headlines speaking in dollars reflect political reality.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Mullins, <em>supra</em>, at A8 (headlined &#x93;Clinton Leads the Money Race&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Some major contributors get satisfaction from pitching in for their candidates, but political preference fails to account for the frequency of giving &#x93;substantial sums to <em>both</em> major national parties,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 148, a practice driven &#x93;by stark political pragmatism, not by ideological support for either party or their candidates,&#x94; Brief for Committee for Economic Development et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> in <em>McConnell</em>, O. T. 2003, No. 02&#x96;1674, p. 3 (hereinafter CED Brief).  What the high-dollar pragmatists of either variety get is special access to the officials they help elect, and with it a disproportionate influence on those in power.  See <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em/>at 130&#x96;131.  As the erstwhile officer of a large American corporation put it, &#x93; &#x91;[b]usiness leaders believe&#x97;based on experience and with good reason&#x97;that &#x2026; access gives them an opportunity to shape and affect governmental decisions and that their ability to do so derives from the fact that they have given large sums of money to the parties.&#x92; &#x94;  CED Brief 9.  At a critical level, contributions that underwrite elections are leverage for enormous political influence.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Voters know this.  Hence, the second important consequence of the demand for big money to finance publicity: pervasive public cynicism.  A 2002 poll found that 71 percent of Americans think Members of Congress cast votes based on the views of their big contributors, even when those views differ from the Member&#x92;s own beliefs about what is best for the country.  Mellman &amp; Wirthlin 267; see also <em>id.</em>, at 266 (&#x93;In public opinion research it is uncommon to have 70 percent or more of the public see an issue the same way.  When they do, it indicates an unusually strong agreement on that issue&#x94;).  The same percentage believes that the will of contributors tempts Members to vote against the majority view of their constituents.  <em>Id.</em>, at 267.  Almost half of Americans believe that Members often decide how to vote based on what big contributors to their party want, while only a quarter think Members often base their votes on perceptions of what is best for the country or their constituents.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Devoting concentrations of money in self-interested hands to the support of political campaigning therefore threatens the capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents and the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves.  These are the elements summed up in the notion of political integrity, giving it a value second to none in a free society.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the threat to this value flowing from concentrations of money in politics has reached an unprecedented enormity, it has been gathering force for generations.  Before the turn of the last century, as now, it was obvious that the purchase of influence and the cynicism of voters threaten the integrity and stability of democratic government, each derived from the responsiveness of its law to the interests of citizens and their confidence in that focus.  The danger has traditionally seemed at its apex when no reasonable limits constrain the campaign activities of organizations whose &#x93;unique legal and economic characteristics&#x94; are tailored to &#x93;facilitat[e] the amassing of large treasuries,&#x94; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Thirty years later, new questions about the electoral influence of accumulated wealth surfaced as organized labor expanded during the New Deal.  In the 1936 election, labor unions contributed &#x93;unprecedented&#x94; sums, S. Rep. No. 151, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 127 (1937), the greater part of them by the United Mine Workers, see Campaign Finance Sourcebook 17.  And in due course reaction began to build: &#x93;[w]artime strikes gave rise to fears of the new concentration of power represented by the gains of trade unionism.  And so the belief grew that, just as the great corporations had made huge political contributions to influence governmental action &#x2026; , the powerful unions were pursuing a similar course, and with the same untoward consequences for the democratic process.&#x94;  <em>Automobile Workers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 578.  Congress responded with the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943, which extended the ban on corporate donations to labor organizations, ch. 144, &#xA7;9, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">57</a>Stat.

        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At the same time, Congress had another worry that foreshadows our case today.  It was concerned that the statutory prohibition on corporate &#x93;contribution[s]&#x94; was being so narrowly construed as to open a &#x93;loophole whereby corporations, national banks, and labor organizations are enabled to avoid the obviously intended restrictive policy of the statute by garbing their financial assistance in the form of an &#x91;expenditure&#x92; rather than a contribution.&#x94;  S. Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38&#x96;39 (1947); see also H. Rep. No. 2739, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 40 (1947) (&#x93;The intent and purpose of the provision of the act prohibiting any corporation or labor organization making any contribution in connection with any election would be wholly defeated if it were assumed that the term &#x91;making any contribution&#x92; related only to the donating of money directly to a candidate, and excluded the vast expenditures of money in the activities herein shown to be engaged in extensively.  Of what avail would a law be to prohibit the contributing direct to a candidate and yet permit the expenditure of large sums in his behalf?&#x94;).

        <p class="bodytext">    The new law left open, however, the right of a union to spend money on electioneering from a segregated fund raised specifically for that purpose from members, but not drawn from the general treasury.  Segregated funding entities, the now-familiar political action committees or PACs, had been established prior to Taft-Hartley, and we concluded in <em>Pipefitters</em> v. <em>United States</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    In 1986, in <em>MCFL</em>, we reexamined the longstanding ban on spending corporate and union treasury funds &#x93;in connection with&#x94; federal elections, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/441b.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;441b</a>, and drew two conclusions implicated in the present case.  First, we construed the &#x93;in connection with&#x94; phrase in much the same way we had interpreted comparable FECA language challenged in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
<em>(per curiam)</em>.  We held that to avoid vagueness, the product of prohibited corporate and union expenditures &#x93;must constitute &#x91;express advocacy&#x92; in order to be subject to the prohibition.&#x94;  <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 249.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We thus held that the prohibition applied &#x93;only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 44.  &#x93;[E]xpress terms,&#x94; in turn, meant what had already become known as &#x93;magic words,&#x94; such as &#x93; &#x91;vote for,&#x92; &#x91;elect,&#x92; &#x91;support,&#x92; &#x91;cast your ballot for,&#x92; &#x91;Smith for Congress,&#x92; &#x91;vote against,&#x92; &#x91;defeat,&#x92; &#x91;reject.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>,<em/>n. 52.  The consequence of this construction was obvious: it pulled the teeth out of the statute, as we had understood when we announced it in its earlier application in Buckley:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness &#x2026; undermines the limitation&#x92;s effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or officeholder.  It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate&#x92;s campaign.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 45.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nor was the statute, even as thus narrowed, enforceable against the particular advocacy corporation challenging the limit in <em>MCFL</em>.  This was the second holding of <em>MCFL </em>relevant here;<em/>we explained that the congressional effort to limit the political influence of corporate money &#x93;has reflected concern not about use of the corporate form <em>per se</em>, but about the potential for unfair deployment of wealth for political purposes,&#x94; 479 U.

We held that this &#x93;legitima[te]&#x94; concern could not reasonably extend to electioneering expenditures by the corporation at issue in <em>MCFL</em>, which neither &#x93;engage[d] in business activities&#x94; nor accepted donations from business corporations and unions (and thus could not serve as a &#x93;condui[t]&#x94; for political spending by those entities).  <em>Id.</em>, at 263&#x96;264.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>McConnell</em>, we found this definition to be &#x93;easily understood and objectiv[e],&#x94; raising &#x93;none of the vagueness concerns that drove our analysis&#x94; of the statutory language at issue in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em>, 540 U.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  We rejected any suggestion &#x93;that <em>Buckley</em> drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy [with magic words] and so-called issue advocacy [without them], and that speakers possess an inviolable 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to engage in the latter category of speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 190.  To the contrary, we held that &#x93;our decisions in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em> were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 192&#x96;193.  &#x93;[T]he presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech,&#x94; which is prohibitable, &#x93;from a true issue ad,&#x94; we said, since ads that &#x93;esche[w] the use of magic words &#x2026; are no less clearly intended to influence the election.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 193.  We thus found &#x93;[l]ittle difference &#x2026; between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We understood that Congress had a compelling interest in limiting this sort of electioneering by corporations and unions, for &#xA7;203 exemplified a tradition of &#x93;repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U.

Nor did we see any plausible claim of substantial overbreadth from incidentally prohibiting ads genuinely focused on issues rather than elections, given the limitation of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; by time, geographical coverage, and clear reference to candidate.  &#x93;Far from establishing that BCRA&#x92;s application to pure issue ads is substantial, either in an absolute sense or relative to its application to election-related advertising, the record strongly supports the contrary conclusion.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 207.  Finally, we underscored the reasonableness of the &#xA7;203 line by emphasizing that it defined a category of limited, but not prohibited, corporate and union speech: &#x93;Because corporations can still fund electioneering communications with PAC money, it is &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression rather than a regulation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 204 (quoting <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em> v. <em>Beaumont</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    We may add that a nonprofit corporation, no matter what its source of funding, is free to pelt a federal candidate like Jane Doe with criticism or shower her with praise, by name and within days of an election, if it speaks through a newspaper ad or on a website, rather than a &#x93;broadcast, cable, or satellite communication,&#x94;

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, Congress in 1907 prohibited corporate contributions to candidates and in 1943 applied the same ban to unions.  In 1947, Congress extended the complete ban from contributions to expenditures &#x93;in connection with&#x94; an election, a phrase so vague that in 1986 we held it must be confined to instances of express advocacy using magic words.  Congress determined, in 2002, that corporate and union expenditures for fake issue ads devoid of magic words should be regulated using a narrow definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; to reach only broadcast ads that were the practical equivalents of express advocacy.  In 2003, this Court found the provision free from vagueness and justified by the concern that drove its enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This century-long tradition of legislation and judicial precedent rests on facing undeniable facts and testifies to an equally undeniable value.  Campaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries, with no redolence of &#x93;grassroots&#x94; about them.  Neither Congress&#x92;s decisions nor our own have understood the corrupting influence of money in politics as being limited to outright bribery or discrete <em>quid pro quo; </em>campaign finance reform has instead consistently focused on the more pervasive distortion of electoral institutions by concentrated wealth, on the special access and guaranteed favor that sap the representative integrity of American government and defy public confidence in its institutions.  From early in the 20th century through the decision in <em>McConnell</em>, we have acknowledged that the value of democratic integrity justifies a realistic response when corporations and labor organizations commit the concentrated moneys in their treasuries to electioneering.</p>

            </a>  In 2004, WRTL accepted over $315,000 in corporate donations, App. 40, and of its six general fund contributions of $50,000 or more between 2002 and 2005, three, including the largest (for $140,000), came from corporate donors, <em>id.</em>, at 118&#x96;121.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL also runs a PAC, funded by individual donations, which has been active over the years in making independent campaign expenditures, as in the previous two elections involving Senator Feingold.  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  During the 1998 campaign, for example, WRTL&#x92;s PAC spent $60,000 to oppose him.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In 2004, however, despite a sharp nationwide increase in PAC receipts, WRTL focused its fundraising on its corporate treasury, not the PAC, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;43, and took in only $17,000 in PAC contributions, as against over $150,000 during 2000, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;42.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Throughout the 2004 senatorial campaign, WRTL made no secret of its views about who should win the election and explicitly tied its position to the filibuster issue.  Its PAC issued at least two press releases saying that its &#x93;Top Election Priorities&#x94; were to &#x93;Re-elect George W. Bush&#x94; and &#x93;Send Feingold Packing!&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 78&#x96;80, 82&#x96;84.  In one of these, the Chair of WRTL&#x92;s PAC was quoted as saying, &#x93; &#x91;We do not want Russ Feingold to continue to have the ability to thwart President Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 82&#x96;83.  The Spring 2004 issue of the WRTL PAC&#x92;s quarterly magazine ran an article headlined &#x93;Radically Pro-Abortion Feingold Must Go!&#x94;, which reported that &#x93;Feingold has been active in his opposition to Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees&#x94; and said that &#x93;the defeat of Feingold must be uppermost in the minds of Wisconsin&#x92;s pro-life community in the 2004 elections.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 101&#x96;103.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    It was under these circumstances that WRTL ran the three television and radio ads in question.  The bills for them were not paid by WRTL&#x92;s PAC, but out of the general treasury with its substantial proportion of corporate contributions; in fact, corporations earmarked more than $50,000 specifically to pay for the ads, <em>id.</em>, at 41.  Each one criticized an unnamed &#x93;group of Senators&#x94; for &#x93;using the filibuster delay tactic to block federal judicial nominees from a simple &#x91;yes&#x92; or &#x91;no&#x92; vote,&#x94; and described the Senators&#x92; actions as &#x93;politics at work, causing gridlock and backing up some of our courts to a state of emergency.&#x94;<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>  They exhorted viewers and listeners to &#x93;[c]ontact Senators Feingold and Kohl and tell them to oppose the filibuster,&#x94; but instead of providing a phone number or e-mail address, they told the audience to go to BeFair.org, a website set up by WRTL.  A visit to this website would erase any doubt a listener or viewer might have as to whether Senators Feingold and Kohl were part of the &#x93;group&#x94; condemned in the ads: it displayed a document that criticized the two Senators for voting to filibuster &#x93;16 out of 16 times&#x94; and accused them of &#x93;putting politics into the court system, creating gridlock, and costing taxpayers money.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 86.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL&#x92;s planned airing of the ads had no apparent relation to any Senate filibuster vote but was keyed to the timing of the senatorial election.  WRTL began broadcasting the ads on July 26, 2004, four days after the Senate recessed for the summer, and although the filibuster controversy raged on through 2005, WRTL did not resume running the ads after the election.  <em>Id.</em>, at 29, 32.

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, any Wisconsin voter who paid attention would have known that Democratic Senator Feingold supported filibusters against Republican presidential judicial nominees, that the propriety of the filibusters was a major issue in the senatorial campaign, and that WRTL along with the Senator&#x92;s Republican challengers opposed his reelection because of his position on filibusters.  Any alert voters who heard or saw WRTL&#x92;s ads would have understood that WRTL was telling them that the Senator&#x92;s position on the filibusters should be grounds to vote against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given these facts, it is beyond all reasonable debate that the ads are constitutionally subject to regulation under <em>McConnell</em>.  There, we noted that BCRA was meant to remedy the problem of &#x93;[s]o-called issue ads&#x94; being used &#x93;to advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 126.  We then gave a paradigmatic example of these electioneering ads subject to regulation, saying that &#x93;[l]ittle difference existed . . . between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The WRTL ads were indistinguishable from the Jane Doe ad; they &#x93;condemned [Senator Feingold&#x92;s] record on a particular issue&#x94; and exhorted the public to contact him and &#x93;tell [him] what you think.&#x94;<a name="ZD-16ref" href="#ZD-16" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  And just as anyone who heard the Jane Doe ad would understand that the point was to defeat Doe, anyone who heard the Feingold ads (let alone anyone who went to the website they named) would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.  If it is now unconstitutional to restrict WRTL&#x92;s Feingold ads, then it follows that &#xA7;203 can no longer be applied constitutionally to <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>Jane Doe paradigm.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding that &#xA7;203 is facially constitutional is overruled.  By what steps does the principal opinion reach this unacknowledged result less than four years after <em>McConnell</em> was decided?</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, it lays down a new test to identify a severely limited class of ads that may constitutionally be regulated as electioneering communications, a test that is flatly contrary to <em>McConnell</em>.  An ad is the equivalent of express advocacy and subject to regulation, the opinion says, only if it is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Since the Feingold ads could, in isolation, be read as at least including calls to communicate views on filibusters to the two Senators, those ads cannot be treated as the functional equivalent of express advocacy to elect or defeat anyone, and therefore may not constitutionally be regulated at all.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the same could have been said of the hypothetical Jane Doe ad.  Its spoken message ended with the instruction to tell Doe what the voter thinks.  The same could also have been said of the actual Yellowtail ad.  Yet in <em>McConnell</em>, we gave the Jane Doe ad as the paradigm of a broadcast message that could be constitutionally regulated as election conduct, and we explicitly described the Yellowtail ad as a &#x93;striking example&#x94; of one that was &#x93;clearly intended to influence the election,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 193, and n. 78.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The principal opinion, in other words, simply inverts what we said in <em>McConnell</em>.  While we left open the possibility of a &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure&#x94; issue ad that might not be open to regulation under &#xA7;203, <em>id.</em>, at 206&#x96;207, and n. 88, we meant that an issue ad without campaign advocacy could escape the restriction.  The implication of the adjectives &#x93;genuine&#x94; and &#x93;pure&#x94; is unmistakable: if an ad is reasonably understood as going beyond a discussion of issues (that is, if it can be understood as electoral advocacy), then by definition it is not &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure.&#x94;  But the principal opinion inexplicably wrings the opposite conclusion from those words: if an ad is susceptible to any &#x93;reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; then it must be a &#x93;pure&#x94; or &#x93;genuine&#x94; issue ad.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  This stands <em>McConnell</em> on its head, and on this reasoning it is pos-<span class="softbreak"/>sible that even some ads with magic words could not be regulated.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Second, the principal opinion seems to defend this inversion of <em>McConnell</em> as a necessary alternative to an unadministrable subjective test for the equivalence of express (and regulable) electioneering advocacy.  The principal opinion acknowledges, of course, that in <em>McConnell</em> we said that &#x93;[t]he justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during [the period shortly before an election] if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;  540 U.

            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> were correct that <em>McConnell</em> made the constitutional application of &#xA7;203 contingent on whether a corporation&#x92;s &#x93;motives were pure,&#x94; or its issue advocacy &#x93;subjective[ly] sincer[e],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted), then I, too, might be inclined to reconsider <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s language.  But <em>McConnell</em> did not do that.  It did not purport to draw constitutional lines based on the subjective motivations of corporations (or their principals) sponsoring political ads, but merely described our test for equivalence to express advocacy as resting on the ads&#x92; &#x93;electioneering purpose,&#x94; which will be objectively apparent from those ads&#x92; content and context (as these cases and the examples cited in <em>McConnell </em>readily show).  We therefore held that &#xA7;203 was not substantially overbroad because &#x93;the vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose,&#x94; and consequently could be regulated consistent with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  540 U. S., at 206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, if the studies to which <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> refers were now to inform our reading of <em>McConnell</em>, they would merely underscore the objective character of the proper way to determine whether &#xA7;203 is constitutional as applied to a given ad.  The authors of those studies did not conduct discovery of the &#x93;actua[l] inten[tions],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14, behind any ads; nor, to my knowledge, were the sponsors of campaign ads summoned before researchers to explain their motivations.  The studies merely confirmed that &#x93;reasonable people are &#x2026; able to discern between ads whose primary purpose is to support a candidate and those intended to provide information about a policy issue.&#x94;  J. Krasno &amp; D. Seltz, Buying Time: Television Advertising in the 1998 Congressional Elections 9 (2000).  To be clear, I am not endorsing the precise methodology of those studies (and <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> is correct that we did not do so in <em>McConnell</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13, n. 4); the point is only that the studies relied on a &#x93;reasonable&#x94; person&#x92;s understanding of the ads&#x92; apparent purpose, and thus were no less objective than <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s own approach.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A similarly mistaken fear of an unadministrable and speech-chilling subjective regime seems to underlie <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice&#x92;</span>s unwillingness to acknowledge the part that consideration of an ad&#x92;s context necessarily plays in any realistic assessment of its meaning.  A reasonable Wisconsinite watching or listening to WRTL&#x92;s ads would likely ask and answer some obvious questions about their circumstances.  Is the group that sponsors these ads the same one publicly campaigning against Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection?  <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> says that this information is &#x93;beside the point,&#x94; because WRTL&#x92;s history of overt electioneering only &#x93;goes to [its] subjective intent.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Did these &#x93;issue&#x94; ads begin appearing on the air during the election season, rather than at the time the filibuster &#x93;issue&#x94; was in fact being debated in the Senate?  This, too, is said to be irrelevant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  And does the website to which WRTL&#x92;s ads direct viewers contain material expressly advocating Senator Feingold&#x92;s defeat?  This enquiry is dismissed as being &#x93;one step removed from the text of the ads themselves.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  But these questions are central to the meaning of the ads, and any reasonable person would take account of circumstances in coming to understand the object of WRTL&#x92;s ad.  And why not?  Each of the contextual facts here can be established by an objective look at a public record; none requires a voter (or a litigant) to engage in discovery of evidence about WRTL&#x92;s operations or internal communications, and none goes to a hidden state of mind.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This refusal to see and hear what any listener to WRTL&#x92;s ads would actually consider produces a rule no different in practice from the one adopted by the District Court, which declined to look beyond the &#x93;four corners&#x94; of the ads themselves.  466 F. Supp. 2d 195, 207 (DC 2006).  Although <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> ostensibly stops short of categorically foreclosing consideration of context, see <em>ante</em>, at 20, the application of his test here makes it difficult to see how relevant contextual evidence could ever be taken into account the way it was in <em>McConnell</em>,<a name="ZD-19ref" href="#ZD-19" class="">

            </a> and it is hard to imagine <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> would ever find an ad to be &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16, unless it contained words of express advocacy.  <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> thus effectively reinstates the same toothless &#x93;magic words&#x94; criterion of regulable electioneering that led Congress to enact BCRA in the first place.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Third, it may be that the principal opinion rejects <em>McConnell </em>on the erroneous assumption that &#xA7;203 flatly bans independent electioneering communications by a corporation.  <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> argues that corporations must receive &#x93;the benefit of any doubt,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16,<em/>whenever we undertake the task of &#x93;separating &#x2026; political speech protected under the

But this is a fundamental misconception of the task at hand:  we have already held that it is &#x93; &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression,&#x94; because PAC financing provides corporations &#x93;with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy.&#x94;<a name="ZD-20ref" href="#ZD-20" class="">

            <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 203&#x96;204 (quoting <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 162).  Thus, a successful as-applied challenger to &#xA7;203 should necessarily show, at the least, that it could not constitutionally be subjected to the administrative rules that govern a PAC&#x92;s formation and operation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 163.  This would be an uphill fight, after our repeated affirmations that the PAC structure does not impose excessive burdens, <em>ibid.</em> (citing <em>National Right to Work Comm.</em>, 459 U. S., at 201&#x96;202), and WRTL has a particularly weak position on this point: it set up its own PAC long before the 2004 election, used it to campaign openly against Senator Feingold in the past, and could have raised noncorporate donations to it in the 2004 election cycle.  Any argument that establishing and maintaining a PAC is unconstitutionally burdensome for WRTL would thus likely be futile, and certainly should not prevail on WRTL&#x92;s summary judgment motion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, even without the PAC alternative, it would be untrue that &#xA7;203 &#x93;banned&#x94; WRTL from saying anything a genuine issue ad would say, for WRTL could have availed itself of either or both of the following additional options.  It is undisputed that WRTL&#x92;s ads could have been broadcast lawfully in the runup to the election (and bankrolled from WRTL&#x92;s general treasury) if Senator Feingold&#x92;s name had been omitted and the Senator not otherwise singled out.  Since members of today&#x92;s majority apparently view WRTL&#x92;s broadcasts either as &#x93;genuine issue ad[s],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16 (opinion of <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>), or as &#x93;lobby[ing] Wisconsin voters concerning the filibustering of the President&#x92;s judicial nominees,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 2 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.,</span> concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a claim that omitting Senator Feingold&#x92;s name would &#x93;ban&#x94; WRTL&#x92;s message is specious.  Yet one searches my Brothers&#x92; opinions in vain for any persuasive reason why substituting the phrase &#x93;Contact your Senators&#x94; for the phrase &#x93;Contact Senators Feingold and Kohl&#x94; would have denied WRTL a constitutionally sufficient (and clearly lawful) alternative way to send its message.  If WRTL is to be believed when it claims that the issue was the point of the ads, it would have lost nothing by referring simply to the &#x93;Senators.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the suggestion that &#xA7;203 is a ban on political speech is belied by <em>MCFL</em>&#x92;s safe harbor for nonprofit advocacy corporations: under that rule, WRTL would have been free to attack Senator Feingold by name at any time with ads funded from its corporate treasury, if it had not also chosen to serve as a funnel for hundreds of thousands of dollars from other corporations.  Thus, what is called a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech is a limit on the financing of electioneering broadcasts by entities that refuse to take advantage of the PAC structure but insist on acting as conduits from the campaign war chests of business corporations.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, <em>McConnell</em> does not graft a subjective standard onto campaign regulation, the context of campaign advertising cannot sensibly be ignored, and &#xA7;203 is not a ban on speech.  What cannot be gainsaid, in any event, is that in treating these subjects as it does, the operative opinion produces the result of overruling <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding on &#xA7;203, less than four years in the Reports.  Anyone who doubts that need merely ask what the law would have been if, back in 2003, this Court had held &#xA7;203 facially unconstitutional.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    BCRA&#x92;s definition of &#x93;electioneering communication,&#x94; which identifies the communications regulable under &#xA7;203, includes a backup to be used if the primary definition &#x93;is held to be constitutionally insufficient by final judicial decision to support the regulation provided herein.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_A_ii" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(A)(ii)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If this should occur, &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; is to be defined as </p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This backup sounds familiar because it is essentially identical to <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s test for evaluating an as-applied challenge to the original definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94;: regulation is permissible only if the communication is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16.  Thus does the principal opinion institute the very standard that would have prevailed if the Court formally overruled <em>McConnell</em>.  There is neither a theoretical nor a practical basis to claim that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s treatment of &#xA7;203 survives.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">E</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The price of <em>McConnell&#x92;</em>s<em/>demise as authority on &#xA7;203 seems to me to be a high one.  The Court (and, I think, the country) loses when important precedent is overruled without good reason, and there is no justification for departing from our usual rule of <em>stare decisis</em> here.  The same combination of alternatives that was available to corporations affected by <em>McConnell</em> in 2003 is available today: WRTL could have run a newspaper ad, could have paid for the broadcast ads through its PAC, could have established itself as an <em>MCFL</em> organization free of corporate money, and could have said &#x93;call your Senators&#x94; instead of naming Senator Feingold in its ads broadcasted just before the election.  Nothing in the related law surrounding &#xA7;203 has changed in any way, let alone in any way that undermines <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>rationale.  See <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Nor can any serious argument be made that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding has been &#x93;unworkable in practice.&#x94;  <em>Allied-Signal, Inc.</em> v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, it goes without saying that nothing has changed about the facts.  In Justice Frankfurter&#x92;s words, they demonstrate a threat to &#x93;the integrity of our electoral process,&#x94; <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 570, which for a century now Congress has repeatedly found to be imperiled by corporate, and later union, money: witness the Tillman Act, Taft-Hartley, FECA, and BCRA.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  <em>McConnell </em>was our latest decision vindicating clear and reasonable boundaries that Congress has drawn to limit &#x93; &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth,&#x92; &#x94; 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660), and the decision could claim the justification of ongoing fact as well as decisional history in recognizing Congress&#x92;s authority to protect the integrity of elections from the distortion of corporate and union funds.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After today, the ban on contributions by corporations and unions and the limitation on their corrosive spending when they enter the political arena are open to easy circumvention, and the possibilities for regulating corporate and union campaign money are unclear.  The ban on contributions will mean nothing much, now that companies and unions can save candidates the expense of advertising directly, simply by running &#x93;issue ads&#x94; without express advocacy, or by funneling the money through an independent corporation like WRTL.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the understanding of the voters and the Congress that this kind of corporate and union spending seriously jeopardizes the integrity of democratic government will remain.  The facts are too powerful to be ignored, and further efforts at campaign finance reform will come.  It is only the legal landscape that now is altered, and it may be that today&#x92;s departure from precedent will drive further reexamination of the constitutional analysis: of the distinction between contributions and expenditures, or the relation between spending and speech, which have given structure to our thinking since <em>Buckley</em> itself was decided.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    I cannot tell what the future will force upon us, but I respectfully dissent from this judgment today.</p>

Bellotti, however, concerned corporate spending in connection with a referendum, and we went out of our way in that case to avoid casting any doubt upon the constitutionality of limiting corporate expenditures during candidate elections.  We said:


&#x93;The overriding concern behind the enactment of [the federal restrictions on corporate contributions and expenditures] was the problem of corruption of elected representatives through the creation of political debts.  The importance of the governmental interest in preventing this occurrence has never been doubted.  The case before us presents no comparable problem, and our consideration of a corporation&#x92;s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.  Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.&#x94;  435 U.

S., at 259, n. 12.  So Austin did not &#x93;stra[y]&#x94; from Bellotti, ante, at 7 (opinion of Scalia, J.); the reasons Bellotti was not controlling in Austin had been clearly foreshadowed in Bellotti itself and confirmed repeatedly in our decisions leading up to Austin.

&#x93;Especially beginning in 1996, issue advocacy during the campaign season dramatically expanded in Wisconsin.
.....


&#x93;The Commission concludes that, in each of these cases, the expenditures were clearly campaign-oriented activities.  They were quite clearly designed to influence the electoral process.  They were focused either on electing or defeating a candidate.  The Commission bases this conclusion on the following points:


&#x93;Although those paying for the activities claimed they were aimed solely at educating voters on the issues, they each mentioned the names of candidates for office.


&#x93;They occurred only when election races were in progress that involved a contest between an incumbent and a challenger.  When the election was over, the activities ended.


&#x93;The activity has occurred after legislative sessions when the issues about which advocacy was occurring were not being deliberated by the legislature.


&#x93;The activity occurred in campaign season, between the candidate&#x92;s filing for candidacy and election time.  Advertisements of this sort have tended to occur at virtually no other time.


&#x93;The activity involved the electronic media, mass mailings, or centrally located telephone banks.
.....


&#x93;The explosive growth of campaign-based advocacy, without even disclosure of its activities and funding sources, poses a grave risk to the integrity of elections. It has created a two-tiered campaign process: one, based in candidates and political parties, which is tightly regulated and controlled; the other, based in interest group activity under the guise of &#x91;issue advocacy&#x92; but actually quite clearly election-focused, which lies beyond accountability.&#x94;  1 Governor&#x92;s Blue-Ribbon Commission on Campaign Finance Reform, State of Wisconsin: Report of the Commission, available at http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
 (per curiam), &#x93;already rejected&#x94; any test that calls for an assessment of the intent and effect of corporate electioneering.  Ante, at 13.  The &#x93;reject[ion]&#x94; to which The Chief Justice presumably refers is Buckley&#x92;s quotation of Thomas v. Collins, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/516" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 516</a> (1945)
, where we found impermissibly vague a statute that permitted a union leader to &#x93; &#x91;laud unionism&#x92; &#x94; but forbade him to &#x93;imply an invitation&#x94; to join a union.  Id., at 534.  The problem with this predicament, we reasoned, was the lack of a clearly permissible opportunity for expression:  Whether words &#x93;designed to fall short of invitation would miss that mark is a question both of intent and of effect,&#x94; and no speaker &#x93;safely could assume that anything he might say &#x2026; would not be understood by some as an invitation.&#x94;  Id., at 535.  We then specified that the speaker in Thomas was left with an impermissibly limited universe of &#x93;three choices: (1) to stand on his right and speak freely; (2) to quit, refusing entirely to speak; (3) to trim, and even thus to risk the penalty.&#x94;  Id., at 536.


The Chief Justice implies that considering the intent and effect of corporate advertising during as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203 would put corporations in precisely the same bind; thus, he wonders how McConnell could use the language of intent and effect without &#x93;even address[ing] what Buckley&#x94; (and by extension, Thomas) &#x93;had to say on the subject.&#x94;  Ante, at 14.  But one need not look far in our McConnell opinion to understand why we thought that corporations have more than the constrained set of options available to the union leader in Thomas.  Just a few sentences after holding that ads with electioneering intent and effect are regulable, we gave this explanation: &#x93;in the future corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads [shortly before an election] by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.  In other words, corporations can find refuge in constitutionally sufficient and clearly delineated safe harbors by modifying the content of their ads (by omitting a candidate&#x92;s name) or by altering the sources of their ads&#x92; financing (from general treasuries to PACs).  The Chief Justice thus wrongly jettisons our conclusions about the constitutionality of regulating ads with electioneering purpose; we meant what we said in McConnell, and we did not overlook 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence when we said it.  Whereas The Chief Justice says that BCRA &#x93;should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights,&#x94; ante, at 14, we already held in McConnell that the campaign finance law accomplishes precisely that.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-18" href="#ZD-18ref">18</a> The Chief Justice speculates that McConnell derived its test for functional equivalence from &#x93;[t]wo key studies,&#x94; ante, at 12, but not a shred of language in McConnell supports that theory.  In stating the legal standard, McConnell made no mention of any study.  What is the authority, then, for asserting that the studies were pivotal to the standard we announced in McConnell?  See ante, at 12.  Other than WRTL&#x92;s brief, The Chief Justice cites only Judge Henderson&#x92;s separate district court opinion in McConnell.  Ante, at 12.  But The Chief Justice quotes one part of Judge Henderson&#x92;s analysis and neglects to mention that she in turn was quoting the lead author of one of the studies in question: &#x93;According to the Brennan Center, the Buying Time reports were &#x91;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of&#x92; BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions &#x91;in support of their constitutional validity.&#x92; &#x94;  McConnell, 251 F.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-19" href="#ZD-19ref">19</a> Like the District Court, the only bit of context The Chief Justice would allow the reasonable listener is the congressional agenda: whether the &#x93; &#x91;issue&#x92; &#x94; addressed in an ad currently is, or soon will be, &#x93; &#x91;the subject of legislative scrutiny.&#x92; &#x94;  Ante, at 20 (quoting 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 207).  For example, The Chief Justice says, there would have been &#x93;no reason&#x94; to think that WRTL&#x92;s ad constituted anything but a pure issue ad if it addressed a bill pending during Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection campaign, such as the Universal National Service Act.  Ante, at 17.  It is revealing, of course, that The Chief Justice does not invoke the filibuster issue, the subject of WRTL&#x92;s ads, as the legislative matter with particular salience during the 2004 election.  But why the reasonable listener can look to Congress but not the calendar on the wall or a WRTL website is difficult to fathom.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-20" href="#ZD-20ref">20</a>Justice Scalia also adopts the same misconception that &#xA7;203 is a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech.  See ante, at 18 (&#x93;Section 203&#x92;s line is bright, but it bans vast amounts of political advocacy indistinguishable from hitherto protected speech&#x94;).
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-21" href="#ZD-21ref">21</a> These as-applied challenges provide no reason to second-guess our conclusion in McConnell that the rule for differentiating between electioneering ads and genuine issue ads is administrable.  WRTL&#x92;s ads clearly have an electioneering purpose and, as explained above, fall comfortably within the heartland of electioneering communications that &#xA7;203 may validly regulate.  Thus, although Justice Scalia claims that &#x93;[t]oday&#x92;s cases make it apparent&#x94; that McConnell must be overruled, ante, at 18, there is nothing about today&#x92;s cases that suggests that McConnell is unworkable.  We therefore have no occasion to reconsider McConnell from first principles.

        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensable ingredient of a political candidacy is money for advertising.  In the 2004 campaign, more than half of the combined expenditures by the two principal presidential candidates (excluding fundraising) went for media time and space.  See The Costliest Campaign, Washington Post, Dec. 30, 2004, p. A7.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>2</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And in the 2005&#x96;2006 election cycle, the expenditure of more than $2 billion on television shattered the previous record, even without a presidential contest.  See Inside Media, MediaWeek, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 18.  The portent is for still greater spending.  By the end of March 2007, almost a year before the first primary and more than 18 months before the general election, presidential candidates had already raised over $150 million.  See Balz, Fundraising Totals Challenge Early Campaign Assumptions, Washington Post, Apr. 17, 2007, p. A1 (citing figures and noting that &#x93;[t]he campaign is living up to its reputation as the most expensive in U. S. history&#x94;).  To reach this total, the leading fundraisers collected over $250,000 per day in the first quarter of 2007, Mullins, Clinton Leads the Money Race, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2007, p. A8, and the eventual nominees are expected to raise $500 million apiece (about $680,000 per day over a 2-year election cycle), Kirkpatrick and Pilhofer, McCain Lags in Income But Excels in Spending, Report Shows, N. Y. Times, Apr. 15, 2007, p. 20.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensability of these huge sums has two significant consequences for American Government that are particularly on point here.  The enormous demands, first, assign power to deep pockets.  See Balz, <em>supra</em>, at A6 (&#x93;For all the interest in Internet fundraising, big donors still ruled in the first quarter, with roughly 80 percent of donations coming in amounts of $1,000 or more&#x94;).  Candidates occasionally boast about the number of contributors they have, but the headlines speaking in dollars reflect political reality.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Mullins, <em>supra</em>, at A8 (headlined &#x93;Clinton Leads the Money Race&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Some major contributors get satisfaction from pitching in for their candidates, but political preference fails to account for the frequency of giving &#x93;substantial sums to <em>both</em> major national parties,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 148, a practice driven &#x93;by stark political pragmatism, not by ideological support for either party or their candidates,&#x94; Brief for Committee for Economic Development et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> in <em>McConnell</em>, O. T. 2003, No. 02&#x96;1674, p. 3 (hereinafter CED Brief).  What the high-dollar pragmatists of either variety get is special access to the officials they help elect, and with it a disproportionate influence on those in power.  See <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em/>at 130&#x96;131.  As the erstwhile officer of a large American corporation put it, &#x93; &#x91;[b]usiness leaders believe&#x97;based on experience and with good reason&#x97;that &#x2026; access gives them an opportunity to shape and affect governmental decisions and that their ability to do so derives from the fact that they have given large sums of money to the parties.&#x92; &#x94;  CED Brief 9.  At a critical level, contributions that underwrite elections are leverage for enormous political influence.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Voters know this.  Hence, the second important consequence of the demand for big money to finance publicity: pervasive public cynicism.  A 2002 poll found that 71 percent of Americans think Members of Congress cast votes based on the views of their big contributors, even when those views differ from the Member&#x92;s own beliefs about what is best for the country.  Mellman &amp; Wirthlin 267; see also <em>id.</em>, at 266 (&#x93;In public opinion research it is uncommon to have 70 percent or more of the public see an issue the same way.  When they do, it indicates an unusually strong agreement on that issue&#x94;).  The same percentage believes that the will of contributors tempts Members to vote against the majority view of their constituents.  <em>Id.</em>, at 267.  Almost half of Americans believe that Members often decide how to vote based on what big contributors to their party want, while only a quarter think Members often base their votes on perceptions of what is best for the country or their constituents.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Devoting concentrations of money in self-interested hands to the support of political campaigning therefore threatens the capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents and the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves.  These are the elements summed up in the notion of political integrity, giving it a value second to none in a free society.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the threat to this value flowing from concentrations of money in politics has reached an unprecedented enormity, it has been gathering force for generations.  Before the turn of the last century, as now, it was obvious that the purchase of influence and the cynicism of voters threaten the integrity and stability of democratic government, each derived from the responsiveness of its law to the interests of citizens and their confidence in that focus.  The danger has traditionally seemed at its apex when no reasonable limits constrain the campaign activities of organizations whose &#x93;unique legal and economic characteristics&#x94; are tailored to &#x93;facilitat[e] the amassing of large treasuries,&#x94; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Thirty years later, new questions about the electoral influence of accumulated wealth surfaced as organized labor expanded during the New Deal.  In the 1936 election, labor unions contributed &#x93;unprecedented&#x94; sums, S. Rep. No. 151, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 127 (1937), the greater part of them by the United Mine Workers, see Campaign Finance Sourcebook 17.  And in due course reaction began to build: &#x93;[w]artime strikes gave rise to fears of the new concentration of power represented by the gains of trade unionism.  And so the belief grew that, just as the great corporations had made huge political contributions to influence governmental action &#x2026; , the powerful unions were pursuing a similar course, and with the same untoward consequences for the democratic process.&#x94;  <em>Automobile Workers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 578.  Congress responded with the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943, which extended the ban on corporate donations to labor organizations, ch. 144, &#xA7;9,

        <p class="bodytext">    At the same time, Congress had another worry that foreshadows our case today.  It was concerned that the statutory prohibition on corporate &#x93;contribution[s]&#x94; was being so narrowly construed as to open a &#x93;loophole whereby corporations, national banks, and labor organizations are enabled to avoid the obviously intended restrictive policy of the statute by garbing their financial assistance in the form of an &#x91;expenditure&#x92; rather than a contribution.&#x94;  S. Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38&#x96;39 (1947); see also H. Rep. No. 2739, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 40 (1947) (&#x93;The intent and purpose of the provision of the act prohibiting any corporation or labor organization making any contribution in connection with any election would be wholly defeated if it were assumed that the term &#x91;making any contribution&#x92; related only to the donating of money directly to a candidate, and excluded the vast expenditures of money in the activities herein shown to be engaged in extensively.  Of what avail would a law be to prohibit the contributing direct to a candidate and yet permit the expenditure of large sums in his behalf?&#x94;).

        <p class="bodytext">    We thus held that the prohibition applied &#x93;only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U.

        <p class="bodytext">    An issue ad is an advertisement on a political subject urging the reader or listener to let a politician know what he thinks, but containing no magic words telling the recipient to vote for or against anyone.

Experience showed, however, just what we foresaw in <em>Buckley</em>, that the line between &#x93;issue&#x94; broadcasts and outright electioneering was a patent fiction, as in the example of a television &#x93;issue ad&#x94; that ran during a Montana congressional race between Republican Rick Hill and Democrat Bill Yellowtail in 1996:</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>McConnell</em>, we found this definition to be &#x93;easily understood and objectiv[e],&#x94; raising &#x93;none of the vagueness concerns that drove our analysis&#x94; of the statutory language at issue in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em>, 540 U.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  We rejected any suggestion &#x93;that <em>Buckley</em> drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy [with magic words] and so-called issue advocacy [without them], and that speakers possess an inviolable 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to engage in the latter category of speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 190.  To the contrary, we held that &#x93;our decisions in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em> were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 192&#x96;193.  &#x93;[T]he presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech,&#x94; which is prohibitable, &#x93;from a true issue ad,&#x94; we said, since ads that &#x93;esche[w] the use of magic words &#x2026; are no less clearly intended to influence the election.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 193.  We thus found &#x93;[l]ittle difference &#x2026; between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We understood that Congress had a compelling interest in limiting this sort of electioneering by corporations and unions, for &#xA7;203 exemplified a tradition of &#x93;repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660).  Nor did we see any plausible claim of substantial overbreadth from incidentally prohibiting ads genuinely focused on issues rather than elections, given the limitation of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; by time, geographical coverage, and clear reference to candidate.  &#x93;Far from establishing that BCRA&#x92;s application to pure issue ads is substantial, either in an absolute sense or relative to its application to election-related advertising, the record strongly supports the contrary conclusion.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 207.  Finally, we underscored the reasonableness of the &#xA7;203 line by emphasizing that it defined a category of limited, but not prohibited, corporate and union speech: &#x93;Because corporations can still fund electioneering communications with PAC money, it is &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression rather than a regulation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 204 (quoting <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em> v. <em>Beaumont</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    We may add that a nonprofit corporation, no matter what its source of funding, is free to pelt a federal candidate like Jane Doe with criticism or shower her with praise, by name and within days of an election, if it speaks through a newspaper ad or on a website, rather than a &#x93;broadcast, cable, or satellite communication,&#x94;

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, Congress in 1907 prohibited corporate contributions to candidates and in 1943 applied the same ban to unions.  In 1947, Congress extended the complete ban from contributions to expenditures &#x93;in connection with&#x94; an election, a phrase so vague that in 1986 we held it must be confined to instances of express advocacy using magic words.  Congress determined, in 2002, that corporate and union expenditures for fake issue ads devoid of magic words should be regulated using a narrow definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; to reach only broadcast ads that were the practical equivalents of express advocacy.  In 2003, this Court found the provision free from vagueness and justified by the concern that drove its enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This century-long tradition of legislation and judicial precedent rests on facing undeniable facts and testifies to an equally undeniable value.  Campaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries, with no redolence of &#x93;grassroots&#x94; about them.  Neither Congress&#x92;s decisions nor our own have understood the corrupting influence of money in politics as being limited to outright bribery or discrete <em>quid pro quo; </em>campaign finance reform has instead consistently focused on the more pervasive distortion of electoral institutions by concentrated wealth, on the special access and guaranteed favor that sap the representative integrity of American government and defy public confidence in its institutions.  From early in the 20th century through the decision in <em>McConnell</em>, we have acknowledged that the value of democratic integrity justifies a realistic response when corporations and labor organizations commit the concentrated moneys in their treasuries to electioneering.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Throughout the 2004 senatorial campaign, WRTL made no secret of its views about who should win the election and explicitly tied its position to the filibuster issue.  Its PAC issued at least two press releases saying that its &#x93;Top Election Priorities&#x94; were to &#x93;Re-elect George W. Bush&#x94; and &#x93;Send Feingold Packing!&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 78&#x96;80, 82&#x96;84.  In one of these, the Chair of WRTL&#x92;s PAC was quoted as saying, &#x93; &#x91;We do not want Russ Feingold to continue to have the ability to thwart President Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 82&#x96;83.  The Spring 2004 issue of the WRTL PAC&#x92;s quarterly magazine ran an article headlined &#x93;Radically Pro-Abortion Feingold Must Go!&#x94;, which reported that &#x93;Feingold has been active in his opposition to Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees&#x94; and said that &#x93;the defeat of Feingold must be uppermost in the minds of Wisconsin&#x92;s pro-life community in the 2004 elections.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 101&#x96;103.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    It was under these circumstances that WRTL ran the three television and radio ads in question.  The bills for them were not paid by WRTL&#x92;s PAC, but out of the general treasury with its substantial proportion of corporate contributions; in fact, corporations earmarked more than $50,000 specifically to pay for the ads, <em>id.</em>, at 41.  Each one criticized an unnamed &#x93;group of Senators&#x94; for &#x93;using the filibuster delay tactic to block federal judicial nominees from a simple &#x91;yes&#x92; or &#x91;no&#x92; vote,&#x94; and described the Senators&#x92; actions as &#x93;politics at work, causing gridlock and backing up some of our courts to a state of emergency.&#x94;<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>  They exhorted viewers and listeners to &#x93;[c]ontact Senators Feingold and Kohl and tell them to oppose the filibuster,&#x94; but instead of providing a phone number or e-mail address, they told the audience to go to BeFair.org, a website set up by WRTL.  A visit to this website would erase any doubt a listener or viewer might have as to whether Senators Feingold and Kohl were part of the &#x93;group&#x94; condemned in the ads: it displayed a document that criticized the two Senators for voting to filibuster &#x93;16 out of 16 times&#x94; and accused them of &#x93;putting politics into the court system, creating gridlock, and costing taxpayers money.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 86.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL&#x92;s planned airing of the ads had no apparent relation to any Senate filibuster vote but was keyed to the timing of the senatorial election.  WRTL began broadcasting the ads on July 26, 2004, four days after the Senate recessed for the summer, and although the filibuster controversy raged on through 2005, WRTL did not resume running the ads after the election.  <em>Id.</em>, at 29, 32.  During the campaign period that the ads did cover, Senator Feingold&#x92;s support of the filibusters was a prominent issue.  His position was well known,<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">
                <sup>

            </a> and his Republican opponents, who vocally opposed the filibusters, made the issue a major talking point in their campaigns against him.<a name="ZD-15ref" href="#ZD-15" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, any Wisconsin voter who paid attention would have known that Democratic Senator Feingold supported filibusters against Republican presidential judicial nominees, that the propriety of the filibusters was a major issue in the senatorial campaign, and that WRTL along with the Senator&#x92;s Republican challengers opposed his reelection because of his position on filibusters.  Any alert voters who heard or saw WRTL&#x92;s ads would have understood that WRTL was telling them that the Senator&#x92;s position on the filibusters should be grounds to vote against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given these facts, it is beyond all reasonable debate that the ads are constitutionally subject to regulation under <em>McConnell</em>.  There, we noted that BCRA was meant to remedy the problem of &#x93;[s]o-called issue ads&#x94; being used &#x93;to advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 126.  We then gave a paradigmatic example of these electioneering ads subject to regulation, saying that &#x93;[l]ittle difference existed . . . between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The WRTL ads were indistinguishable from the Jane Doe ad; they &#x93;condemned [Senator Feingold&#x92;s] record on a particular issue&#x94; and exhorted the public to contact him and &#x93;tell [him] what you think.&#x94;<a name="ZD-16ref" href="#ZD-16" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>16</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And just as anyone who heard the Jane Doe ad would understand that the point was to defeat Doe, anyone who heard the Feingold ads (let alone anyone who went to the website they named) would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.  If it is now unconstitutional to restrict WRTL&#x92;s Feingold ads, then it follows that &#xA7;203 can no longer be applied constitutionally to <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>Jane Doe paradigm.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding that &#xA7;203 is facially constitutional is overruled.  By what steps does the principal opinion reach this unacknowledged result less than four years after <em>McConnell</em> was decided?</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, it lays down a new test to identify a severely limited class of ads that may constitutionally be regulated as electioneering communications, a test that is flatly contrary to <em>McConnell</em>.  An ad is the equivalent of express advocacy and subject to regulation, the opinion says, only if it is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Since the Feingold ads could, in isolation, be read as at least including calls to communicate views on filibusters to the two Senators, those ads cannot be treated as the functional equivalent of express advocacy to elect or defeat anyone, and therefore may not constitutionally be regulated at all.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the same could have been said of the hypothetical Jane Doe ad.  Its spoken message ended with the instruction to tell Doe what the voter thinks.  The same could also have been said of the actual Yellowtail ad.  Yet in <em>McConnell</em>, we gave the Jane Doe ad as the paradigm of a broadcast message that could be constitutionally regulated as election conduct, and we explicitly described the Yellowtail ad as a &#x93;striking example&#x94; of one that was &#x93;clearly intended to influence the election,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 193, and n. 78.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The principal opinion, in other words, simply inverts what we said in <em>McConnell</em>.  While we left open the possibility of a &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure&#x94; issue ad that might not be open to regulation under &#xA7;203, <em>id.</em>, at 206&#x96;207, and n. 88, we meant that an issue ad without campaign advocacy could escape the restriction.  The implication of the adjectives &#x93;genuine&#x94; and &#x93;pure&#x94; is unmistakable: if an ad is reasonably understood as going beyond a discussion of issues (that is, if it can be understood as electoral advocacy), then by definition it is not &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure.&#x94;  But the principal opinion inexplicably wrings the opposite conclusion from those words: if an ad is susceptible to any &#x93;reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; then it must be a &#x93;pure&#x94; or &#x93;genuine&#x94; issue ad.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  This stands <em>McConnell</em> on its head, and on this reasoning it is pos-<span class="softbreak"/>sible that even some ads with magic words could not be regulated.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Second, the principal opinion seems to defend this inversion of <em>McConnell</em> as a necessary alternative to an unadministrable subjective test for the equivalence of express (and regulable) electioneering advocacy.  The principal opinion acknowledges, of course, that in <em>McConnell</em> we said that &#x93;[t]he justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during [the period shortly before an election] if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.  But <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> says that statement in <em>McConnell</em> cannot be accepted at face value because we could not, consistent with precedent, have focused our 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> enquiry on whether &#x93;the speaker actually intended to affect an election.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.<a name="ZD-17ref" href="#ZD-17" class="">

            <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> suggests it is more likely that the <em>McConnell</em> opinion inadvertently borrowed the language of &#x93;intended &#x2026; effect[s],&#x94; 540 U.

        <p class="bodytext">    If <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> were correct that <em>McConnell</em> made the constitutional application of &#xA7;203 contingent on whether a corporation&#x92;s &#x93;motives were pure,&#x94; or its issue advocacy &#x93;subjective[ly] sincer[e],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted), then I, too, might be inclined to reconsider <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s language.  But <em>McConnell</em> did not do that.  It did not purport to draw constitutional lines based on the subjective motivations of corporations (or their principals) sponsoring political ads, but merely described our test for equivalence to express advocacy as resting on the ads&#x92; &#x93;electioneering purpose,&#x94; which will be objectively apparent from those ads&#x92; content and context (as these cases and the examples cited in <em>McConnell </em>readily show).  We therefore held that &#xA7;203 was not substantially overbroad because &#x93;the vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose,&#x94; and consequently could be regulated consistent with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  540 U. S., at 206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, if the studies to which <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> refers were now to inform our reading of <em>McConnell</em>, they would merely underscore the objective character of the proper way to determine whether &#xA7;203 is constitutional as applied to a given ad.  The authors of those studies did not conduct discovery of the &#x93;actua[l] inten[tions],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14, behind any ads; nor, to my knowledge, were the sponsors of campaign ads summoned before researchers to explain their motivations.  The studies merely confirmed that &#x93;reasonable people are &#x2026; able to discern between ads whose primary purpose is to support a candidate and those intended to provide information about a policy issue.&#x94;  J. Krasno &amp; D. Seltz, Buying Time: Television Advertising in the 1998 Congressional Elections 9 (2000).  To be clear, I am not endorsing the precise methodology of those studies (and <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> is correct that we did not do so in <em>McConnell</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13, n. 4); the point is only that the studies relied on a &#x93;reasonable&#x94; person&#x92;s understanding of the ads&#x92; apparent purpose, and thus were no less objective than <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s own approach.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A similarly mistaken fear of an unadministrable and speech-chilling subjective regime seems to underlie <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice&#x92;</span>s unwillingness to acknowledge the part that consideration of an ad&#x92;s context necessarily plays in any realistic assessment of its meaning.  A reasonable Wisconsinite watching or listening to WRTL&#x92;s ads would likely ask and answer some obvious questions about their circumstances.  Is the group that sponsors these ads the same one publicly campaigning against Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection?  <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> says that this information is &#x93;beside the point,&#x94; because WRTL&#x92;s history of overt electioneering only &#x93;goes to [its] subjective intent.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Did these &#x93;issue&#x94; ads begin appearing on the air during the election season, rather than at the time the filibuster &#x93;issue&#x94; was in fact being debated in the Senate?  This, too, is said to be irrelevant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  And does the website to which WRTL&#x92;s ads direct viewers contain material expressly advocating Senator Feingold&#x92;s defeat?  This enquiry is dismissed as being &#x93;one step removed from the text of the ads themselves.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  But these questions are central to the meaning of the ads, and any reasonable person would take account of circumstances in coming to understand the object of WRTL&#x92;s ad.  And why not?  Each of the contextual facts here can be established by an objective look at a public record; none requires a voter (or a litigant) to engage in discovery of evidence about WRTL&#x92;s operations or internal communications, and none goes to a hidden state of mind.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This refusal to see and hear what any listener to WRTL&#x92;s ads would actually consider produces a rule no different in practice from the one adopted by the District Court, which declined to look beyond the &#x93;four corners&#x94; of the ads themselves.  466 F. Supp. 2d 195, 207 (DC 2006).  Although <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> ostensibly stops short of categorically foreclosing consideration of context, see <em>ante</em>, at 20, the application of his test here makes it difficult to see how relevant contextual evidence could ever be taken into account the way it was in <em>McConnell</em>,<a name="ZD-19ref" href="#ZD-19" class="">

        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Third, it may be that the principal opinion rejects <em>McConnell </em>on the erroneous assumption that &#xA7;203 flatly bans independent electioneering communications by a corporation.  <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> argues that corporations must receive &#x93;the benefit of any doubt,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16,<em/>whenever we undertake the task of &#x93;separating &#x2026; political speech protected under the

But this is a fundamental misconception of the task at hand:  we have already held that it is &#x93; &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression,&#x94; because PAC financing provides corporations &#x93;with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy.&#x94;<a name="ZD-20ref" href="#ZD-20" class="">

            <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 203&#x96;204 (quoting <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 162).  Thus, a successful as-applied challenger to &#xA7;203 should necessarily show, at the least, that it could not constitutionally be subjected to the administrative rules that govern a PAC&#x92;s formation and operation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 163.  This would be an uphill fight, after our repeated affirmations that the PAC structure does not impose excessive burdens, <em>ibid.</em> (citing <em>National Right to Work Comm.</em>, 459 U. S., at 201&#x96;202), and WRTL has a particularly weak position on this point: it set up its own PAC long before the 2004 election, used it to campaign openly against Senator Feingold in the past, and could have raised noncorporate donations to it in the 2004 election cycle.  Any argument that establishing and maintaining a PAC is unconstitutionally burdensome for WRTL would thus likely be futile, and certainly should not prevail on WRTL&#x92;s summary judgment motion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, even without the PAC alternative, it would be untrue that &#xA7;203 &#x93;banned&#x94; WRTL from saying anything a genuine issue ad would say, for WRTL could have availed itself of either or both of the following additional options.  It is undisputed that WRTL&#x92;s ads could have been broadcast lawfully in the runup to the election (and bankrolled from WRTL&#x92;s general treasury) if Senator Feingold&#x92;s name had been omitted and the Senator not otherwise singled out.  Since members of today&#x92;s majority apparently view WRTL&#x92;s broadcasts either as &#x93;genuine issue ad[s],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16 (opinion of <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>), or as &#x93;lobby[ing] Wisconsin voters concerning the filibustering of the President&#x92;s judicial nominees,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 2 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.,</span> concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a claim that omitting Senator Feingold&#x92;s name would &#x93;ban&#x94; WRTL&#x92;s message is specious.  Yet one searches my Brothers&#x92; opinions in vain for any persuasive reason why substituting the phrase &#x93;Contact your Senators&#x94; for the phrase &#x93;Contact Senators Feingold and Kohl&#x94; would have denied WRTL a constitutionally sufficient (and clearly lawful) alternative way to send its message.  If WRTL is to be believed when it claims that the issue was the point of the ads, it would have lost nothing by referring simply to the &#x93;Senators.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the suggestion that &#xA7;203 is a ban on political speech is belied by <em>MCFL</em>&#x92;s safe harbor for nonprofit advocacy corporations: under that rule, WRTL would have been free to attack Senator Feingold by name at any time with ads funded from its corporate treasury, if it had not also chosen to serve as a funnel for hundreds of thousands of dollars from other corporations.  Thus, what is called a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech is a limit on the financing of electioneering broadcasts by entities that refuse to take advantage of the PAC structure but insist on acting as conduits from the campaign war chests of business corporations.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, <em>McConnell</em> does not graft a subjective standard onto campaign regulation, the context of campaign advertising cannot sensibly be ignored, and &#xA7;203 is not a ban on speech.  What cannot be gainsaid, in any event, is that in treating these subjects as it does, the operative opinion produces the result of overruling <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding on &#xA7;203, less than four years in the Reports.  Anyone who doubts that need merely ask what the law would have been if, back in 2003, this Court had held &#xA7;203 facially unconstitutional.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    BCRA&#x92;s definition of &#x93;electioneering communication,&#x94; which identifies the communications regulable under &#xA7;203, includes a backup to be used if the primary definition &#x93;is held to be constitutionally insufficient by final judicial decision to support the regulation provided herein.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_A_ii" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(A)(ii)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If this should occur, &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; is to be defined as </p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This backup sounds familiar because it is essentially identical to <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s test for evaluating an as-applied challenge to the original definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94;: regulation is permissible only if the communication is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16.  Thus does the principal opinion institute the very standard that would have prevailed if the Court formally overruled <em>McConnell</em>.  There is neither a theoretical nor a practical basis to claim that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s treatment of &#xA7;203 survives.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">E</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The price of <em>McConnell&#x92;</em>s<em/>demise as authority on &#xA7;203 seems to me to be a high one.  The Court (and, I think, the country) loses when important precedent is overruled without good reason, and there is no justification for departing from our usual rule of <em>stare decisis</em> here.  The same combination of alternatives that was available to corporations affected by <em>McConnell</em> in 2003 is available today: WRTL could have run a newspaper ad, could have paid for the broadcast ads through its PAC, could have established itself as an <em>MCFL</em> organization free of corporate money, and could have said &#x93;call your Senators&#x94; instead of naming Senator Feingold in its ads broadcasted just before the election.  Nothing in the related law surrounding &#xA7;203 has changed in any way, let alone in any way that undermines <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>rationale.

        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, it goes without saying that nothing has changed about the facts.  In Justice Frankfurter&#x92;s words, they demonstrate a threat to &#x93;the integrity of our electoral process,&#x94; <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 570, which for a century now Congress has repeatedly found to be imperiled by corporate, and later union, money: witness the Tillman Act, Taft-Hartley, FECA, and BCRA.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  <em>McConnell </em>was our latest decision vindicating clear and reasonable boundaries that Congress has drawn to limit &#x93; &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth,&#x92; &#x94; 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660), and the decision could claim the justification of ongoing fact as well as decisional history in recognizing Congress&#x92;s authority to protect the integrity of elections from the distortion of corporate and union funds.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After today, the ban on contributions by corporations and unions and the limitation on their corrosive spending when they enter the political arena are open to easy circumvention, and the possibilities for regulating corporate and union campaign money are unclear.  The ban on contributions will mean nothing much, now that companies and unions can save candidates the expense of advertising directly, simply by running &#x93;issue ads&#x94; without express advocacy, or by funneling the money through an independent corporation like WRTL.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the understanding of the voters and the Congress that this kind of corporate and union spending seriously jeopardizes the integrity of democratic government will remain.  The facts are too powerful to be ignored, and further efforts at campaign finance reform will come.  It is only the legal landscape that now is altered, and it may be that today&#x92;s departure from precedent will drive further reexamination of the constitutional analysis: of the distinction between contributions and expenditures, or the relation between spending and speech, which have given structure to our thinking since <em>Buckley</em> itself was decided.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    I cannot tell what the future will force upon us, but I respectfully dissent from this judgment today.</p>

Justice Scalia asserts that Austin &#x93;strayed far from&#x94; the principles we announced in First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/435/765" class="subref" title="subref">435 U. S. 765</a> (1978)
.  Ante, at 7 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Bellotti, however, concerned corporate spending in connection with a referendum, and we went out of our way in that case to avoid casting any doubt upon the constitutionality of limiting corporate expenditures during candidate elections.  We said:


&#x93;The overriding concern behind the enactment of [the federal restrictions on corporate contributions and expenditures] was the problem of corruption of elected representatives through the creation of political debts.  The importance of the governmental interest in preventing this occurrence has never been doubted.  The case before us presents no comparable problem, and our consideration of a corporation&#x92;s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.  Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.&#x94;  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26 (citations omitted).


Eight years before Austin, we unanimously reaffirmed that Bellotti &#x93;specifically pointed out that in elections of candidates to public office, unlike in referenda on issues of general public interest, there may well be a threat of real or apparent corruption.&#x94;  Federal Election Comm&#x92;n v.

.  Then, four years later, in MCFL, we also noted that an expenditure limit offering corporations a PAC alternative is &#x93;distinguishable from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for political speech&#x94; that we addressed in Bellotti.  479 U. S., at 259, n. 12.  So Austin did not &#x93;stra[y]&#x94; from Bellotti, ante, at 7 (opinion of Scalia, J.); the reasons Bellotti was not controlling in Austin had been clearly foreshadowed in Bellotti itself and confirmed repeatedly in our decisions leading up to Austin.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-10" href="#ZD-10ref">10</a> The Senate Committee was not alone in its concerns.  In Wisconsin, for example, the Governor&#x92;s Blue-Ribbon Commission on Campaign Finance Reform reported:


&#x93;Especially beginning in 1996, issue advocacy during the campaign season dramatically expanded in Wisconsin.
.....


&#x93;The Commission concludes that, in each of these cases, the expenditures were clearly campaign-oriented activities.  They were quite clearly designed to influence the electoral process.  They were focused either on electing or defeating a candidate.  The Commission bases this conclusion on the following points:


&#x93;Although those paying for the activities claimed they were aimed solely at educating voters on the issues, they each mentioned the names of candidates for office.


&#x93;They occurred only when election races were in progress that involved a contest between an incumbent and a challenger.  When the election was over, the activities ended.


&#x93;The activity has occurred after legislative sessions when the issues about which advocacy was occurring were not being deliberated by the legislature.


&#x93;The activity occurred in campaign season, between the candidate&#x92;s filing for candidacy and election time.  Advertisements of this sort have tended to occur at virtually no other time.


&#x93;The activity involved the electronic media, mass mailings, or centrally located telephone banks.
.....


&#x93;The explosive growth of campaign-based advocacy, without even disclosure of its activities and funding sources, poses a grave risk to the integrity of elections. It has created a two-tiered campaign process: one, based in candidates and political parties, which is tightly regulated and controlled; the other, based in interest group activity under the guise of &#x91;issue advocacy&#x92; but actually quite clearly election-focused, which lies beyond accountability.&#x94;  1 Governor&#x92;s Blue-Ribbon Commission on Campaign Finance Reform, State of Wisconsin: Report of the Commission, available at http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-17" href="#ZD-17ref">17</a> The Chief Justice says that Buckley v. Valeo, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
 (per curiam), &#x93;already rejected&#x94; any test that calls for an assessment of the intent and effect of corporate electioneering.  Ante, at 13.  The &#x93;reject[ion]&#x94; to which The Chief Justice presumably refers is Buckley&#x92;s quotation of Thomas v. Collins, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/516" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 516</a> (1945)
, where we found impermissibly vague a statute that permitted a union leader to &#x93; &#x91;laud unionism&#x92; &#x94; but forbade him to &#x93;imply an invitation&#x94; to join a union.  Id., at 534.  The problem with this predicament, we reasoned, was the lack of a clearly permissible opportunity for expression:  Whether words &#x93;designed to fall short of invitation would miss that mark is a question both of intent and of effect,&#x94; and no speaker &#x93;safely could assume that anything he might say &#x2026; would not be understood by some as an invitation.&#x94;  Id., at 535.  We then specified that the speaker in Thomas was left with an impermissibly limited universe of &#x93;three choices: (1) to stand on his right and speak freely; (2) to quit, refusing entirely to speak; (3) to trim, and even thus to risk the penalty.&#x94;  Id., at 536.


The Chief Justice implies that considering the intent and effect of corporate advertising during as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203 would put corporations in precisely the same bind; thus, he wonders how McConnell could use the language of intent and effect without &#x93;even address[ing] what Buckley&#x94; (and by extension, Thomas) &#x93;had to say on the subject.&#x94;  Ante, at 14.  But one need not look far in our McConnell opinion to understand why we thought that corporations have more than the constrained set of options available to the union leader in Thomas.  Just a few sentences after holding that ads with electioneering intent and effect are regulable, we gave this explanation: &#x93;in the future corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads [shortly before an election] by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.  In other words, corporations can find refuge in constitutionally sufficient and clearly delineated safe harbors by modifying the content of their ads (by omitting a candidate&#x92;s name) or by altering the sources of their ads&#x92; financing (from general treasuries to PACs).  The Chief Justice thus wrongly jettisons our conclusions about the constitutionality of regulating ads with electioneering purpose; we meant what we said in McConnell, and we did not overlook 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence when we said it.  Whereas The Chief Justice says that BCRA &#x93;should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights,&#x94; ante, at 14, we already held in McConnell that the campaign finance law accomplishes precisely that.
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-18" href="#ZD-18ref">18</a> The Chief Justice speculates that McConnell derived its test for functional equivalence from &#x93;[t]wo key studies,&#x94; ante, at 12, but not a shred of language in McConnell supports that theory.  In stating the legal standard, McConnell made no mention of any study.  What is the authority, then, for asserting that the studies were pivotal to the standard we announced in McConnell?  See ante, at 12.  Other than WRTL&#x92;s brief, The Chief Justice cites only Judge Henderson&#x92;s separate district court opinion in McConnell.  Ante, at 12.  But The Chief Justice quotes one part of Judge Henderson&#x92;s analysis and neglects to mention that she in turn was quoting the lead author of one of the studies in question: &#x93;According to the Brennan Center, the Buying Time reports were &#x91;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of&#x92; BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions &#x91;in support of their constitutional validity.&#x92; &#x94;  McConnell, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 307&#x96;308 (opinion of Henderson, J.) (italics in original) (quoting deposition of Craig P. Holman, principal co-author of Buying Time 2000: Television Advertising in the 2000 Federal Elections (Brennan Center 2001)).
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-19" href="#ZD-19ref">19</a> Like the District Court, the only bit of context The Chief Justice would allow the reasonable listener is the congressional agenda: whether the &#x93; &#x91;issue&#x92; &#x94; addressed in an ad currently is, or soon will be, &#x93; &#x91;the subject of legislative scrutiny.&#x92; &#x94;  Ante, at 20 (quoting 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 207).  For example, The Chief Justice says, there would have been &#x93;no reason&#x94; to think that WRTL&#x92;s ad constituted anything but a pure issue ad if it addressed a bill pending during Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection campaign, such as the Universal National Service Act.  Ante, at 17.  It is revealing, of course, that The Chief Justice does not invoke the filibuster issue, the subject of WRTL&#x92;s ads, as the legislative matter with particular salience during the 2004 election.  But why the reasonable listener can look to Congress but not the calendar on the wall or a WRTL website is difficult to fathom.
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-20" href="#ZD-20ref">20</a>Justice Scalia also adopts the same misconception that &#xA7;203 is a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech.  See ante, at 18 (&#x93;Section 203&#x92;s line is bright, but it bans vast amounts of political advocacy indistinguishable from hitherto protected speech&#x94;).
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-21" href="#ZD-21ref">21</a> These as-applied challenges provide no reason to second-guess our conclusion in McConnell that the rule for differentiating between electioneering ads and genuine issue ads is administrable.  WRTL&#x92;s ads clearly have an electioneering purpose and, as explained above, fall comfortably within the heartland of electioneering communications that &#xA7;203 may validly regulate.  Thus, although Justice Scalia claims that &#x93;[t]oday&#x92;s cases make it apparent&#x94; that McConnell must be overruled, ante, at 18, there is nothing about today&#x92;s cases that suggests that McConnell is unworkable.  We therefore have no occasion to reconsider McConnell from first principles.

        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensable ingredient of a political candidacy is money for advertising.  In the 2004 campaign, more than half of the combined expenditures by the two principal presidential candidates (excluding fundraising) went for media time and space.  See The Costliest Campaign, Washington Post, Dec. 30, 2004, p. A7.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            </a>  And in the 2005&#x96;2006 election cycle, the expenditure of more than $2 billion on television shattered the previous record, even without a presidential contest.  See Inside Media, MediaWeek, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 18.  The portent is for still greater spending.  By the end of March 2007, almost a year before the first primary and more than 18 months before the general election, presidential candidates had already raised over $150 million.  See Balz, Fundraising Totals Challenge Early Campaign Assumptions, Washington Post, Apr. 17, 2007, p. A1 (citing figures and noting that &#x93;[t]he campaign is living up to its reputation as the most expensive in U. S. history&#x94;).  To reach this total, the leading fundraisers collected over $250,000 per day in the first quarter of 2007, Mullins, Clinton Leads the Money Race, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2007, p. A8, and the eventual nominees are expected to raise $500 million apiece (about $680,000 per day over a 2-year election cycle), Kirkpatrick and Pilhofer, McCain Lags in Income But Excels in Spending, Report Shows, N. Y. Times, Apr. 15, 2007, p. 20.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensability of these huge sums has two significant consequences for American Government that are particularly on point here.  The enormous demands, first, assign power to deep pockets.  See Balz, <em>supra</em>, at A6 (&#x93;For all the interest in Internet fundraising, big donors still ruled in the first quarter, with roughly 80 percent of donations coming in amounts of $1,000 or more&#x94;).  Candidates occasionally boast about the number of contributors they have, but the headlines speaking in dollars reflect political reality.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Mullins, <em>supra</em>, at A8 (headlined &#x93;Clinton Leads the Money Race&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Some major contributors get satisfaction from pitching in for their candidates, but political preference fails to account for the frequency of giving &#x93;substantial sums to <em>both</em> major national parties,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 148, a practice driven &#x93;by stark political pragmatism, not by ideological support for either party or their candidates,&#x94; Brief for Committee for Economic Development et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> in <em>McConnell</em>, O. T. 2003, No. 02&#x96;1674, p. 3 (hereinafter CED Brief).  What the high-dollar pragmatists of either variety get is special access to the officials they help elect, and with it a disproportionate influence on those in power.  See <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em/>at 130&#x96;131.  As the erstwhile officer of a large American corporation put it, &#x93; &#x91;[b]usiness leaders believe&#x97;based on experience and with good reason&#x97;that &#x2026; access gives them an opportunity to shape and affect governmental decisions and that their ability to do so derives from the fact that they have given large sums of money to the parties.&#x92; &#x94;  CED Brief 9.  At a critical level, contributions that underwrite elections are leverage for enormous political influence.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Voters know this.  Hence, the second important consequence of the demand for big money to finance publicity: pervasive public cynicism.  A 2002 poll found that 71 percent of Americans think Members of Congress cast votes based on the views of their big contributors, even when those views differ from the Member&#x92;s own beliefs about what is best for the country.  Mellman &amp; Wirthlin 267; see also <em>id.</em>, at 266 (&#x93;In public opinion research it is uncommon to have 70 percent or more of the public see an issue the same way.  When they do, it indicates an unusually strong agreement on that issue&#x94;).  The same percentage believes that the will of contributors tempts Members to vote against the majority view of their constituents.  <em>Id.</em>, at 267.  Almost half of Americans believe that Members often decide how to vote based on what big contributors to their party want, while only a quarter think Members often base their votes on perceptions of what is best for the country or their constituents.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Devoting concentrations of money in self-interested hands to the support of political campaigning therefore threatens the capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents and the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves.  These are the elements summed up in the notion of political integrity, giving it a value second to none in a free society.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    If the threat to this value flowing from concentrations of money in politics has reached an unprecedented enormity, it has been gathering force for generations.  Before the turn of the last century, as now, it was obvious that the purchase of influence and the cynicism of voters threaten the integrity and stability of democratic government, each derived from the responsiveness of its law to the interests of citizens and their confidence in that focus.  The danger has traditionally seemed at its apex when no reasonable limits constrain the campaign activities of organizations whose &#x93;unique legal and economic characteristics&#x94; are tailored to &#x93;facilitat[e] the amassing of large treasuries,&#x94; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Thirty years later, new questions about the electoral influence of accumulated wealth surfaced as organized labor expanded during the New Deal.  In the 1936 election, labor unions contributed &#x93;unprecedented&#x94; sums, S. Rep. No. 151, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 127 (1937), the greater part of them by the United Mine Workers, see Campaign Finance Sourcebook 17.  And in due course reaction began to build: &#x93;[w]artime strikes gave rise to fears of the new concentration of power represented by the gains of trade unionism.  And so the belief grew that, just as the great corporations had made huge political contributions to influence governmental action &#x2026; , the powerful unions were pursuing a similar course, and with the same untoward consequences for the democratic process.&#x94;  <em>Automobile Workers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 578.

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">57</a>Stat.

        <p class="bodytext">    At the same time, Congress had another worry that foreshadows our case today.  It was concerned that the statutory prohibition on corporate &#x93;contribution[s]&#x94; was being so narrowly construed as to open a &#x93;loophole whereby corporations, national banks, and labor organizations are enabled to avoid the obviously intended restrictive policy of the statute by garbing their financial assistance in the form of an &#x91;expenditure&#x92; rather than a contribution.&#x94;  S. Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38&#x96;39 (1947); see also H. Rep. No. 2739, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 40 (1947) (&#x93;The intent and purpose of the provision of the act prohibiting any corporation or labor organization making any contribution in connection with any election would be wholly defeated if it were assumed that the term &#x91;making any contribution&#x92; related only to the donating of money directly to a candidate, and excluded the vast expenditures of money in the activities herein shown to be engaged in extensively.  Of what avail would a law be to prohibit the contributing direct to a candidate and yet permit the expenditure of large sums in his behalf?&#x94;).

        <p class="bodytext">    The new law left open, however, the right of a union to spend money on electioneering from a segregated fund raised specifically for that purpose from members, but not drawn from the general treasury.  Segregated funding entities, the now-familiar political action committees or PACs, had been established prior to Taft-Hartley, and we concluded in <em>Pipefitters</em> v. <em>United States</em>,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/441b.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;441b</a>, and drew two conclusions implicated in the present case.  First, we construed the &#x93;in connection with&#x94; phrase in much the same way we had interpreted comparable FECA language challenged in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)

        <p class="bodytext">    We thus held that the prohibition applied &#x93;only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 44.  &#x93;[E]xpress terms,&#x94; in turn, meant what had already become known as &#x93;magic words,&#x94; such as &#x93; &#x91;vote for,&#x92; &#x91;elect,&#x92; &#x91;support,&#x92; &#x91;cast your ballot for,&#x92; &#x91;Smith for Congress,&#x92; &#x91;vote against,&#x92; &#x91;defeat,&#x92; &#x91;reject.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>,<em/>n. 52.  The consequence of this construction was obvious: it pulled the teeth out of the statute, as we had understood when we announced it in its earlier application in Buckley:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness &#x2026; undermines the limitation&#x92;s effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or officeholder.  It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate&#x92;s campaign.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 45.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nor was the statute, even as thus narrowed, enforceable against the particular advocacy corporation challenging the limit in <em>MCFL</em>.

Experience showed, however, just what we foresaw in <em>Buckley</em>, that the line between &#x93;issue&#x94; broadcasts and outright electioneering was a patent fiction, as in the example of a television &#x93;issue ad&#x94; that ran during a Montana congressional race between Republican Rick Hill and Democrat Bill Yellowtail in 1996:</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>McConnell</em>, we found this definition to be &#x93;easily understood and objectiv[e],&#x94; raising &#x93;none of the vagueness concerns that drove our analysis&#x94; of the statutory language at issue in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em>, 540 U.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  We rejected any suggestion &#x93;that <em>Buckley</em> drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy [with magic words] and so-called issue advocacy [without them], and that speakers possess an inviolable 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to engage in the latter category of speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 190.  To the contrary, we held that &#x93;our decisions in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em> were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 192&#x96;193.  &#x93;[T]he presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech,&#x94; which is prohibitable, &#x93;from a true issue ad,&#x94; we said, since ads that &#x93;esche[w] the use of magic words &#x2026; are no less clearly intended to influence the election.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 193.  We thus found &#x93;[l]ittle difference &#x2026; between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We understood that Congress had a compelling interest in limiting this sort of electioneering by corporations and unions, for &#xA7;203 exemplified a tradition of &#x93;repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U.

Nor did we see any plausible claim of substantial overbreadth from incidentally prohibiting ads genuinely focused on issues rather than elections, given the limitation of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; by time, geographical coverage, and clear reference to candidate.  &#x93;Far from establishing that BCRA&#x92;s application to pure issue ads is substantial, either in an absolute sense or relative to its application to election-related advertising, the record strongly supports the contrary conclusion.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 207.  Finally, we underscored the reasonableness of the &#xA7;203 line by emphasizing that it defined a category of limited, but not prohibited, corporate and union speech: &#x93;Because corporations can still fund electioneering communications with PAC money, it is &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression rather than a regulation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 204 (quoting <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em> v. <em>Beaumont</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, Congress in 1907 prohibited corporate contributions to candidates and in 1943 applied the same ban to unions.  In 1947, Congress extended the complete ban from contributions to expenditures &#x93;in connection with&#x94; an election, a phrase so vague that in 1986 we held it must be confined to instances of express advocacy using magic words.  Congress determined, in 2002, that corporate and union expenditures for fake issue ads devoid of magic words should be regulated using a narrow definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; to reach only broadcast ads that were the practical equivalents of express advocacy.  In 2003, this Court found the provision free from vagueness and justified by the concern that drove its enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This century-long tradition of legislation and judicial precedent rests on facing undeniable facts and testifies to an equally undeniable value.  Campaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries, with no redolence of &#x93;grassroots&#x94; about them.  Neither Congress&#x92;s decisions nor our own have understood the corrupting influence of money in politics as being limited to outright bribery or discrete <em>quid pro quo; </em>campaign finance reform has instead consistently focused on the more pervasive distortion of electoral institutions by concentrated wealth, on the special access and guaranteed favor that sap the representative integrity of American government and defy public confidence in its institutions.  From early in the 20th century through the decision in <em>McConnell</em>, we have acknowledged that the value of democratic integrity justifies a realistic response when corporations and labor organizations commit the concentrated moneys in their treasuries to electioneering.</p>

            </a>  In 2004, WRTL accepted over $315,000 in corporate donations, App. 40, and of its six general fund contributions of $50,000 or more between 2002 and 2005, three, including the largest (for $140,000), came from corporate donors, <em>id.</em>, at 118&#x96;121.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL also runs a PAC, funded by individual donations, which has been active over the years in making independent campaign expenditures, as in the previous two elections involving Senator Feingold.  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  During the 1998 campaign, for example, WRTL&#x92;s PAC spent $60,000 to oppose him.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In 2004, however, despite a sharp nationwide increase in PAC receipts, WRTL focused its fundraising on its corporate treasury, not the PAC, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;43, and took in only $17,000 in PAC contributions, as against over $150,000 during 2000, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;42.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Throughout the 2004 senatorial campaign, WRTL made no secret of its views about who should win the election and explicitly tied its position to the filibuster issue.  Its PAC issued at least two press releases saying that its &#x93;Top Election Priorities&#x94; were to &#x93;Re-elect George W. Bush&#x94; and &#x93;Send Feingold Packing!&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 78&#x96;80, 82&#x96;84.  In one of these, the Chair of WRTL&#x92;s PAC was quoted as saying, &#x93; &#x91;We do not want Russ Feingold to continue to have the ability to thwart President Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 82&#x96;83.  The Spring 2004 issue of the WRTL PAC&#x92;s quarterly magazine ran an article headlined &#x93;Radically Pro-Abortion Feingold Must Go!&#x94;, which reported that &#x93;Feingold has been active in his opposition to Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees&#x94; and said that &#x93;the defeat of Feingold must be uppermost in the minds of Wisconsin&#x92;s pro-life community in the 2004 elections.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 101&#x96;103.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    It was under these circumstances that WRTL ran the three television and radio ads in question.  The bills for them were not paid by WRTL&#x92;s PAC, but out of the general treasury with its substantial proportion of corporate contributions; in fact, corporations earmarked more than $50,000 specifically to pay for the ads, <em>id.</em>, at 41.  Each one criticized an unnamed &#x93;group of Senators&#x94; for &#x93;using the filibuster delay tactic to block federal judicial nominees from a simple &#x91;yes&#x92; or &#x91;no&#x92; vote,&#x94; and described the Senators&#x92; actions as &#x93;politics at work, causing gridlock and backing up some of our courts to a state of emergency.&#x94;<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>  They exhorted viewers and listeners to &#x93;[c]ontact Senators Feingold and Kohl and tell them to oppose the filibuster,&#x94; but instead of providing a phone number or e-mail address, they told the audience to go to BeFair.org, a website set up by WRTL.  A visit to this website would erase any doubt a listener or viewer might have as to whether Senators Feingold and Kohl were part of the &#x93;group&#x94; condemned in the ads: it displayed a document that criticized the two Senators for voting to filibuster &#x93;16 out of 16 times&#x94; and accused them of &#x93;putting politics into the court system, creating gridlock, and costing taxpayers money.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 86.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL&#x92;s planned airing of the ads had no apparent relation to any Senate filibuster vote but was keyed to the timing of the senatorial election.  WRTL began broadcasting the ads on July 26, 2004, four days after the Senate recessed for the summer, and although the filibuster controversy raged on through 2005, WRTL did not resume running the ads after the election.  <em>Id.</em>, at 29, 32.  During the campaign period that the ads did cover, Senator Feingold&#x92;s support of the filibusters was a prominent issue.  His position was well known,<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, any Wisconsin voter who paid attention would have known that Democratic Senator Feingold supported filibusters against Republican presidential judicial nominees, that the propriety of the filibusters was a major issue in the senatorial campaign, and that WRTL along with the Senator&#x92;s Republican challengers opposed his reelection because of his position on filibusters.  Any alert voters who heard or saw WRTL&#x92;s ads would have understood that WRTL was telling them that the Senator&#x92;s position on the filibusters should be grounds to vote against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given these facts, it is beyond all reasonable debate that the ads are constitutionally subject to regulation under <em>McConnell</em>.  There, we noted that BCRA was meant to remedy the problem of &#x93;[s]o-called issue ads&#x94; being used &#x93;to advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 126.  We then gave a paradigmatic example of these electioneering ads subject to regulation, saying that &#x93;[l]ittle difference existed . . . between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The WRTL ads were indistinguishable from the Jane Doe ad; they &#x93;condemned [Senator Feingold&#x92;s] record on a particular issue&#x94; and exhorted the public to contact him and &#x93;tell [him] what you think.&#x94;<a name="ZD-16ref" href="#ZD-16" class="">

                    <b>16</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And just as anyone who heard the Jane Doe ad would understand that the point was to defeat Doe, anyone who heard the Feingold ads (let alone anyone who went to the website they named) would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.  If it is now unconstitutional to restrict WRTL&#x92;s Feingold ads, then it follows that &#xA7;203 can no longer be applied constitutionally to <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>Jane Doe paradigm.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding that &#xA7;203 is facially constitutional is overruled.  By what steps does the principal opinion reach this unacknowledged result less than four years after <em>McConnell</em> was decided?</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, it lays down a new test to identify a severely limited class of ads that may constitutionally be regulated as electioneering communications, a test that is flatly contrary to <em>McConnell</em>.  An ad is the equivalent of express advocacy and subject to regulation, the opinion says, only if it is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Since the Feingold ads could, in isolation, be read as at least including calls to communicate views on filibusters to the two Senators, those ads cannot be treated as the functional equivalent of express advocacy to elect or defeat anyone, and therefore may not constitutionally be regulated at all.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the same could have been said of the hypothetical Jane Doe ad.  Its spoken message ended with the instruction to tell Doe what the voter thinks.  The same could also have been said of the actual Yellowtail ad.  Yet in <em>McConnell</em>, we gave the Jane Doe ad as the paradigm of a broadcast message that could be constitutionally regulated as election conduct, and we explicitly described the Yellowtail ad as a &#x93;striking example&#x94; of one that was &#x93;clearly intended to influence the election,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 193, and n. 78.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The principal opinion, in other words, simply inverts what we said in <em>McConnell</em>.  While we left open the possibility of a &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure&#x94; issue ad that might not be open to regulation under &#xA7;203, <em>id.</em>, at 206&#x96;207, and n. 88, we meant that an issue ad without campaign advocacy could escape the restriction.  The implication of the adjectives &#x93;genuine&#x94; and &#x93;pure&#x94; is unmistakable: if an ad is reasonably understood as going beyond a discussion of issues (that is, if it can be understood as electoral advocacy), then by definition it is not &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure.&#x94;  But the principal opinion inexplicably wrings the opposite conclusion from those words: if an ad is susceptible to any &#x93;reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; then it must be a &#x93;pure&#x94; or &#x93;genuine&#x94; issue ad.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  This stands <em>McConnell</em> on its head, and on this reasoning it is pos-<span class="softbreak"/>sible that even some ads with magic words could not be regulated.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Second, the principal opinion seems to defend this inversion of <em>McConnell</em> as a necessary alternative to an unadministrable subjective test for the equivalence of express (and regulable) electioneering advocacy.  The principal opinion acknowledges, of course, that in <em>McConnell</em> we said that &#x93;[t]he justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during [the period shortly before an election] if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;  540 U.

But <em>McConnell</em> did not do that.  It did not purport to draw constitutional lines based on the subjective motivations of corporations (or their principals) sponsoring political ads, but merely described our test for equivalence to express advocacy as resting on the ads&#x92; &#x93;electioneering purpose,&#x94; which will be objectively apparent from those ads&#x92; content and context (as these cases and the examples cited in <em>McConnell </em>readily show).  We therefore held that &#xA7;203 was not substantially overbroad because &#x93;the vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose,&#x94; and consequently could be regulated consistent with the

The authors of those studies did not conduct discovery of the &#x93;actua[l] inten[tions],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14, behind any ads; nor, to my knowledge, were the sponsors of campaign ads summoned before researchers to explain their motivations.

This, too, is said to be irrelevant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  And does the website to which WRTL&#x92;s ads direct viewers contain material expressly advocating Senator Feingold&#x92;s defeat?  This enquiry is dismissed as being &#x93;one step removed from the text of the ads themselves.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  But these questions are central to the meaning of the ads, and any reasonable person would take account of circumstances in coming to understand the object of WRTL&#x92;s ad.  And why not?  Each of the contextual facts here can be established by an objective look at a public record; none requires a voter (or a litigant) to engage in discovery of evidence about WRTL&#x92;s operations or internal communications, and none goes to a hidden state of mind.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This refusal to see and hear what any listener to WRTL&#x92;s ads would actually consider produces a rule no different in practice from the one adopted by the District Court, which declined to look beyond the &#x93;four corners&#x94; of the ads themselves.  466 F. Supp. 2d 195, 207 (DC 2006).  Although <span class="smallcaps">The</span>

        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Third, it may be that the principal opinion rejects <em>McConnell </em>on the erroneous assumption that &#xA7;203 flatly bans independent electioneering communications by a corporation.  <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> argues that corporations must receive &#x93;the benefit of any doubt,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16,<em/>whenever we undertake the task of &#x93;separating &#x2026; political speech protected under the

But this is a fundamental misconception of the task at hand:  we have already held that it is &#x93; &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression,&#x94; because PAC financing provides corporations &#x93;with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy.&#x94;<a name="ZD-20ref" href="#ZD-20" class="">

            <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 203&#x96;204 (quoting <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 162).  Thus, a successful as-applied challenger to &#xA7;203 should necessarily show, at the least, that it could not constitutionally be subjected to the administrative rules that govern a PAC&#x92;s formation and operation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 163.  This would be an uphill fight, after our repeated affirmations that the PAC structure does not impose excessive burdens, <em>ibid.</em> (citing <em>National Right to Work Comm.</em>, 459 U. S., at 201&#x96;202), and WRTL has a particularly weak position on this point: it set up its own PAC long before the 2004 election, used it to campaign openly against Senator Feingold in the past, and could have raised noncorporate donations to it in the 2004 election cycle.  Any argument that establishing and maintaining a PAC is unconstitutionally burdensome for WRTL would thus likely be futile, and certainly should not prevail on WRTL&#x92;s summary judgment motion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, even without the PAC alternative, it would be untrue that &#xA7;203 &#x93;banned&#x94; WRTL from saying anything a genuine issue ad would say, for WRTL could have availed itself of either or both of the following additional options.  It is undisputed that WRTL&#x92;s ads could have been broadcast lawfully in the runup to the election (and bankrolled from WRTL&#x92;s general treasury) if Senator Feingold&#x92;s name had been omitted and the Senator not otherwise singled out.  Since members of today&#x92;s majority apparently view WRTL&#x92;s broadcasts either as &#x93;genuine issue ad[s],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16 (opinion of <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>), or as &#x93;lobby[ing] Wisconsin voters concerning the filibustering of the President&#x92;s judicial nominees,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 2 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.,</span> concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a claim that omitting Senator Feingold&#x92;s name would &#x93;ban&#x94; WRTL&#x92;s message is specious.  Yet one searches my Brothers&#x92; opinions in vain for any persuasive reason why substituting the phrase &#x93;Contact your Senators&#x94; for the phrase &#x93;Contact Senators Feingold and Kohl&#x94; would have denied WRTL a constitutionally sufficient (and clearly lawful) alternative way to send its message.  If WRTL is to be believed when it claims that the issue was the point of the ads, it would have lost nothing by referring simply to the &#x93;Senators.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the suggestion that &#xA7;203 is a ban on political speech is belied by <em>MCFL</em>&#x92;s safe harbor for nonprofit advocacy corporations: under that rule, WRTL would have been free to attack Senator Feingold by name at any time with ads funded from its corporate treasury, if it had not also chosen to serve as a funnel for hundreds of thousands of dollars from other corporations.  Thus, what is called a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech is a limit on the financing of electioneering broadcasts by entities that refuse to take advantage of the PAC structure but insist on acting as conduits from the campaign war chests of business corporations.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, <em>McConnell</em> does not graft a subjective standard onto campaign regulation, the context of campaign advertising cannot sensibly be ignored, and &#xA7;203 is not a ban on speech.  What cannot be gainsaid, in any event, is that in treating these subjects as it does, the operative opinion produces the result of overruling <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding on &#xA7;203, less than four years in the Reports.  Anyone who doubts that need merely ask what the law would have been if, back in 2003, this Court had held &#xA7;203 facially unconstitutional.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    BCRA&#x92;s definition of &#x93;electioneering communication,&#x94; which identifies the communications regulable under &#xA7;203, includes a backup to be used if the primary definition &#x93;is held to be constitutionally insufficient by final judicial decision to support the regulation provided herein.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_A_ii" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(A)(ii)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If this should occur, &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; is to be defined as </p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This backup sounds familiar because it is essentially identical to <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s test for evaluating an as-applied challenge to the original definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94;: regulation is permissible only if the communication is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16.  Thus does the principal opinion institute the very standard that would have prevailed if the Court formally overruled <em>McConnell</em>.  There is neither a theoretical nor a practical basis to claim that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s treatment of &#xA7;203 survives.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">E</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The price of <em>McConnell&#x92;</em>s<em/>demise as authority on &#xA7;203 seems to me to be a high one.  The Court (and, I think, the country) loses when important precedent is overruled without good reason, and there is no justification for departing from our usual rule of <em>stare decisis</em> here.  The same combination of alternatives that was available to corporations affected by <em>McConnell</em> in 2003 is available today: WRTL could have run a newspaper ad, could have paid for the broadcast ads through its PAC, could have established itself as an <em>MCFL</em> organization free of corporate money, and could have said &#x93;call your Senators&#x94; instead of naming Senator Feingold in its ads broadcasted just before the election.  Nothing in the related law surrounding &#xA7;203 has changed in any way, let alone in any way that undermines <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>rationale.  See <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Nor can any serious argument be made that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding has been &#x93;unworkable in practice.&#x94;  <em>Allied-Signal, Inc.</em> v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, it goes without saying that nothing has changed about the facts.  In Justice Frankfurter&#x92;s words, they demonstrate a threat to &#x93;the integrity of our electoral process,&#x94; <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 570, which for a century now Congress has repeatedly found to be imperiled by corporate, and later union, money: witness the Tillman Act, Taft-Hartley, FECA, and BCRA.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  <em>McConnell </em>was our latest decision vindicating clear and reasonable boundaries that Congress has drawn to limit &#x93; &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth,&#x92; &#x94; 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660), and the decision could claim the justification of ongoing fact as well as decisional history in recognizing Congress&#x92;s authority to protect the integrity of elections from the distortion of corporate and union funds.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After today, the ban on contributions by corporations and unions and the limitation on their corrosive spending when they enter the political arena are open to easy circumvention, and the possibilities for regulating corporate and union campaign money are unclear.  The ban on contributions will mean nothing much, now that companies and unions can save candidates the expense of advertising directly, simply by running &#x93;issue ads&#x94; without express advocacy, or by funneling the money through an independent corporation like WRTL.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the understanding of the voters and the Congress that this kind of corporate and union spending seriously jeopardizes the integrity of democratic government will remain.  The facts are too powerful to be ignored, and further efforts at campaign finance reform will come.  It is only the legal landscape that now is altered, and it may be that today&#x92;s departure from precedent will drive further reexamination of the constitutional analysis: of the distinction between contributions and expenditures, or the relation between spending and speech, which have given structure to our thinking since <em>Buckley</em> itself was decided.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    I cannot tell what the future will force upon us, but I respectfully dissent from this judgment today.</p>

Justice Scalia asserts that Austin &#x93;strayed far from&#x94; the principles we announced in First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,

.  Ante, at 7 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Bellotti, however, concerned corporate spending in connection with a referendum, and we went out of our way in that case to avoid casting any doubt upon the constitutionality of limiting corporate expenditures during candidate elections.  We said:


&#x93;The overriding concern behind the enactment of [the federal restrictions on corporate contributions and expenditures] was the problem of corruption of elected representatives through the creation of political debts.  The importance of the governmental interest in preventing this occurrence has never been doubted.  The case before us presents no comparable problem, and our consideration of a corporation&#x92;s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.  Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.&#x94;  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26 (citations omitted).


Eight years before Austin, we unanimously reaffirmed that Bellotti &#x93;specifically pointed out that in elections of candidates to public office, unlike in referenda on issues of general public interest, there may well be a threat of real or apparent corruption.&#x94;  Federal Election Comm&#x92;n v.

So Austin did not &#x93;stra[y]&#x94; from Bellotti, ante, at 7 (opinion of Scalia, J.); the reasons Bellotti was not controlling in Austin had been clearly foreshadowed in Bellotti itself and confirmed repeatedly in our decisions leading up to Austin.

&#x93;Especially beginning in 1996, issue advocacy during the campaign season dramatically expanded in Wisconsin.
.....


&#x93;The Commission concludes that, in each of these cases, the expenditures were clearly campaign-oriented activities.  They were quite clearly designed to influence the electoral process.  They were focused either on electing or defeating a candidate.  The Commission bases this conclusion on the following points:


&#x93;Although those paying for the activities claimed they were aimed solely at educating voters on the issues, they each mentioned the names of candidates for office.


&#x93;They occurred only when election races were in progress that involved a contest between an incumbent and a challenger.  When the election was over, the activities ended.


&#x93;The activity has occurred after legislative sessions when the issues about which advocacy was occurring were not being deliberated by the legislature.


&#x93;The activity occurred in campaign season, between the candidate&#x92;s filing for candidacy and election time.  Advertisements of this sort have tended to occur at virtually no other time.


&#x93;The activity involved the electronic media, mass mailings, or centrally located telephone banks.
.....


&#x93;The explosive growth of campaign-based advocacy, without even disclosure of its activities and funding sources, poses a grave risk to the integrity of elections. It has created a two-tiered campaign process: one, based in candidates and political parties, which is tightly regulated and controlled; the other, based in interest group activity under the guise of &#x91;issue advocacy&#x92; but actually quite clearly election-focused, which lies beyond accountability.&#x94;  1 Governor&#x92;s Blue-Ribbon Commission on Campaign Finance Reform, State of Wisconsin: Report of the Commission, available at http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-17" href="#ZD-17ref">17</a> The Chief Justice says that Buckley v. Valeo, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
 (per curiam), &#x93;already rejected&#x94; any test that calls for an assessment of the intent and effect of corporate electioneering.  Ante, at 13.  The &#x93;reject[ion]&#x94; to which The Chief Justice presumably refers is Buckley&#x92;s quotation of Thomas v. Collins, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/516" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 516</a> (1945)
, where we found impermissibly vague a statute that permitted a union leader to &#x93; &#x91;laud unionism&#x92; &#x94; but forbade him to &#x93;imply an invitation&#x94; to join a union.  Id., at 534.  The problem with this predicament, we reasoned, was the lack of a clearly permissible opportunity for expression:  Whether words &#x93;designed to fall short of invitation would miss that mark is a question both of intent and of effect,&#x94; and no speaker &#x93;safely could assume that anything he might say &#x2026; would not be understood by some as an invitation.&#x94;  Id., at 535.  We then specified that the speaker in Thomas was left with an impermissibly limited universe of &#x93;three choices: (1) to stand on his right and speak freely; (2) to quit, refusing entirely to speak; (3) to trim, and even thus to risk the penalty.&#x94;  Id., at 536.


The Chief Justice implies that considering the intent and effect of corporate advertising during as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203 would put corporations in precisely the same bind; thus, he wonders how McConnell could use the language of intent and effect without &#x93;even address[ing] what Buckley&#x94; (and by extension, Thomas) &#x93;had to say on the subject.&#x94;  Ante, at 14.  But one need not look far in our McConnell opinion to understand why we thought that corporations have more than the constrained set of options available to the union leader in Thomas.  Just a few sentences after holding that ads with electioneering intent and effect are regulable, we gave this explanation: &#x93;in the future corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads [shortly before an election] by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.  In other words, corporations can find refuge in constitutionally sufficient and clearly delineated safe harbors by modifying the content of their ads (by omitting a candidate&#x92;s name) or by altering the sources of their ads&#x92; financing (from general treasuries to PACs).  The Chief Justice thus wrongly jettisons our conclusions about the constitutionality of regulating ads with electioneering purpose; we meant what we said in McConnell, and we did not overlook 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence when we said it.  Whereas The Chief Justice says that BCRA &#x93;should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights,&#x94; ante, at 14, we already held in McConnell that the campaign finance law accomplishes precisely that.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-18" href="#ZD-18ref">18</a> The Chief Justice speculates that McConnell derived its test for functional equivalence from &#x93;[t]wo key studies,&#x94; ante, at 12, but not a shred of language in McConnell supports that theory.  In stating the legal standard, McConnell made no mention of any study.  What is the authority, then, for asserting that the studies were pivotal to the standard we announced in McConnell?  See ante, at 12.  Other than WRTL&#x92;s brief, The Chief Justice cites only Judge Henderson&#x92;s separate district court opinion in McConnell.  Ante, at 12.  But The Chief Justice quotes one part of Judge Henderson&#x92;s analysis and neglects to mention that she in turn was quoting the lead author of one of the studies in question: &#x93;According to the Brennan Center, the Buying Time reports were &#x91;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of&#x92; BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions &#x91;in support of their constitutional validity.&#x92; &#x94;  McConnell, 251 F.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-19" href="#ZD-19ref">19</a> Like the District Court, the only bit of context The Chief Justice would allow the reasonable listener is the congressional agenda: whether the &#x93; &#x91;issue&#x92; &#x94; addressed in an ad currently is, or soon will be, &#x93; &#x91;the subject of legislative scrutiny.&#x92; &#x94;  Ante, at 20 (quoting 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 207).  For example, The Chief Justice says, there would have been &#x93;no reason&#x94; to think that WRTL&#x92;s ad constituted anything but a pure issue ad if it addressed a bill pending during Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection campaign, such as the Universal National Service Act.  Ante, at 17.  It is revealing, of course, that The Chief Justice does not invoke the filibuster issue, the subject of WRTL&#x92;s ads, as the legislative matter with particular salience during the 2004 election.  But why the reasonable listener can look to Congress but not the calendar on the wall or a WRTL website is difficult to fathom.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-21" href="#ZD-21ref">21</a> These as-applied challenges provide no reason to second-guess our conclusion in McConnell that the rule for differentiating between electioneering ads and genuine issue ads is administrable.  WRTL&#x92;s ads clearly have an electioneering purpose and, as explained above, fall comfortably within the heartland of electioneering communications that &#xA7;203 may validly regulate.  Thus, although Justice Scalia claims that &#x93;[t]oday&#x92;s cases make it apparent&#x94; that McConnell must be overruled, ante, at 18, there is nothing about today&#x92;s cases that suggests that McConnell is unworkable.  We therefore have no occasion to reconsider McConnell from first principles.

        <p class="bodytext">    The significance and effect of today&#x92;s judgment, from which I respectfully dissent, turn on three things: the demand for campaign money in huge amounts from large contributors, whose power has produced a cynical electorate; the congressional recognition of the ensuing threat to democratic integrity as reflected in a century of legislation restricting the electoral leverage of concentrations of money in corporate and union treasuries; and <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensable ingredient of a political candidacy is money for advertising.  In the 2004 campaign, more than half of the combined expenditures by the two principal presidential candidates (excluding fundraising) went for media time and space.  See The Costliest Campaign, Washington Post, Dec. 30, 2004, p. A7.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>2</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And in the 2005&#x96;2006 election cycle, the expenditure of more than $2 billion on television shattered the previous record, even without a presidential contest.  See Inside Media, MediaWeek, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 18.  The portent is for still greater spending.  By the end of March 2007, almost a year before the first primary and more than 18 months before the general election, presidential candidates had already raised over $150 million.  See Balz, Fundraising Totals Challenge Early Campaign Assumptions, Washington Post, Apr. 17, 2007, p. A1 (citing figures and noting that &#x93;[t]he campaign is living up to its reputation as the most expensive in U. S. history&#x94;).  To reach this total, the leading fundraisers collected over $250,000 per day in the first quarter of 2007, Mullins, Clinton Leads the Money Race, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2007, p. A8, and the eventual nominees are expected to raise $500 million apiece (about $680,000 per day over a 2-year election cycle), Kirkpatrick and Pilhofer, McCain Lags in Income But Excels in Spending, Report Shows, N. Y. Times, Apr. 15, 2007, p. 20.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensability of these huge sums has two significant consequences for American Government that are particularly on point here.  The enormous demands, first, assign power to deep pockets.  See Balz, <em>supra</em>, at A6 (&#x93;For all the interest in Internet fundraising, big donors still ruled in the first quarter, with roughly 80 percent of donations coming in amounts of $1,000 or more&#x94;).  Candidates occasionally boast about the number of contributors they have, but the headlines speaking in dollars reflect political reality.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Mullins, <em>supra</em>, at A8 (headlined &#x93;Clinton Leads the Money Race&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Some major contributors get satisfaction from pitching in for their candidates, but political preference fails to account for the frequency of giving &#x93;substantial sums to <em>both</em> major national parties,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 148, a practice driven &#x93;by stark political pragmatism, not by ideological support for either party or their candidates,&#x94; Brief for Committee for Economic Development et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> in <em>McConnell</em>, O. T. 2003, No. 02&#x96;1674, p. 3 (hereinafter CED Brief).  What the high-dollar pragmatists of either variety get is special access to the officials they help elect, and with it a disproportionate influence on those in power.  See <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em/>at 130&#x96;131.  As the erstwhile officer of a large American corporation put it, &#x93; &#x91;[b]usiness leaders believe&#x97;based on experience and with good reason&#x97;that &#x2026; access gives them an opportunity to shape and affect governmental decisions and that their ability to do so derives from the fact that they have given large sums of money to the parties.&#x92; &#x94;  CED Brief 9.  At a critical level, contributions that underwrite elections are leverage for enormous political influence.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Voters know this.  Hence, the second important consequence of the demand for big money to finance publicity: pervasive public cynicism.  A 2002 poll found that 71 percent of Americans think Members of Congress cast votes based on the views of their big contributors, even when those views differ from the Member&#x92;s own beliefs about what is best for the country.  Mellman &amp; Wirthlin 267; see also <em>id.</em>, at 266 (&#x93;In public opinion research it is uncommon to have 70 percent or more of the public see an issue the same way.  When they do, it indicates an unusually strong agreement on that issue&#x94;).  The same percentage believes that the will of contributors tempts Members to vote against the majority view of their constituents.  <em>Id.</em>, at 267.  Almost half of Americans believe that Members often decide how to vote based on what big contributors to their party want, while only a quarter think Members often base their votes on perceptions of what is best for the country or their constituents.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Devoting concentrations of money in self-interested hands to the support of political campaigning therefore threatens the capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents and the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves.  These are the elements summed up in the notion of political integrity, giving it a value second to none in a free society.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the threat to this value flowing from concentrations of money in politics has reached an unprecedented enormity, it has been gathering force for generations.  Before the turn of the last century, as now, it was obvious that the purchase of influence and the cynicism of voters threaten the integrity and stability of democratic government, each derived from the responsiveness of its law to the interests of citizens and their confidence in that focus.  The danger has traditionally seemed at its apex when no reasonable limits constrain the campaign activities of organizations whose &#x93;unique legal and economic characteristics&#x94; are tailored to &#x93;facilitat[e] the amassing of large treasuries,&#x94; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>,

Corporations were the earliest subjects of concern; the same characteristics that have made them engines of the Nation&#x92;s extraordinary prosperity have given them the financial muscle to gain &#x93;advantage in the political marketplace&#x94; when they turn from core corporate activity to electioneering, <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em> v. <em>Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Thirty years later, new questions about the electoral influence of accumulated wealth surfaced as organized labor expanded during the New Deal.  In the 1936 election, labor unions contributed &#x93;unprecedented&#x94; sums, S. Rep. No. 151, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 127 (1937), the greater part of them by the United Mine Workers, see Campaign Finance Sourcebook 17.  And in due course reaction began to build: &#x93;[w]artime strikes gave rise to fears of the new concentration of power represented by the gains of trade unionism.  And so the belief grew that, just as the great corporations had made huge political contributions to influence governmental action &#x2026; , the powerful unions were pursuing a similar course, and with the same untoward consequences for the democratic process.&#x94;  <em>Automobile Workers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 578.  Congress responded with the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943, which extended the ban on corporate donations to labor organizations, ch. 144, &#xA7;9, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">57</a>Stat.
167&#x96;168, an extension that was made permanent in the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, better known as Taft-Hartley, &#xA7;304,

        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At the same time, Congress had another worry that foreshadows our case today.  It was concerned that the statutory prohibition on corporate &#x93;contribution[s]&#x94; was being so narrowly construed as to open a &#x93;loophole whereby corporations, national banks, and labor organizations are enabled to avoid the obviously intended restrictive policy of the statute by garbing their financial assistance in the form of an &#x91;expenditure&#x92; rather than a contribution.&#x94;  S. Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38&#x96;39 (1947); see also H. Rep. No. 2739, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 40 (1947) (&#x93;The intent and purpose of the provision of the act prohibiting any corporation or labor organization making any contribution in connection with any election would be wholly defeated if it were assumed that the term &#x91;making any contribution&#x92; related only to the donating of money directly to a candidate, and excluded the vast expenditures of money in the activities herein shown to be engaged in extensively.  Of what avail would a law be to prohibit the contributing direct to a candidate and yet permit the expenditure of large sums in his behalf?&#x94;).

        <p class="bodytext">    In 1986, in <em>MCFL</em>, we reexamined the longstanding ban on spending corporate and union treasury funds &#x93;in connection with&#x94; federal elections, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/441b.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;441b</a>, and drew two conclusions implicated in the present case.  First, we construed the &#x93;in connection with&#x94; phrase in much the same way we had interpreted comparable FECA language challenged in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)

        <p class="bodytext">    We thus held that the prohibition applied &#x93;only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 44.  &#x93;[E]xpress terms,&#x94; in turn, meant what had already become known as &#x93;magic words,&#x94; such as &#x93; &#x91;vote for,&#x92; &#x91;elect,&#x92; &#x91;support,&#x92; &#x91;cast your ballot for,&#x92; &#x91;Smith for Congress,&#x92; &#x91;vote against,&#x92; &#x91;defeat,&#x92; &#x91;reject.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>,<em/>n. 52.  The consequence of this construction was obvious: it pulled the teeth out of the statute, as we had understood when we announced it in its earlier application in Buckley:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness &#x2026; undermines the limitation&#x92;s effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or officeholder.  It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate&#x92;s campaign.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 45.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nor was the statute, even as thus narrowed, enforceable against the particular advocacy corporation challenging the limit in <em>MCFL</em>.  This was the second holding of <em>MCFL </em>relevant here;<em/>we explained that the congressional effort to limit the political influence of corporate money &#x93;has reflected concern not about use of the corporate form <em>per se</em>, but about the potential for unfair deployment of wealth for political purposes,&#x94; 479 U.

We held that this &#x93;legitima[te]&#x94; concern could not reasonably extend to electioneering expenditures by the corporation at issue in <em>MCFL</em>, which neither &#x93;engage[d] in business activities&#x94; nor accepted donations from business corporations and unions (and thus could not serve as a &#x93;condui[t]&#x94; for political spending by those entities).  <em>Id.</em>, at 263&#x96;264.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

L.

        <p class="bodytext">    An issue ad is an advertisement on a political subject urging the reader or listener to let a politician know what he thinks, but containing no magic words telling the recipient to vote for or against anyone.  By the 1996 election cycle, between $135 and $150 million was being devoted to these ads, see <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 127, n. 20, and because they had no magic words, they failed to trigger the limitation on union or corporate expenditures for electioneering.  Experience showed, however, just what we foresaw in <em>Buckley</em>, that the line between &#x93;issue&#x94; broadcasts and outright electioneering was a patent fiction, as in the example of a television &#x93;issue ad&#x94; that ran during a Montana congressional race between Republican Rick Hill and Democrat Bill Yellowtail in 1996:</p>

        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>McConnell</em>, we found this definition to be &#x93;easily understood and objectiv[e],&#x94; raising &#x93;none of the vagueness concerns that drove our analysis&#x94; of the statutory language at issue in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em>, 540 U. S., at 194, and we held that the resulting line separating regulated election speech from general political discourse does not, on its face, violate the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  We rejected any suggestion &#x93;that <em>Buckley</em> drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy [with magic words] and so-called issue advocacy [without them], and that speakers possess an inviolable 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to engage in the latter category of speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 190.  To the contrary, we held that &#x93;our decisions in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em> were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 192&#x96;193.  &#x93;[T]he presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech,&#x94; which is prohibitable, &#x93;from a true issue ad,&#x94; we said, since ads that &#x93;esche[w] the use of magic words &#x2026; are no less clearly intended to influence the election.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 193.  We thus found &#x93;[l]ittle difference &#x2026; between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We understood that Congress had a compelling interest in limiting this sort of electioneering by corporations and unions, for &#xA7;203 exemplified a tradition of &#x93;repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660).  Nor did we see any plausible claim of substantial overbreadth from incidentally prohibiting ads genuinely focused on issues rather than elections, given the limitation of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; by time, geographical coverage, and clear reference to candidate.  &#x93;Far from establishing that BCRA&#x92;s application to pure issue ads is substantial, either in an absolute sense or relative to its application to election-related advertising, the record strongly supports the contrary conclusion.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 207.  Finally, we underscored the reasonableness of the &#xA7;203 line by emphasizing that it defined a category of limited, but not prohibited, corporate and union speech: &#x93;Because corporations can still fund electioneering communications with PAC money, it is &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression rather than a regulation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 204 (quoting <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em> v. <em>Beaumont</em>,

).  Thus &#x93;corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads [in the runup period] by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated [PAC] fund.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We may add that a nonprofit corporation, no matter what its source of funding, is free to pelt a federal candidate like Jane Doe with criticism or shower her with praise, by name and within days of an election, if it speaks through a newspaper ad or on a website, rather than a &#x93;broadcast, cable, or satellite communication,&#x94;

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, Congress in 1907 prohibited corporate contributions to candidates and in 1943 applied the same ban to unions.  In 1947, Congress extended the complete ban from contributions to expenditures &#x93;in connection with&#x94; an election, a phrase so vague that in 1986 we held it must be confined to instances of express advocacy using magic words.  Congress determined, in 2002, that corporate and union expenditures for fake issue ads devoid of magic words should be regulated using a narrow definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; to reach only broadcast ads that were the practical equivalents of express advocacy.  In 2003, this Court found the provision free from vagueness and justified by the concern that drove its enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This century-long tradition of legislation and judicial precedent rests on facing undeniable facts and testifies to an equally undeniable value.  Campaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries, with no redolence of &#x93;grassroots&#x94; about them.  Neither Congress&#x92;s decisions nor our own have understood the corrupting influence of money in politics as being limited to outright bribery or discrete <em>quid pro quo; </em>campaign finance reform has instead consistently focused on the more pervasive distortion of electoral institutions by concentrated wealth, on the special access and guaranteed favor that sap the representative integrity of American government and defy public confidence in its institutions.  From early in the 20th century through the decision in <em>McConnell</em>, we have acknowledged that the value of democratic integrity justifies a realistic response when corporations and labor organizations commit the concentrated moneys in their treasuries to electioneering.</p>

During the 1998 campaign, for example, WRTL&#x92;s PAC spent $60,000 to oppose him.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In 2004, however, despite a sharp nationwide increase in PAC receipts, WRTL focused its fundraising on its corporate treasury, not the PAC, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;43, and took in only $17,000 in PAC contributions, as against over $150,000 during 2000, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;42.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Throughout the 2004 senatorial campaign, WRTL made no secret of its views about who should win the election and explicitly tied its position to the filibuster issue.  Its PAC issued at least two press releases saying that its &#x93;Top Election Priorities&#x94; were to &#x93;Re-elect George W. Bush&#x94; and &#x93;Send Feingold Packing!&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 78&#x96;80, 82&#x96;84.  In one of these, the Chair of WRTL&#x92;s PAC was quoted as saying, &#x93; &#x91;We do not want Russ Feingold to continue to have the ability to thwart President Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 82&#x96;83.  The Spring 2004 issue of the WRTL PAC&#x92;s quarterly magazine ran an article headlined &#x93;Radically Pro-Abortion Feingold Must Go!&#x94;, which reported that &#x93;Feingold has been active in his opposition to Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees&#x94; and said that &#x93;the defeat of Feingold must be uppermost in the minds of Wisconsin&#x92;s pro-life community in the 2004 elections.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 101&#x96;103.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    It was under these circumstances that WRTL ran the three television and radio ads in question.  The bills for them were not paid by WRTL&#x92;s PAC, but out of the general treasury with its substantial proportion of corporate contributions; in fact, corporations earmarked more than $50,000 specifically to pay for the ads, <em>id.</em>, at 41.

A visit to this website would erase any doubt a listener or viewer might have as to whether Senators Feingold and Kohl were part of the &#x93;group&#x94; condemned in the ads: it displayed a document that criticized the two Senators for voting to filibuster &#x93;16 out of 16 times&#x94; and accused them of &#x93;putting politics into the court system, creating gridlock, and costing taxpayers money.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 86.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL&#x92;s planned airing of the ads had no apparent relation to any Senate filibuster vote but was keyed to the timing of the senatorial election.

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, any Wisconsin voter who paid attention would have known that Democratic Senator Feingold supported filibusters against Republican presidential judicial nominees, that the propriety of the filibusters was a major issue in the senatorial campaign, and that WRTL along with the Senator&#x92;s Republican challengers opposed his reelection because of his position on filibusters.  Any alert voters who heard or saw WRTL&#x92;s ads would have understood that WRTL was telling them that the Senator&#x92;s position on the filibusters should be grounds to vote against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given these facts, it is beyond all reasonable debate that the ads are constitutionally subject to regulation under <em>McConnell</em>.  There, we noted that BCRA was meant to remedy the problem of &#x93;[s]o-called issue ads&#x94; being used &#x93;to advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 126.  We then gave a paradigmatic example of these electioneering ads subject to regulation, saying that &#x93;[l]ittle difference existed . . . between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The WRTL ads were indistinguishable from the Jane Doe ad; they &#x93;condemned [Senator Feingold&#x92;s] record on a particular issue&#x94; and exhorted the public to contact him and &#x93;tell [him] what you think.&#x94;<a name="ZD-16ref" href="#ZD-16" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  And just as anyone who heard the Jane Doe ad would understand that the point was to defeat Doe, anyone who heard the Feingold ads (let alone anyone who went to the website they named) would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.  If it is now unconstitutional to restrict WRTL&#x92;s Feingold ads, then it follows that &#xA7;203 can no longer be applied constitutionally to <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>Jane Doe paradigm.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding that &#xA7;203 is facially constitutional is overruled.  By what steps does the principal opinion reach this unacknowledged result less than four years after <em>McConnell</em> was decided?</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, it lays down a new test to identify a severely limited class of ads that may constitutionally be regulated as electioneering communications, a test that is flatly contrary to <em>McConnell</em>.  An ad is the equivalent of express advocacy and subject to regulation, the opinion says, only if it is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Since the Feingold ads could, in isolation, be read as at least including calls to communicate views on filibusters to the two Senators, those ads cannot be treated as the functional equivalent of express advocacy to elect or defeat anyone, and therefore may not constitutionally be regulated at all.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the same could have been said of the hypothetical Jane Doe ad.  Its spoken message ended with the instruction to tell Doe what the voter thinks.  The same could also have been said of the actual Yellowtail ad.  Yet in <em>McConnell</em>, we gave the Jane Doe ad as the paradigm of a broadcast message that could be constitutionally regulated as election conduct, and we explicitly described the Yellowtail ad as a &#x93;striking example&#x94; of one that was &#x93;clearly intended to influence the election,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 193, and n. 78.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The principal opinion, in other words, simply inverts what we said in <em>McConnell</em>.  While we left open the possibility of a &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure&#x94; issue ad that might not be open to regulation under &#xA7;203, <em>id.</em>, at 206&#x96;207, and n. 88, we meant that an issue ad without campaign advocacy could escape the restriction.  The implication of the adjectives &#x93;genuine&#x94; and &#x93;pure&#x94; is unmistakable: if an ad is reasonably understood as going beyond a discussion of issues (that is, if it can be understood as electoral advocacy), then by definition it is not &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure.&#x94;  But the principal opinion inexplicably wrings the opposite conclusion from those words: if an ad is susceptible to any &#x93;reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; then it must be a &#x93;pure&#x94; or &#x93;genuine&#x94; issue ad.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  This stands <em>McConnell</em> on its head, and on this reasoning it is pos-<span class="softbreak"/>sible that even some ads with magic words could not be regulated.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Second, the principal opinion seems to defend this inversion of <em>McConnell</em> as a necessary alternative to an unadministrable subjective test for the equivalence of express (and regulable) electioneering advocacy.  The principal opinion acknowledges, of course, that in <em>McConnell</em> we said that &#x93;[t]he justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during [the period shortly before an election] if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.  But <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> says that statement in <em>McConnell</em> cannot be accepted at face value because we could not, consistent with precedent, have focused our 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> enquiry on whether &#x93;the speaker actually intended to affect an election.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.<a name="ZD-17ref" href="#ZD-17" class="">

            <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> suggests it is more likely that the <em>McConnell</em> opinion inadvertently borrowed the language of &#x93;intended &#x2026; effect[s],&#x94; 540 U.

        <p class="bodytext">    If <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> were correct that <em>McConnell</em> made the constitutional application of &#xA7;203 contingent on whether a corporation&#x92;s &#x93;motives were pure,&#x94; or its issue advocacy &#x93;subjective[ly] sincer[e],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted), then I, too, might be inclined to reconsider <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s language.  But <em>McConnell</em> did not do that.  It did not purport to draw constitutional lines based on the subjective motivations of corporations (or their principals) sponsoring political ads, but merely described our test for equivalence to express advocacy as resting on the ads&#x92; &#x93;electioneering purpose,&#x94; which will be objectively apparent from those ads&#x92; content and context (as these cases and the examples cited in <em>McConnell </em>readily show).  We therefore held that &#xA7;203 was not substantially overbroad because &#x93;the vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose,&#x94; and consequently could be regulated consistent with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  540 U. S., at 206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, if the studies to which <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> refers were now to inform our reading of <em>McConnell</em>, they would merely underscore the objective character of the proper way to determine whether &#xA7;203 is constitutional as applied to a given ad.  The authors of those studies did not conduct discovery of the &#x93;actua[l] inten[tions],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14, behind any ads; nor, to my knowledge, were the sponsors of campaign ads summoned before researchers to explain their motivations.  The studies merely confirmed that &#x93;reasonable people are &#x2026; able to discern between ads whose primary purpose is to support a candidate and those intended to provide information about a policy issue.&#x94;  J. Krasno &amp; D. Seltz, Buying Time: Television Advertising in the 1998 Congressional Elections 9 (2000).  To be clear, I am not endorsing the precise methodology of those studies (and <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> is correct that we did not do so in <em>McConnell</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13, n. 4); the point is only that the studies relied on a &#x93;reasonable&#x94; person&#x92;s understanding of the ads&#x92; apparent purpose, and thus were no less objective than <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s own approach.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A similarly mistaken fear of an unadministrable and speech-chilling subjective regime seems to underlie <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice&#x92;</span>s unwillingness to acknowledge the part that consideration of an ad&#x92;s context necessarily plays in any realistic assessment of its meaning.  A reasonable Wisconsinite watching or listening to WRTL&#x92;s ads would likely ask and answer some obvious questions about their circumstances.  Is the group that sponsors these ads the same one publicly campaigning against Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection?  <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> says that this information is &#x93;beside the point,&#x94; because WRTL&#x92;s history of overt electioneering only &#x93;goes to [its] subjective intent.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Did these &#x93;issue&#x94; ads begin appearing on the air during the election season, rather than at the time the filibuster &#x93;issue&#x94; was in fact being debated in the Senate?  This, too, is said to be irrelevant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  And does the website to which WRTL&#x92;s ads direct viewers contain material expressly advocating Senator Feingold&#x92;s defeat?  This enquiry is dismissed as being &#x93;one step removed from the text of the ads themselves.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  But these questions are central to the meaning of the ads, and any reasonable person would take account of circumstances in coming to understand the object of WRTL&#x92;s ad.  And why not?  Each of the contextual facts here can be established by an objective look at a public record; none requires a voter (or a litigant) to engage in discovery of evidence about WRTL&#x92;s operations or internal communications, and none goes to a hidden state of mind.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This refusal to see and hear what any listener to WRTL&#x92;s ads would actually consider produces a rule no different in practice from the one adopted by the District Court, which declined to look beyond the &#x93;four corners&#x94; of the ads themselves.  466 F. Supp. 2d 195, 207 (DC 2006).  Although <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> ostensibly stops short of categorically foreclosing consideration of context, see <em>ante</em>, at 20, the application of his test here makes it difficult to see how relevant contextual evidence could ever be taken into account the way it was in <em>McConnell</em>,<a name="ZD-19ref" href="#ZD-19" class="">

        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Third, it may be that the principal opinion rejects <em>McConnell </em>on the erroneous assumption that &#xA7;203 flatly bans independent electioneering communications by a corporation.  <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> argues that corporations must receive &#x93;the benefit of any doubt,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16,<em/>whenever we undertake the task of &#x93;separating &#x2026; political speech protected under the

But this is a fundamental misconception of the task at hand:  we have already held that it is &#x93; &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression,&#x94; because PAC financing provides corporations &#x93;with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy.&#x94;<a name="ZD-20ref" href="#ZD-20" class="">

            <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 203&#x96;204 (quoting <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 162).  Thus, a successful as-applied challenger to &#xA7;203 should necessarily show, at the least, that it could not constitutionally be subjected to the administrative rules that govern a PAC&#x92;s formation and operation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 163.  This would be an uphill fight, after our repeated affirmations that the PAC structure does not impose excessive burdens, <em>ibid.</em> (citing <em>National Right to Work Comm.</em>, 459 U. S., at 201&#x96;202), and WRTL has a particularly weak position on this point: it set up its own PAC long before the 2004 election, used it to campaign openly against Senator Feingold in the past, and could have raised noncorporate donations to it in the 2004 election cycle.  Any argument that establishing and maintaining a PAC is unconstitutionally burdensome for WRTL would thus likely be futile, and certainly should not prevail on WRTL&#x92;s summary judgment motion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, even without the PAC alternative, it would be untrue that &#xA7;203 &#x93;banned&#x94; WRTL from saying anything a genuine issue ad would say, for WRTL could have availed itself of either or both of the following additional options.  It is undisputed that WRTL&#x92;s ads could have been broadcast lawfully in the runup to the election (and bankrolled from WRTL&#x92;s general treasury) if Senator Feingold&#x92;s name had been omitted and the Senator not otherwise singled out.  Since members of today&#x92;s majority apparently view WRTL&#x92;s broadcasts either as &#x93;genuine issue ad[s],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16 (opinion of <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>), or as &#x93;lobby[ing] Wisconsin voters concerning the filibustering of the President&#x92;s judicial nominees,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 2 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.,</span> concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a claim that omitting Senator Feingold&#x92;s name would &#x93;ban&#x94; WRTL&#x92;s message is specious.  Yet one searches my Brothers&#x92; opinions in vain for any persuasive reason why substituting the phrase &#x93;Contact your Senators&#x94; for the phrase &#x93;Contact Senators Feingold and Kohl&#x94; would have denied WRTL a constitutionally sufficient (and clearly lawful) alternative way to send its message.  If WRTL is to be believed when it claims that the issue was the point of the ads, it would have lost nothing by referring simply to the &#x93;Senators.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the suggestion that &#xA7;203 is a ban on political speech is belied by <em>MCFL</em>&#x92;s safe harbor for nonprofit advocacy corporations: under that rule, WRTL would have been free to attack Senator Feingold by name at any time with ads funded from its corporate treasury, if it had not also chosen to serve as a funnel for hundreds of thousands of dollars from other corporations.  Thus, what is called a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech is a limit on the financing of electioneering broadcasts by entities that refuse to take advantage of the PAC structure but insist on acting as conduits from the campaign war chests of business corporations.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, <em>McConnell</em> does not graft a subjective standard onto campaign regulation, the context of campaign advertising cannot sensibly be ignored, and &#xA7;203 is not a ban on speech.  What cannot be gainsaid, in any event, is that in treating these subjects as it does, the operative opinion produces the result of overruling <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding on &#xA7;203, less than four years in the Reports.  Anyone who doubts that need merely ask what the law would have been if, back in 2003, this Court had held &#xA7;203 facially unconstitutional.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    BCRA&#x92;s definition of &#x93;electioneering communication,&#x94; which identifies the communications regulable under &#xA7;203, includes a backup to be used if the primary definition &#x93;is held to be constitutionally insufficient by final judicial decision to support the regulation provided herein.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_A_ii" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(A)(ii)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If this should occur, &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; is to be defined as </p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This backup sounds familiar because it is essentially identical to <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s test for evaluating an as-applied challenge to the original definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94;: regulation is permissible only if the communication is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16.  Thus does the principal opinion institute the very standard that would have prevailed if the Court formally overruled <em>McConnell</em>.  There is neither a theoretical nor a practical basis to claim that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s treatment of &#xA7;203 survives.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">E</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The price of <em>McConnell&#x92;</em>s<em/>demise as authority on &#xA7;203 seems to me to be a high one.  The Court (and, I think, the country) loses when important precedent is overruled without good reason, and there is no justification for departing from our usual rule of <em>stare decisis</em> here.  The same combination of alternatives that was available to corporations affected by <em>McConnell</em> in 2003 is available today: WRTL could have run a newspaper ad, could have paid for the broadcast ads through its PAC, could have established itself as an <em>MCFL</em> organization free of corporate money, and could have said &#x93;call your Senators&#x94; instead of naming Senator Feingold in its ads broadcasted just before the election.  Nothing in the related law surrounding &#xA7;203 has changed in any way, let alone in any way that undermines <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>rationale.

            </a>  Although WRTL contends that the as-applied remedy has proven to be &#x93;[i]nadequate&#x94; because such challenges cannot be litigated quickly enough to avoid being mooted, Brief for Appellee 65&#x96;66, nothing prevents an advertiser from obtaining a preliminary injunction if it can qualify for one, and WRTL does not point to any evidence that district courts have been unable to rule on any such matters in a timely way.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, it goes without saying that nothing has changed about the facts.  In Justice Frankfurter&#x92;s words, they demonstrate a threat to &#x93;the integrity of our electoral process,&#x94; <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 570, which for a century now Congress has repeatedly found to be imperiled by corporate, and later union, money: witness the Tillman Act, Taft-Hartley, FECA, and BCRA.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  <em>McConnell </em>was our latest decision vindicating clear and reasonable boundaries that Congress has drawn to limit &#x93; &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth,&#x92; &#x94; 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660), and the decision could claim the justification of ongoing fact as well as decisional history in recognizing Congress&#x92;s authority to protect the integrity of elections from the distortion of corporate and union funds.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After today, the ban on contributions by corporations and unions and the limitation on their corrosive spending when they enter the political arena are open to easy circumvention, and the possibilities for regulating corporate and union campaign money are unclear.  The ban on contributions will mean nothing much, now that companies and unions can save candidates the expense of advertising directly, simply by running &#x93;issue ads&#x94; without express advocacy, or by funneling the money through an independent corporation like WRTL.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the understanding of the voters and the Congress that this kind of corporate and union spending seriously jeopardizes the integrity of democratic government will remain.  The facts are too powerful to be ignored, and further efforts at campaign finance reform will come.  It is only the legal landscape that now is altered, and it may be that today&#x92;s departure from precedent will drive further reexamination of the constitutional analysis: of the distinction between contributions and expenditures, or the relation between spending and speech, which have given structure to our thinking since <em>Buckley</em> itself was decided.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    I cannot tell what the future will force upon us, but I respectfully dissent from this judgment today.</p>

With respect to judicial elections, a context in which the influence of campaign contributions is most troubling, a recent poll of business leaders revealed that about four in five thought that campaign contributions have at least &#x93;some influence&#x94; on judges&#x92; decisions, while 90 percent are at least &#x93;somewhat concerned&#x94; that &#x93;[c]ampaign contributions and political pressure will make judges accountable to politicians and special interest groups instead of the law and the Constitution.&#x94;  Zogby International, Attitudes and Views of American Business Leaders on State Judicial Elections and Political Contributions to Judges 4&#x96;5 (May 2007), available at http://www.ced.org/docs/report/report_2007judicial_survey.pdf.

Bellotti, however, concerned corporate spending in connection with a referendum, and we went out of our way in that case to avoid casting any doubt upon the constitutionality of limiting corporate expenditures during candidate elections.  We said:


&#x93;The overriding concern behind the enactment of [the federal restrictions on corporate contributions and expenditures] was the problem of corruption of elected representatives through the creation of political debts.  The importance of the governmental interest in preventing this occurrence has never been doubted.  The case before us presents no comparable problem, and our consideration of a corporation&#x92;s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.  Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.&#x94;  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26 (citations omitted).


Eight years before Austin, we unanimously reaffirmed that Bellotti &#x93;specifically pointed out that in elections of candidates to public office, unlike in referenda on issues of general public interest, there may well be a threat of real or apparent corruption.&#x94;  Federal Election Comm&#x92;n v.

So Austin did not &#x93;stra[y]&#x94; from Bellotti, ante, at 7 (opinion of Scalia, J.); the reasons Bellotti was not controlling in Austin had been clearly foreshadowed in Bellotti itself and confirmed repeatedly in our decisions leading up to Austin.

&#x93;Especially beginning in 1996, issue advocacy during the campaign season dramatically expanded in Wisconsin.
.....


&#x93;The Commission concludes that, in each of these cases, the expenditures were clearly campaign-oriented activities.  They were quite clearly designed to influence the electoral process.  They were focused either on electing or defeating a candidate.  The Commission bases this conclusion on the following points:


&#x93;Although those paying for the activities claimed they were aimed solely at educating voters on the issues, they each mentioned the names of candidates for office.


&#x93;They occurred only when election races were in progress that involved a contest between an incumbent and a challenger.  When the election was over, the activities ended.


&#x93;The activity has occurred after legislative sessions when the issues about which advocacy was occurring were not being deliberated by the legislature.


&#x93;The activity occurred in campaign season, between the candidate&#x92;s filing for candidacy and election time.  Advertisements of this sort have tended to occur at virtually no other time.


&#x93;The activity involved the electronic media, mass mailings, or centrally located telephone banks.
.....


&#x93;The explosive growth of campaign-based advocacy, without even disclosure of its activities and funding sources, poses a grave risk to the integrity of elections. It has created a two-tiered campaign process: one, based in candidates and political parties, which is tightly regulated and controlled; the other, based in interest group activity under the guise of &#x91;issue advocacy&#x92; but actually quite clearly election-focused, which lies beyond accountability.&#x94;  1 Governor&#x92;s Blue-Ribbon Commission on Campaign Finance Reform, State of Wisconsin: Report of the Commission, available at http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
 (per curiam), &#x93;already rejected&#x94; any test that calls for an assessment of the intent and effect of corporate electioneering.  Ante, at 13.  The &#x93;reject[ion]&#x94; to which The Chief Justice presumably refers is Buckley&#x92;s quotation of Thomas v. Collins, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/516" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 516</a> (1945)
, where we found impermissibly vague a statute that permitted a union leader to &#x93; &#x91;laud unionism&#x92; &#x94; but forbade him to &#x93;imply an invitation&#x94; to join a union.  Id., at 534.  The problem with this predicament, we reasoned, was the lack of a clearly permissible opportunity for expression:  Whether words &#x93;designed to fall short of invitation would miss that mark is a question both of intent and of effect,&#x94; and no speaker &#x93;safely could assume that anything he might say &#x2026; would not be understood by some as an invitation.&#x94;  Id., at 535.  We then specified that the speaker in Thomas was left with an impermissibly limited universe of &#x93;three choices: (1) to stand on his right and speak freely; (2) to quit, refusing entirely to speak; (3) to trim, and even thus to risk the penalty.&#x94;  Id., at 536.


The Chief Justice implies that considering the intent and effect of corporate advertising during as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203 would put corporations in precisely the same bind; thus, he wonders how McConnell could use the language of intent and effect without &#x93;even address[ing] what Buckley&#x94; (and by extension, Thomas) &#x93;had to say on the subject.&#x94;  Ante, at 14.  But one need not look far in our McConnell opinion to understand why we thought that corporations have more than the constrained set of options available to the union leader in Thomas.  Just a few sentences after holding that ads with electioneering intent and effect are regulable, we gave this explanation: &#x93;in the future corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads [shortly before an election] by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.  In other words, corporations can find refuge in constitutionally sufficient and clearly delineated safe harbors by modifying the content of their ads (by omitting a candidate&#x92;s name) or by altering the sources of their ads&#x92; financing (from general treasuries to PACs).  The Chief Justice thus wrongly jettisons our conclusions about the constitutionality of regulating ads with electioneering purpose; we meant what we said in McConnell, and we did not overlook 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence when we said it.  Whereas The Chief Justice says that BCRA &#x93;should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights,&#x94; ante, at 14, we already held in McConnell that the campaign finance law accomplishes precisely that.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-18" href="#ZD-18ref">18</a> The Chief Justice speculates that McConnell derived its test for functional equivalence from &#x93;[t]wo key studies,&#x94; ante, at 12, but not a shred of language in McConnell supports that theory.  In stating the legal standard, McConnell made no mention of any study.  What is the authority, then, for asserting that the studies were pivotal to the standard we announced in McConnell?  See ante, at 12.  Other than WRTL&#x92;s brief, The Chief Justice cites only Judge Henderson&#x92;s separate district court opinion in McConnell.  Ante, at 12.  But The Chief Justice quotes one part of Judge Henderson&#x92;s analysis and neglects to mention that she in turn was quoting the lead author of one of the studies in question: &#x93;According to the Brennan Center, the Buying Time reports were &#x91;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of&#x92; BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions &#x91;in support of their constitutional validity.&#x92; &#x94;  McConnell, 251 F.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-19" href="#ZD-19ref">19</a> Like the District Court, the only bit of context The Chief Justice would allow the reasonable listener is the congressional agenda: whether the &#x93; &#x91;issue&#x92; &#x94; addressed in an ad currently is, or soon will be, &#x93; &#x91;the subject of legislative scrutiny.&#x92; &#x94;  Ante, at 20 (quoting 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 207).  For example, The Chief Justice says, there would have been &#x93;no reason&#x94; to think that WRTL&#x92;s ad constituted anything but a pure issue ad if it addressed a bill pending during Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection campaign, such as the Universal National Service Act.  Ante, at 17.  It is revealing, of course, that The Chief Justice does not invoke the filibuster issue, the subject of WRTL&#x92;s ads, as the legislative matter with particular salience during the 2004 election.  But why the reasonable listener can look to Congress but not the calendar on the wall or a WRTL website is difficult to fathom.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-20" href="#ZD-20ref">20</a>Justice Scalia also adopts the same misconception that &#xA7;203 is a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech.  See ante, at 18 (&#x93;Section 203&#x92;s line is bright, but it bans vast amounts of political advocacy indistinguishable from hitherto protected speech&#x94;).
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-21" href="#ZD-21ref">21</a> These as-applied challenges provide no reason to second-guess our conclusion in McConnell that the rule for differentiating between electioneering ads and genuine issue ads is administrable.  WRTL&#x92;s ads clearly have an electioneering purpose and, as explained above, fall comfortably within the heartland of electioneering communications that &#xA7;203 may validly regulate.  Thus, although Justice Scalia claims that &#x93;[t]oday&#x92;s cases make it apparent&#x94; that McConnell must be overruled, ante, at 18, there is nothing about today&#x92;s cases that suggests that McConnell is unworkable.  We therefore have no occasion to reconsider McConnell from first principles.

        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensable ingredient of a political candidacy is money for advertising.  In the 2004 campaign, more than half of the combined expenditures by the two principal presidential candidates (excluding fundraising) went for media time and space.

            </a>  And in the 2005&#x96;2006 election cycle, the expenditure of more than $2 billion on television shattered the previous record, even without a presidential contest.  See Inside Media, MediaWeek, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 18.  The portent is for still greater spending.  By the end of March 2007, almost a year before the first primary and more than 18 months before the general election, presidential candidates had already raised over $150 million.  See Balz, Fundraising Totals Challenge Early Campaign Assumptions, Washington Post, Apr. 17, 2007, p. A1 (citing figures and noting that &#x93;[t]he campaign is living up to its reputation as the most expensive in U. S. history&#x94;).  To reach this total, the leading fundraisers collected over $250,000 per day in the first quarter of 2007, Mullins, Clinton Leads the Money Race, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2007, p. A8, and the eventual nominees are expected to raise $500 million apiece (about $680,000 per day over a 2-year election cycle), Kirkpatrick and Pilhofer, McCain Lags in Income But Excels in Spending, Report Shows, N. Y. Times, Apr. 15, 2007, p. 20.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensability of these huge sums has two significant consequences for American Government that are particularly on point here.  The enormous demands, first, assign power to deep pockets.  See Balz, <em>supra</em>, at A6 (&#x93;For all the interest in Internet fundraising, big donors still ruled in the first quarter, with roughly 80 percent of donations coming in amounts of $1,000 or more&#x94;).  Candidates occasionally boast about the number of contributors they have, but the headlines speaking in dollars reflect political reality.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Mullins, <em>supra</em>, at A8 (headlined &#x93;Clinton Leads the Money Race&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Some major contributors get satisfaction from pitching in for their candidates, but political preference fails to account for the frequency of giving &#x93;substantial sums to <em>both</em> major national parties,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U.

See <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em/>at 130&#x96;131.  As the erstwhile officer of a large American corporation put it, &#x93; &#x91;[b]usiness leaders believe&#x97;based on experience and with good reason&#x97;that &#x2026; access gives them an opportunity to shape and affect governmental decisions and that their ability to do so derives from the fact that they have given large sums of money to the parties.&#x92; &#x94;  CED Brief 9.

        <p class="bodytext">    Voters know this.  Hence, the second important consequence of the demand for big money to finance publicity: pervasive public cynicism.  A 2002 poll found that 71 percent of Americans think Members of Congress cast votes based on the views of their big contributors, even when those views differ from the Member&#x92;s own beliefs about what is best for the country.  Mellman &amp; Wirthlin 267; see also <em>id.</em>, at 266 (&#x93;In public opinion research it is uncommon to have 70 percent or more of the public see an issue the same way.  When they do, it indicates an unusually strong agreement on that issue&#x94;).  The same percentage believes that the will of contributors tempts Members to vote against the majority view of their constituents.  <em>Id.</em>, at 267.  Almost half of Americans believe that Members often decide how to vote based on what big contributors to their party want, while only a quarter think Members often base their votes on perceptions of what is best for the country or their constituents.

        <p class="bodytext">    At the same time, Congress had another worry that foreshadows our case today.  It was concerned that the statutory prohibition on corporate &#x93;contribution[s]&#x94; was being so narrowly construed as to open a &#x93;loophole whereby corporations, national banks, and labor organizations are enabled to avoid the obviously intended restrictive policy of the statute by garbing their financial assistance in the form of an &#x91;expenditure&#x92; rather than a contribution.&#x94;  S. Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38&#x96;39 (1947); see also H. Rep.

Of what avail would a law be to prohibit the contributing direct to a candidate and yet permit the expenditure of large sums in his behalf?&#x94;).

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/441b.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;441b</a>, and drew two conclusions implicated in the present case.  First, we construed the &#x93;in connection with&#x94; phrase in much the same way we had interpreted comparable FECA language challenged in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)

        <p class="bodytext">    We thus held that the prohibition applied &#x93;only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 44.  &#x93;[E]xpress terms,&#x94; in turn, meant what had already become known as &#x93;magic words,&#x94; such as &#x93; &#x91;vote for,&#x92; &#x91;elect,&#x92; &#x91;support,&#x92; &#x91;cast your ballot for,&#x92; &#x91;Smith for Congress,&#x92; &#x91;vote against,&#x92; &#x91;defeat,&#x92; &#x91;reject.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>,<em/>n. 52.  The consequence of this construction was obvious: it pulled the teeth out of the statute, as we had understood when we announced it in its earlier application in Buckley:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness &#x2026; undermines the limitation&#x92;s effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or officeholder.  It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate&#x92;s campaign.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 45.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nor was the statute, even as thus narrowed, enforceable against the particular advocacy corporation challenging the limit in <em>MCFL</em>.  This was the second holding of <em>MCFL </em>relevant here;<em/>we explained that the congressional effort to limit the political influence of corporate money &#x93;has reflected concern not about use of the corporate form <em>per se</em>, but about the potential for unfair deployment of wealth for political purposes,&#x94; 479 U.

We held that this &#x93;legitima[te]&#x94; concern could not reasonably extend to electioneering expenditures by the corporation at issue in <em>MCFL</em>, which neither &#x93;engage[d] in business activities&#x94; nor accepted donations from business corporations and unions (and thus could not serve as a &#x93;condui[t]&#x94; for political spending by those entities).  <em>Id.</em>, at 263&#x96;264.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

Experience showed, however, just what we foresaw in <em>Buckley</em>, that the line between &#x93;issue&#x94; broadcasts and outright electioneering was a patent fiction, as in the example of a television &#x93;issue ad&#x94; that ran during a Montana congressional race between Republican Rick Hill and Democrat Bill Yellowtail in 1996:</p>

To the contrary, we held that &#x93;our decisions in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em> were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 192&#x96;193.  &#x93;[T]he presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech,&#x94; which is prohibitable, &#x93;from a true issue ad,&#x94; we said, since ads that &#x93;esche[w] the use of magic words &#x2026; are no less clearly intended to influence the election.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 193.  We thus found &#x93;[l]ittle difference &#x2026; between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We understood that Congress had a compelling interest in limiting this sort of electioneering by corporations and unions, for &#xA7;203 exemplified a tradition of &#x93;repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U.

Nor did we see any plausible claim of substantial overbreadth from incidentally prohibiting ads genuinely focused on issues rather than elections, given the limitation of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; by time, geographical coverage, and clear reference to candidate.  &#x93;Far from establishing that BCRA&#x92;s application to pure issue ads is substantial, either in an absolute sense or relative to its application to election-related advertising, the record strongly supports the contrary conclusion.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 207.  Finally, we underscored the reasonableness of the &#xA7;203 line by emphasizing that it defined a category of limited, but not prohibited, corporate and union speech: &#x93;Because corporations can still fund electioneering communications with PAC money, it is &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression rather than a regulation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 204 (quoting <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em> v. <em>Beaumont</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    We may add that a nonprofit corporation, no matter what its source of funding, is free to pelt a federal candidate like Jane Doe with criticism or shower her with praise, by name and within days of an election, if it speaks through a newspaper ad or on a website, rather than a &#x93;broadcast, cable, or satellite communication,&#x94;

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, Congress in 1907 prohibited corporate contributions to candidates and in 1943 applied the same ban to unions.  In 1947, Congress extended the complete ban from contributions to expenditures &#x93;in connection with&#x94; an election, a phrase so vague that in 1986 we held it must be confined to instances of express advocacy using magic words.  Congress determined, in 2002, that corporate and union expenditures for fake issue ads devoid of magic words should be regulated using a narrow definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; to reach only broadcast ads that were the practical equivalents of express advocacy.  In 2003, this Court found the provision free from vagueness and justified by the concern that drove its enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This century-long tradition of legislation and judicial precedent rests on facing undeniable facts and testifies to an equally undeniable value.  Campaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries, with no redolence of &#x93;grassroots&#x94; about them.  Neither Congress&#x92;s decisions nor our own have understood the corrupting influence of money in politics as being limited to outright bribery or discrete <em>quid pro quo; </em>campaign finance reform has instead consistently focused on the more pervasive distortion of electoral institutions by concentrated wealth, on the special access and guaranteed favor that sap the representative integrity of American government and defy public confidence in its institutions.  From early in the 20th century through the decision in <em>McConnell</em>, we have acknowledged that the value of democratic integrity justifies a realistic response when corporations and labor organizations commit the concentrated moneys in their treasuries to electioneering.</p>

            </a>  In 2004, WRTL accepted over $315,000 in corporate donations, App. 40, and of its six general fund contributions of $50,000 or more between 2002 and 2005, three, including the largest (for $140,000), came from corporate donors, <em>id.</em>, at 118&#x96;121.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL also runs a PAC, funded by individual donations, which has been active over the years in making independent campaign expenditures, as in the previous two elections involving Senator Feingold.  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  During the 1998 campaign, for example, WRTL&#x92;s PAC spent $60,000 to oppose him.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In 2004, however, despite a sharp nationwide increase in PAC receipts, WRTL focused its fundraising on its corporate treasury, not the PAC, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;43, and took in only $17,000 in PAC contributions, as against over $150,000 during 2000, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;42.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Throughout the 2004 senatorial campaign, WRTL made no secret of its views about who should win the election and explicitly tied its position to the filibuster issue.  Its PAC issued at least two press releases saying that its &#x93;Top Election Priorities&#x94; were to &#x93;Re-elect George W. Bush&#x94; and &#x93;Send Feingold Packing!&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 78&#x96;80, 82&#x96;84.  In one of these, the Chair of WRTL&#x92;s PAC was quoted as saying, &#x93; &#x91;We do not want Russ Feingold to continue to have the ability to thwart President Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 82&#x96;83.  The Spring 2004 issue of the WRTL PAC&#x92;s quarterly magazine ran an article headlined &#x93;Radically Pro-Abortion Feingold Must Go!&#x94;, which reported that &#x93;Feingold has been active in his opposition to Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees&#x94; and said that &#x93;the defeat of Feingold must be uppermost in the minds of Wisconsin&#x92;s pro-life community in the 2004 elections.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 101&#x96;103.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    It was under these circumstances that WRTL ran the three television and radio ads in question.  The bills for them were not paid by WRTL&#x92;s PAC, but out of the general treasury with its substantial proportion of corporate contributions; in fact, corporations earmarked more than $50,000 specifically to pay for the ads, <em>id.</em>, at 41.  Each one criticized an unnamed &#x93;group of Senators&#x94; for &#x93;using the filibuster delay tactic to block federal judicial nominees from a simple &#x91;yes&#x92; or &#x91;no&#x92; vote,&#x94; and described the Senators&#x92; actions as &#x93;politics at work, causing gridlock and backing up some of our courts to a state of emergency.&#x94;<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>  They exhorted viewers and listeners to &#x93;[c]ontact Senators Feingold and Kohl and tell them to oppose the filibuster,&#x94; but instead of providing a phone number or e-mail address, they told the audience to go to BeFair.org, a website set up by WRTL.  A visit to this website would erase any doubt a listener or viewer might have as to whether Senators Feingold and Kohl were part of the &#x93;group&#x94; condemned in the ads: it displayed a document that criticized the two Senators for voting to filibuster &#x93;16 out of 16 times&#x94; and accused them of &#x93;putting politics into the court system, creating gridlock, and costing taxpayers money.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 86.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL&#x92;s planned airing of the ads had no apparent relation to any Senate filibuster vote but was keyed to the timing of the senatorial election.  WRTL began broadcasting the ads on July 26, 2004, four days after the Senate recessed for the summer, and although the filibuster controversy raged on through 2005, WRTL did not resume running the ads after the election.  <em>Id.</em>, at 29, 32.  During the campaign period that the ads did cover, Senator Feingold&#x92;s support of the filibusters was a prominent issue.  His position was well known,<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, any Wisconsin voter who paid attention would have known that Democratic Senator Feingold supported filibusters against Republican presidential judicial nominees, that the propriety of the filibusters was a major issue in the senatorial campaign, and that WRTL along with the Senator&#x92;s Republican challengers opposed his reelection because of his position on filibusters.  Any alert voters who heard or saw WRTL&#x92;s ads would have understood that WRTL was telling them that the Senator&#x92;s position on the filibusters should be grounds to vote against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given these facts, it is beyond all reasonable debate that the ads are constitutionally subject to regulation under <em>McConnell</em>.  There, we noted that BCRA was meant to remedy the problem of &#x93;[s]o-called issue ads&#x94; being used &#x93;to advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 126.  We then gave a paradigmatic example of these electioneering ads subject to regulation, saying that &#x93;[l]ittle difference existed . . . between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The WRTL ads were indistinguishable from the Jane Doe ad; they &#x93;condemned [Senator Feingold&#x92;s] record on a particular issue&#x94; and exhorted the public to contact him and &#x93;tell [him] what you think.&#x94;<a name="ZD-16ref" href="#ZD-16" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>16</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And just as anyone who heard the Jane Doe ad would understand that the point was to defeat Doe, anyone who heard the Feingold ads (let alone anyone who went to the website they named) would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.  If it is now unconstitutional to restrict WRTL&#x92;s Feingold ads, then it follows that &#xA7;203 can no longer be applied constitutionally to <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>Jane Doe paradigm.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding that &#xA7;203 is facially constitutional is overruled.  By what steps does the principal opinion reach this unacknowledged result less than four years after <em>McConnell</em> was decided?</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, it lays down a new test to identify a severely limited class of ads that may constitutionally be regulated as electioneering communications, a test that is flatly contrary to <em>McConnell</em>.  An ad is the equivalent of express advocacy and subject to regulation, the opinion says, only if it is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Since the Feingold ads could, in isolation, be read as at least including calls to communicate views on filibusters to the two Senators, those ads cannot be treated as the functional equivalent of express advocacy to elect or defeat anyone, and therefore may not constitutionally be regulated at all.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the same could have been said of the hypothetical Jane Doe ad.  Its spoken message ended with the instruction to tell Doe what the voter thinks.  The same could also have been said of the actual Yellowtail ad.  Yet in <em>McConnell</em>, we gave the Jane Doe ad as the paradigm of a broadcast message that could be constitutionally regulated as election conduct, and we explicitly described the Yellowtail ad as a &#x93;striking example&#x94; of one that was &#x93;clearly intended to influence the election,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 193, and n. 78.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The principal opinion, in other words, simply inverts what we said in <em>McConnell</em>.  While we left open the possibility of a &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure&#x94; issue ad that might not be open to regulation under &#xA7;203, <em>id.</em>, at 206&#x96;207, and n. 88, we meant that an issue ad without campaign advocacy could escape the restriction.  The implication of the adjectives &#x93;genuine&#x94; and &#x93;pure&#x94; is unmistakable: if an ad is reasonably understood as going beyond a discussion of issues (that is, if it can be understood as electoral advocacy), then by definition it is not &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure.&#x94;  But the principal opinion inexplicably wrings the opposite conclusion from those words: if an ad is susceptible to any &#x93;reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; then it must be a &#x93;pure&#x94; or &#x93;genuine&#x94; issue ad.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  This stands <em>McConnell</em> on its head, and on this reasoning it is pos-<span class="softbreak"/>sible that even some ads with magic words could not be regulated.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Second, the principal opinion seems to defend this inversion of <em>McConnell</em> as a necessary alternative to an unadministrable subjective test for the equivalence of express (and regulable) electioneering advocacy.  The principal opinion acknowledges, of course, that in <em>McConnell</em> we said that &#x93;[t]he justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during [the period shortly before an election] if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;  540 U.

But <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> says that statement in <em>McConnell</em> cannot be accepted at face value because we could not, consistent with precedent, have focused our

But <em>McConnell</em> did not do that.  It did not purport to draw constitutional lines based on the subjective motivations of corporations (or their principals) sponsoring political ads, but merely described our test for equivalence to express advocacy as resting on the ads&#x92; &#x93;electioneering purpose,&#x94; which will be objectively apparent from those ads&#x92; content and context (as these cases and the examples cited in <em>McConnell </em>readily show).  We therefore held that &#xA7;203 was not substantially overbroad because &#x93;the vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose,&#x94; and consequently could be regulated consistent with the

        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, if the studies to which <span class="smallcaps">The</span>

The authors of those studies did not conduct discovery of the &#x93;actua[l] inten[tions],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14, behind any ads; nor, to my knowledge, were the sponsors of campaign ads summoned before researchers to explain their motivations.  The studies merely confirmed that &#x93;reasonable people are &#x2026; able to discern between ads whose primary purpose is to support a candidate and those intended to provide information about a policy issue.&#x94;  J.

To be clear, I am not endorsing the precise methodology of those studies (and <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> is correct that we did not do so in <em>McConnell</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13, n. 4); the point is only that the studies relied on a &#x93;reasonable&#x94; person&#x92;s understanding of the ads&#x92; apparent purpose, and thus were no less objective than <span class="smallcaps">The</span>

A reasonable Wisconsinite watching or listening to WRTL&#x92;s ads would likely ask and answer some obvious questions about their circumstances.  Is the group that sponsors these ads the same one publicly campaigning against Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection?  <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> says that this information is &#x93;beside the point,&#x94; because WRTL&#x92;s history of overt electioneering only &#x93;goes to [its] subjective intent.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Did these &#x93;issue&#x94; ads begin appearing on the air during the election season, rather than at the time the filibuster &#x93;issue&#x94; was in fact being debated in the Senate?  This, too, is said to be irrelevant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  And does the website to which WRTL&#x92;s ads direct viewers contain material expressly advocating Senator Feingold&#x92;s defeat?  This enquiry is dismissed as being &#x93;one step removed from the text of the ads themselves.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  But these questions are central to the meaning of the ads, and any reasonable person would take account of circumstances in coming to understand the object of WRTL&#x92;s ad.  And why not?  Each of the contextual facts here can be established by an objective look at a public record; none requires a voter (or a litigant) to engage in discovery of evidence about WRTL&#x92;s operations or internal communications, and none goes to a hidden state of mind.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This refusal to see and hear what any listener to WRTL&#x92;s ads would actually consider produces a rule no different in practice from the one adopted by the District Court, which declined to look beyond the &#x93;four corners&#x94; of the ads themselves.  466 F.

S., at 201&#x96;202), and WRTL has a particularly weak position on this point: it set up its own PAC long before the 2004 election, used it to campaign openly against Senator Feingold in the past, and could have raised noncorporate donations to it in the 2004 election cycle.  Any argument that establishing and maintaining a PAC is unconstitutionally burdensome for WRTL would thus likely be futile, and certainly should not prevail on WRTL&#x92;s summary judgment motion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, even without the PAC alternative, it would be untrue that &#xA7;203 &#x93;banned&#x94; WRTL from saying anything a genuine issue ad would say, for WRTL could have availed itself of either or both of the following additional options.  It is undisputed that WRTL&#x92;s ads could have been broadcast lawfully in the runup to the election (and bankrolled from WRTL&#x92;s general treasury) if Senator Feingold&#x92;s name had been omitted and the Senator not otherwise singled out.  Since members of today&#x92;s majority apparently view WRTL&#x92;s broadcasts either as &#x93;genuine issue ad[s],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16 (opinion of <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>), or as &#x93;lobby[ing] Wisconsin voters concerning the filibustering of the President&#x92;s judicial nominees,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 2 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.,</span> concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a claim that omitting Senator Feingold&#x92;s name would &#x93;ban&#x94; WRTL&#x92;s message is specious.  Yet one searches my Brothers&#x92; opinions in vain for any persuasive reason why substituting the phrase &#x93;Contact your Senators&#x94; for the phrase &#x93;Contact Senators Feingold and Kohl&#x94; would have denied WRTL a constitutionally sufficient (and clearly lawful) alternative way to send its message.  If WRTL is to be believed when it claims that the issue was the point of the ads, it would have lost nothing by referring simply to the &#x93;Senators.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the suggestion that &#xA7;203 is a ban on political speech is belied by <em>MCFL</em>&#x92;s safe harbor for nonprofit advocacy corporations: under that rule, WRTL would have been free to attack Senator Feingold by name at any time with ads funded from its corporate treasury, if it had not also chosen to serve as a funnel for hundreds of thousands of dollars from other corporations.  Thus, what is called a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech is a limit on the financing of electioneering broadcasts by entities that refuse to take advantage of the PAC structure but insist on acting as conduits from the campaign war chests of business corporations.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, <em>McConnell</em> does not graft a subjective standard onto campaign regulation, the context of campaign advertising cannot sensibly be ignored, and &#xA7;203 is not a ban on speech.  What cannot be gainsaid, in any event, is that in treating these subjects as it does, the operative opinion produces the result of overruling <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding on &#xA7;203, less than four years in the Reports.  Anyone who doubts that need merely ask what the law would have been if, back in 2003, this Court had held &#xA7;203 facially unconstitutional.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    BCRA&#x92;s definition of &#x93;electioneering communication,&#x94; which identifies the communications regulable under &#xA7;203, includes a backup to be used if the primary definition &#x93;is held to be constitutionally insufficient by final judicial decision to support the regulation provided herein.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_A_ii" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(A)(ii)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If this should occur, &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; is to be defined as </p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This backup sounds familiar because it is essentially identical to <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s test for evaluating an as-applied challenge to the original definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94;: regulation is permissible only if the communication is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16.  Thus does the principal opinion institute the very standard that would have prevailed if the Court formally overruled <em>McConnell</em>.  There is neither a theoretical nor a practical basis to claim that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s treatment of &#xA7;203 survives.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">E</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The price of <em>McConnell&#x92;</em>s<em/>demise as authority on &#xA7;203 seems to me to be a high one.  The Court (and, I think, the country) loses when important precedent is overruled without good reason, and there is no justification for departing from our usual rule of <em>stare decisis</em> here.  The same combination of alternatives that was available to corporations affected by <em>McConnell</em> in 2003 is available today: WRTL could have run a newspaper ad, could have paid for the broadcast ads through its PAC, could have established itself as an <em>MCFL</em> organization free of corporate money, and could have said &#x93;call your Senators&#x94; instead of naming Senator Feingold in its ads broadcasted just before the election.  Nothing in the related law surrounding &#xA7;203 has changed in any way, let alone in any way that undermines <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>rationale.  See <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>,

.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nor can any serious argument be made that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding has been &#x93;unworkable in practice.&#x94;  <em>Allied-Signal, Inc.</em> v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation</em>,

            </a>  Although WRTL contends that the as-applied remedy has proven to be &#x93;[i]nadequate&#x94; because such challenges cannot be litigated quickly enough to avoid being mooted, Brief for Appellee 65&#x96;66, nothing prevents an advertiser from obtaining a preliminary injunction if it can qualify for one, and WRTL does not point to any evidence that district courts have been unable to rule on any such matters in a timely way.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, it goes without saying that nothing has changed about the facts.  In Justice Frankfurter&#x92;s words, they demonstrate a threat to &#x93;the integrity of our electoral process,&#x94; <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 570, which for a century now Congress has repeatedly found to be imperiled by corporate, and later union, money: witness the Tillman Act, Taft-Hartley, FECA, and BCRA.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  <em>McConnell </em>was our latest decision vindicating clear and reasonable boundaries that Congress has drawn to limit &#x93; &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth,&#x92; &#x94; 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660), and the decision could claim the justification of ongoing fact as well as decisional history in recognizing Congress&#x92;s authority to protect the integrity of elections from the distortion of corporate and union funds.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After today, the ban on contributions by corporations and unions and the limitation on their corrosive spending when they enter the political arena are open to easy circumvention, and the possibilities for regulating corporate and union campaign money are unclear.  The ban on contributions will mean nothing much, now that companies and unions can save candidates the expense of advertising directly, simply by running &#x93;issue ads&#x94; without express advocacy, or by funneling the money through an independent corporation like WRTL.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the understanding of the voters and the Congress that this kind of corporate and union spending seriously jeopardizes the integrity of democratic government will remain.  The facts are too powerful to be ignored, and further efforts at campaign finance reform will come.  It is only the legal landscape that now is altered, and it may be that today&#x92;s departure from precedent will drive further reexamination of the constitutional analysis: of the distinction between contributions and expenditures, or the relation between spending and speech, which have given structure to our thinking since <em>Buckley</em> itself was decided.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    I cannot tell what the future will force upon us, but I respectfully dissent from this judgment today.</p>

Justice Scalia asserts that Austin &#x93;strayed far from&#x94; the principles we announced in First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/435/765" class="subref" title="subref">435 U. S. 765</a> (1978)
.  Ante, at 7 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Bellotti, however, concerned corporate spending in connection with a referendum, and we went out of our way in that case to avoid casting any doubt upon the constitutionality of limiting corporate expenditures during candidate elections.  We said:


&#x93;The overriding concern behind the enactment of [the federal restrictions on corporate contributions and expenditures] was the problem of corruption of elected representatives through the creation of political debts.  The importance of the governmental interest in preventing this occurrence has never been doubted.  The case before us presents no comparable problem, and our consideration of a corporation&#x92;s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.  Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.&#x94;  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26 (citations omitted).


Eight years before Austin, we unanimously reaffirmed that Bellotti &#x93;specifically pointed out that in elections of candidates to public office, unlike in referenda on issues of general public interest, there may well be a threat of real or apparent corruption.&#x94;  Federal Election Comm&#x92;n v.

Then, four years later, in MCFL, we also noted that an expenditure limit offering corporations a PAC alternative is &#x93;distinguishable from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for political speech&#x94; that we addressed in Bellotti.  479 U. S., at 259, n. 12.  So Austin did not &#x93;stra[y]&#x94; from Bellotti, ante, at 7 (opinion of Scalia, J.); the reasons Bellotti was not controlling in Austin had been clearly foreshadowed in Bellotti itself and confirmed repeatedly in our decisions leading up to Austin.

&#x93;Especially beginning in 1996, issue advocacy during the campaign season dramatically expanded in Wisconsin.
.....


&#x93;The Commission concludes that, in each of these cases, the expenditures were clearly campaign-oriented activities.  They were quite clearly designed to influence the electoral process.  They were focused either on electing or defeating a candidate.  The Commission bases this conclusion on the following points:


&#x93;Although those paying for the activities claimed they were aimed solely at educating voters on the issues, they each mentioned the names of candidates for office.


&#x93;They occurred only when election races were in progress that involved a contest between an incumbent and a challenger.  When the election was over, the activities ended.


&#x93;The activity has occurred after legislative sessions when the issues about which advocacy was occurring were not being deliberated by the legislature.


&#x93;The activity occurred in campaign season, between the candidate&#x92;s filing for candidacy and election time.  Advertisements of this sort have tended to occur at virtually no other time.


&#x93;The activity involved the electronic media, mass mailings, or centrally located telephone banks.
.....


&#x93;The explosive growth of campaign-based advocacy, without even disclosure of its activities and funding sources, poses a grave risk to the integrity of elections. It has created a two-tiered campaign process: one, based in candidates and political parties, which is tightly regulated and controlled; the other, based in interest group activity under the guise of &#x91;issue advocacy&#x92; but actually quite clearly election-focused, which lies beyond accountability.&#x94;  1 Governor&#x92;s Blue-Ribbon Commission on Campaign Finance Reform, State of Wisconsin: Report of the Commission, available at http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm.

But one need not look far in our McConnell opinion to understand why we thought that corporations have more than the constrained set of options available to the union leader in Thomas.  Just a few sentences after holding that ads with electioneering intent and effect are regulable, we gave this explanation: &#x93;in the future corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads [shortly before an election] by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.  In other words, corporations can find refuge in constitutionally sufficient and clearly delineated safe harbors by modifying the content of their ads (by omitting a candidate&#x92;s name) or by altering the sources of their ads&#x92; financing (from general treasuries to PACs).  The Chief Justice thus wrongly jettisons our conclusions about the constitutionality of regulating ads with electioneering purpose; we meant what we said in McConnell, and we did not overlook 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence when we said it.  Whereas The Chief Justice says that BCRA &#x93;should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights,&#x94; ante, at 14, we already held in McConnell that the campaign finance law accomplishes precisely that.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-18" href="#ZD-18ref">18</a> The Chief Justice speculates that McConnell derived its test for functional equivalence from &#x93;[t]wo key studies,&#x94; ante, at 12, but not a shred of language in McConnell supports that theory.  In stating the legal standard, McConnell made no mention of any study.  What is the authority, then, for asserting that the studies were pivotal to the standard we announced in McConnell?  See ante, at 12.  Other than WRTL&#x92;s brief, The Chief Justice cites only Judge Henderson&#x92;s separate district court opinion in McConnell.  Ante, at 12.  But The Chief Justice quotes one part of Judge Henderson&#x92;s analysis and neglects to mention that she in turn was quoting the lead author of one of the studies in question: &#x93;According to the Brennan Center, the Buying Time reports were &#x91;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of&#x92; BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions &#x91;in support of their constitutional validity.&#x92; &#x94;  McConnell, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 307&#x96;308 (opinion of Henderson, J.) (italics in original) (quoting deposition of Craig P. Holman, principal co-author of Buying Time 2000: Television Advertising in the 2000 Federal Elections (Brennan Center 2001)).

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-19" href="#ZD-19ref">19</a> Like the District Court, the only bit of context The Chief Justice would allow the reasonable listener is the congressional agenda: whether the &#x93; &#x91;issue&#x92; &#x94; addressed in an ad currently is, or soon will be, &#x93; &#x91;the subject of legislative scrutiny.&#x92; &#x94;  Ante, at 20 (quoting 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 207).  For example, The Chief Justice says, there would have been &#x93;no reason&#x94; to think that WRTL&#x92;s ad constituted anything but a pure issue ad if it addressed a bill pending during Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection campaign, such as the Universal National Service Act.  Ante, at 17.  It is revealing, of course, that The Chief Justice does not invoke the filibuster issue, the subject of WRTL&#x92;s ads, as the legislative matter with particular salience during the 2004 election.  But why the reasonable listener can look to Congress but not the calendar on the wall or a WRTL website is difficult to fathom.

See ante, at 18 (&#x93;Section 203&#x92;s line is bright, but it bans vast amounts of political advocacy indistinguishable from hitherto protected speech&#x94;).

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-21" href="#ZD-21ref">21</a> These as-applied challenges provide no reason to second-guess our conclusion in McConnell that the rule for differentiating between electioneering ads and genuine issue ads is administrable.  WRTL&#x92;s ads clearly have an electioneering purpose and, as explained above, fall comfortably within the heartland of electioneering communications that &#xA7;203 may validly regulate.  Thus, although Justice Scalia claims that &#x93;[t]oday&#x92;s cases make it apparent&#x94; that McConnell must be overruled, ante, at 18, there is nothing about today&#x92;s cases that suggests that McConnell is unworkable.  We therefore have no occasion to reconsider McConnell from first principles.

        <p class="bodytext">    The significance and effect of today&#x92;s judgment, from which I respectfully dissent, turn on three things: the demand for campaign money in huge amounts from large contributors, whose power has produced a cynical electorate; the congressional recognition of the ensuing threat to democratic integrity as reflected in a century of legislation restricting the electoral leverage of concentrations of money in corporate and union treasuries; and <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensable ingredient of a political candidacy is money for advertising.  In the 2004 campaign, more than half of the combined expenditures by the two principal presidential candidates (excluding fundraising) went for media time and space.  See The Costliest Campaign, Washington Post, Dec. 30, 2004, p. A7.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>2</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And in the 2005&#x96;2006 election cycle, the expenditure of more than $2 billion on television shattered the previous record, even without a presidential contest.  See Inside Media, MediaWeek, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 18.  The portent is for still greater spending.  By the end of March 2007, almost a year before the first primary and more than 18 months before the general election, presidential candidates had already raised over $150 million.  See Balz, Fundraising Totals Challenge Early Campaign Assumptions, Washington Post, Apr. 17, 2007, p. A1 (citing figures and noting that &#x93;[t]he campaign is living up to its reputation as the most expensive in U. S. history&#x94;).  To reach this total, the leading fundraisers collected over $250,000 per day in the first quarter of 2007, Mullins, Clinton Leads the Money Race, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2007, p. A8, and the eventual nominees are expected to raise $500 million apiece (about $680,000 per day over a 2-year election cycle), Kirkpatrick and Pilhofer, McCain Lags in Income But Excels in Spending, Report Shows, N. Y. Times, Apr. 15, 2007, p. 20.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensability of these huge sums has two significant consequences for American Government that are particularly on point here.  The enormous demands, first, assign power to deep pockets.  See Balz, <em>supra</em>, at A6 (&#x93;For all the interest in Internet fundraising, big donors still ruled in the first quarter, with roughly 80 percent of donations coming in amounts of $1,000 or more&#x94;).  Candidates occasionally boast about the number of contributors they have, but the headlines speaking in dollars reflect political reality.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Mullins, <em>supra</em>, at A8 (headlined &#x93;Clinton Leads the Money Race&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Some major contributors get satisfaction from pitching in for their candidates, but political preference fails to account for the frequency of giving &#x93;substantial sums to <em>both</em> major national parties,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 148, a practice driven &#x93;by stark political pragmatism, not by ideological support for either party or their candidates,&#x94; Brief for Committee for Economic Development et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> in <em>McConnell</em>, O. T. 2003, No. 02&#x96;1674, p. 3 (hereinafter CED Brief).  What the high-dollar pragmatists of either variety get is special access to the officials they help elect, and with it a disproportionate influence on those in power.  See <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em/>at 130&#x96;131.  As the erstwhile officer of a large American corporation put it, &#x93; &#x91;[b]usiness leaders believe&#x97;based on experience and with good reason&#x97;that &#x2026; access gives them an opportunity to shape and affect governmental decisions and that their ability to do so derives from the fact that they have given large sums of money to the parties.&#x92; &#x94;  CED Brief 9.  At a critical level, contributions that underwrite elections are leverage for enormous political influence.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Voters know this.  Hence, the second important consequence of the demand for big money to finance publicity: pervasive public cynicism.  A 2002 poll found that 71 percent of Americans think Members of Congress cast votes based on the views of their big contributors, even when those views differ from the Member&#x92;s own beliefs about what is best for the country.  Mellman &amp; Wirthlin 267; see also <em>id.</em>, at 266 (&#x93;In public opinion research it is uncommon to have 70 percent or more of the public see an issue the same way.  When they do, it indicates an unusually strong agreement on that issue&#x94;).  The same percentage believes that the will of contributors tempts Members to vote against the majority view of their constituents.  <em>Id.</em>, at 267.  Almost half of Americans believe that Members often decide how to vote based on what big contributors to their party want, while only a quarter think Members often base their votes on perceptions of what is best for the country or their constituents.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Devoting concentrations of money in self-interested hands to the support of political campaigning therefore threatens the capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents and the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves.  These are the elements summed up in the notion of political integrity, giving it a value second to none in a free society.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the threat to this value flowing from concentrations of money in politics has reached an unprecedented enormity, it has been gathering force for generations.  Before the turn of the last century, as now, it was obvious that the purchase of influence and the cynicism of voters threaten the integrity and stability of democratic government, each derived from the responsiveness of its law to the interests of citizens and their confidence in that focus.  The danger has traditionally seemed at its apex when no reasonable limits constrain the campaign activities of organizations whose &#x93;unique legal and economic characteristics&#x94; are tailored to &#x93;facilitat[e] the amassing of large treasuries,&#x94; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Thirty years later, new questions about the electoral influence of accumulated wealth surfaced as organized labor expanded during the New Deal.  In the 1936 election, labor unions contributed &#x93;unprecedented&#x94; sums, S. Rep. No. 151, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 127 (1937), the greater part of them by the United Mine Workers, see Campaign Finance Sourcebook 17.  And in due course reaction began to build: &#x93;[w]artime strikes gave rise to fears of the new concentration of power represented by the gains of trade unionism.  And so the belief grew that, just as the great corporations had made huge political contributions to influence governmental action &#x2026; , the powerful unions were pursuing a similar course, and with the same untoward consequences for the democratic process.&#x94;  <em>Automobile Workers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 578.  Congress responded with the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943, which extended the ban on corporate donations to labor organizations, ch. 144, &#xA7;9, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">57</a>Stat.
167&#x96;168, an extension that was made permanent in the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, better known as Taft-Hartley, &#xA7;304,

        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At the same time, Congress had another worry that foreshadows our case today.  It was concerned that the statutory prohibition on corporate &#x93;contribution[s]&#x94; was being so narrowly construed as to open a &#x93;loophole whereby corporations, national banks, and labor organizations are enabled to avoid the obviously intended restrictive policy of the statute by garbing their financial assistance in the form of an &#x91;expenditure&#x92; rather than a contribution.&#x94;  S. Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38&#x96;39 (1947); see also H. Rep. No. 2739, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 40 (1947) (&#x93;The intent and purpose of the provision of the act prohibiting any corporation or labor organization making any contribution in connection with any election would be wholly defeated if it were assumed that the term &#x91;making any contribution&#x92; related only to the donating of money directly to a candidate, and excluded the vast expenditures of money in the activities herein shown to be engaged in extensively.  Of what avail would a law be to prohibit the contributing direct to a candidate and yet permit the expenditure of large sums in his behalf?&#x94;).  Taft-Hartley therefore extended the prohibition to any &#x93;contribution or expenditure&#x94; by a corporation or a union &#x93;in connection with&#x94; a federal election.  &#xA7;304,

        <p class="bodytext">    The new law left open, however, the right of a union to spend money on electioneering from a segregated fund raised specifically for that purpose from members, but not drawn from the general treasury.  Segregated funding entities, the now-familiar political action committees or PACs, had been established prior to Taft-Hartley, and we concluded in <em>Pipefitters</em> v. <em>United States</em>,

First, we construed the &#x93;in connection with&#x94; phrase in much the same way we had interpreted comparable FECA language challenged in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)

        <p class="bodytext">    We thus held that the prohibition applied &#x93;only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U.

It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate&#x92;s campaign.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 45.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    An issue ad is an advertisement on a political subject urging the reader or listener to let a politician know what he thinks, but containing no magic words telling the recipient to vote for or against anyone.  By the 1996 election cycle, between $135 and $150 million was being devoted to these ads, see <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 127, n. 20, and because they had no magic words, they failed to trigger the limitation on union or corporate expenditures for electioneering.  Experience showed, however, just what we foresaw in <em>Buckley</em>, that the line between &#x93;issue&#x94; broadcasts and outright electioneering was a patent fiction, as in the example of a television &#x93;issue ad&#x94; that ran during a Montana congressional race between Republican Rick Hill and Democrat Bill Yellowtail in 1996:</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>McConnell</em>, we found this definition to be &#x93;easily understood and objectiv[e],&#x94; raising &#x93;none of the vagueness concerns that drove our analysis&#x94; of the statutory language at issue in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em>, 540 U.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  We rejected any suggestion &#x93;that <em>Buckley</em> drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy [with magic words] and so-called issue advocacy [without them], and that speakers possess an inviolable 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to engage in the latter category of speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 190.  To the contrary, we held that &#x93;our decisions in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em> were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 192&#x96;193.  &#x93;[T]he presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech,&#x94; which is prohibitable, &#x93;from a true issue ad,&#x94; we said, since ads that &#x93;esche[w] the use of magic words &#x2026; are no less clearly intended to influence the election.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 193.  We thus found &#x93;[l]ittle difference &#x2026; between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We understood that Congress had a compelling interest in limiting this sort of electioneering by corporations and unions, for &#xA7;203 exemplified a tradition of &#x93;repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U.

Nor did we see any plausible claim of substantial overbreadth from incidentally prohibiting ads genuinely focused on issues rather than elections, given the limitation of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; by time, geographical coverage, and clear reference to candidate.  &#x93;Far from establishing that BCRA&#x92;s application to pure issue ads is substantial, either in an absolute sense or relative to its application to election-related advertising, the record strongly supports the contrary conclusion.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 207.  Finally, we underscored the reasonableness of the &#xA7;203 line by emphasizing that it defined a category of limited, but not prohibited, corporate and union speech: &#x93;Because corporations can still fund electioneering communications with PAC money, it is &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression rather than a regulation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 204 (quoting <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em> v. <em>Beaumont</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    We may add that a nonprofit corporation, no matter what its source of funding, is free to pelt a federal candidate like Jane Doe with criticism or shower her with praise, by name and within days of an election, if it speaks through a newspaper ad or on a website, rather than a &#x93;broadcast, cable, or satellite communication,&#x94;

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, Congress in 1907 prohibited corporate contributions to candidates and in 1943 applied the same ban to unions.  In 1947, Congress extended the complete ban from contributions to expenditures &#x93;in connection with&#x94; an election, a phrase so vague that in 1986 we held it must be confined to instances of express advocacy using magic words.  Congress determined, in 2002, that corporate and union expenditures for fake issue ads devoid of magic words should be regulated using a narrow definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; to reach only broadcast ads that were the practical equivalents of express advocacy.  In 2003, this Court found the provision free from vagueness and justified by the concern that drove its enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This century-long tradition of legislation and judicial precedent rests on facing undeniable facts and testifies to an equally undeniable value.  Campaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries, with no redolence of &#x93;grassroots&#x94; about them.  Neither Congress&#x92;s decisions nor our own have understood the corrupting influence of money in politics as being limited to outright bribery or discrete <em>quid pro quo; </em>campaign finance reform has instead consistently focused on the more pervasive distortion of electoral institutions by concentrated wealth, on the special access and guaranteed favor that sap the representative integrity of American government and defy public confidence in its institutions.  From early in the 20th century through the decision in <em>McConnell</em>, we have acknowledged that the value of democratic integrity justifies a realistic response when corporations and labor organizations commit the concentrated moneys in their treasuries to electioneering.</p>

            </a>  In 2004, WRTL accepted over $315,000 in corporate donations, App. 40, and of its six general fund contributions of $50,000 or more between 2002 and 2005, three, including the largest (for $140,000), came from corporate donors, <em>id.</em>, at 118&#x96;121.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL also runs a PAC, funded by individual donations, which has been active over the years in making independent campaign expenditures, as in the previous two elections involving Senator Feingold.  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  During the 1998 campaign, for example, WRTL&#x92;s PAC spent $60,000 to oppose him.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In 2004, however, despite a sharp nationwide increase in PAC receipts, WRTL focused its fundraising on its corporate treasury, not the PAC, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;43, and took in only $17,000 in PAC contributions, as against over $150,000 during 2000, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;42.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Throughout the 2004 senatorial campaign, WRTL made no secret of its views about who should win the election and explicitly tied its position to the filibuster issue.  Its PAC issued at least two press releases saying that its &#x93;Top Election Priorities&#x94; were to &#x93;Re-elect George W. Bush&#x94; and &#x93;Send Feingold Packing!&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 78&#x96;80, 82&#x96;84.  In one of these, the Chair of WRTL&#x92;s PAC was quoted as saying, &#x93; &#x91;We do not want Russ Feingold to continue to have the ability to thwart President Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 82&#x96;83.  The Spring 2004 issue of the WRTL PAC&#x92;s quarterly magazine ran an article headlined &#x93;Radically Pro-Abortion Feingold Must Go!&#x94;, which reported that &#x93;Feingold has been active in his opposition to Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees&#x94; and said that &#x93;the defeat of Feingold must be uppermost in the minds of Wisconsin&#x92;s pro-life community in the 2004 elections.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 101&#x96;103.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    It was under these circumstances that WRTL ran the three television and radio ads in question.  The bills for them were not paid by WRTL&#x92;s PAC, but out of the general treasury with its substantial proportion of corporate contributions; in fact, corporations earmarked more than $50,000 specifically to pay for the ads, <em>id.</em>, at 41.  Each one criticized an unnamed &#x93;group of Senators&#x94; for &#x93;using the filibuster delay tactic to block federal judicial nominees from a simple &#x91;yes&#x92; or &#x91;no&#x92; vote,&#x94; and described the Senators&#x92; actions as &#x93;politics at work, causing gridlock and backing up some of our courts to a state of emergency.&#x94;<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>  They exhorted viewers and listeners to &#x93;[c]ontact Senators Feingold and Kohl and tell them to oppose the filibuster,&#x94; but instead of providing a phone number or e-mail address, they told the audience to go to BeFair.org, a website set up by WRTL.  A visit to this website would erase any doubt a listener or viewer might have as to whether Senators Feingold and Kohl were part of the &#x93;group&#x94; condemned in the ads: it displayed a document that criticized the two Senators for voting to filibuster &#x93;16 out of 16 times&#x94; and accused them of &#x93;putting politics into the court system, creating gridlock, and costing taxpayers money.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 86.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL&#x92;s planned airing of the ads had no apparent relation to any Senate filibuster vote but was keyed to the timing of the senatorial election.  WRTL began broadcasting the ads on July 26, 2004, four days after the Senate recessed for the summer, and although the filibuster controversy raged on through 2005, WRTL did not resume running the ads after the election.  <em>Id.</em>, at 29, 32.

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, any Wisconsin voter who paid attention would have known that Democratic Senator Feingold supported filibusters against Republican presidential judicial nominees, that the propriety of the filibusters was a major issue in the senatorial campaign, and that WRTL along with the Senator&#x92;s Republican challengers opposed his reelection because of his position on filibusters.  Any alert voters who heard or saw WRTL&#x92;s ads would have understood that WRTL was telling them that the Senator&#x92;s position on the filibusters should be grounds to vote against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given these facts, it is beyond all reasonable debate that the ads are constitutionally subject to regulation under <em>McConnell</em>.  There, we noted that BCRA was meant to remedy the problem of &#x93;[s]o-called issue ads&#x94; being used &#x93;to advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 126.  We then gave a paradigmatic example of these electioneering ads subject to regulation, saying that &#x93;[l]ittle difference existed . . . between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The WRTL ads were indistinguishable from the Jane Doe ad; they &#x93;condemned [Senator Feingold&#x92;s] record on a particular issue&#x94; and exhorted the public to contact him and &#x93;tell [him] what you think.&#x94;<a name="ZD-16ref" href="#ZD-16" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  And just as anyone who heard the Jane Doe ad would understand that the point was to defeat Doe, anyone who heard the Feingold ads (let alone anyone who went to the website they named) would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.  If it is now unconstitutional to restrict WRTL&#x92;s Feingold ads, then it follows that &#xA7;203 can no longer be applied constitutionally to <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>Jane Doe paradigm.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding that &#xA7;203 is facially constitutional is overruled.  By what steps does the principal opinion reach this unacknowledged result less than four years after <em>McConnell</em> was decided?</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, it lays down a new test to identify a severely limited class of ads that may constitutionally be regulated as electioneering communications, a test that is flatly contrary to <em>McConnell</em>.  An ad is the equivalent of express advocacy and subject to regulation, the opinion says, only if it is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Since the Feingold ads could, in isolation, be read as at least including calls to communicate views on filibusters to the two Senators, those ads cannot be treated as the functional equivalent of express advocacy to elect or defeat anyone, and therefore may not constitutionally be regulated at all.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the same could have been said of the hypothetical Jane Doe ad.  Its spoken message ended with the instruction to tell Doe what the voter thinks.  The same could also have been said of the actual Yellowtail ad.  Yet in <em>McConnell</em>, we gave the Jane Doe ad as the paradigm of a broadcast message that could be constitutionally regulated as election conduct, and we explicitly described the Yellowtail ad as a &#x93;striking example&#x94; of one that was &#x93;clearly intended to influence the election,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 193, and n. 78.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The principal opinion, in other words, simply inverts what we said in <em>McConnell</em>.  While we left open the possibility of a &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure&#x94; issue ad that might not be open to regulation under &#xA7;203, <em>id.</em>, at 206&#x96;207, and n. 88, we meant that an issue ad without campaign advocacy could escape the restriction.  The implication of the adjectives &#x93;genuine&#x94; and &#x93;pure&#x94; is unmistakable: if an ad is reasonably understood as going beyond a discussion of issues (that is, if it can be understood as electoral advocacy), then by definition it is not &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure.&#x94;  But the principal opinion inexplicably wrings the opposite conclusion from those words: if an ad is susceptible to any &#x93;reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; then it must be a &#x93;pure&#x94; or &#x93;genuine&#x94; issue ad.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  This stands <em>McConnell</em> on its head, and on this reasoning it is pos-<span class="softbreak"/>sible that even some ads with magic words could not be regulated.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Second, the principal opinion seems to defend this inversion of <em>McConnell</em> as a necessary alternative to an unadministrable subjective test for the equivalence of express (and regulable) electioneering advocacy.  The principal opinion acknowledges, of course, that in <em>McConnell</em> we said that &#x93;[t]he justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during [the period shortly before an election] if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;  540 U.

            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> were correct that <em>McConnell</em> made the constitutional application of &#xA7;203 contingent on whether a corporation&#x92;s &#x93;motives were pure,&#x94; or its issue advocacy &#x93;subjective[ly] sincer[e],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted), then I, too, might be inclined to reconsider <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s language.  But <em>McConnell</em> did not do that.  It did not purport to draw constitutional lines based on the subjective motivations of corporations (or their principals) sponsoring political ads, but merely described our test for equivalence to express advocacy as resting on the ads&#x92; &#x93;electioneering purpose,&#x94; which will be objectively apparent from those ads&#x92; content and context (as these cases and the examples cited in <em>McConnell </em>readily show).  We therefore held that &#xA7;203 was not substantially overbroad because &#x93;the vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose,&#x94; and consequently could be regulated consistent with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  540 U. S., at 206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, if the studies to which <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> refers were now to inform our reading of <em>McConnell</em>, they would merely underscore the objective character of the proper way to determine whether &#xA7;203 is constitutional as applied to a given ad.  The authors of those studies did not conduct discovery of the &#x93;actua[l] inten[tions],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14, behind any ads; nor, to my knowledge, were the sponsors of campaign ads summoned before researchers to explain their motivations.  The studies merely confirmed that &#x93;reasonable people are &#x2026; able to discern between ads whose primary purpose is to support a candidate and those intended to provide information about a policy issue.&#x94;  J. Krasno &amp; D. Seltz, Buying Time: Television Advertising in the 1998 Congressional Elections 9 (2000).  To be clear, I am not endorsing the precise methodology of those studies (and <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> is correct that we did not do so in <em>McConnell</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13, n. 4); the point is only that the studies relied on a &#x93;reasonable&#x94; person&#x92;s understanding of the ads&#x92; apparent purpose, and thus were no less objective than <span class="smallcaps">The</span>

        <p class="bodytext">    A similarly mistaken fear of an unadministrable and speech-chilling subjective regime seems to underlie <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice&#x92;</span>s unwillingness to acknowledge the part that consideration of an ad&#x92;s context necessarily plays in any realistic assessment of its meaning.  A reasonable Wisconsinite watching or listening to WRTL&#x92;s ads would likely ask and answer some obvious questions about their circumstances.  Is the group that sponsors these ads the same one publicly campaigning against Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection?  <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> says that this information is &#x93;beside the point,&#x94; because WRTL&#x92;s history of overt electioneering only &#x93;goes to [its] subjective intent.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Did these &#x93;issue&#x94; ads begin appearing on the air during the election season, rather than at the time the filibuster &#x93;issue&#x94; was in fact being debated in the Senate?  This, too, is said to be irrelevant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  And does the website to which WRTL&#x92;s ads direct viewers contain material expressly advocating Senator Feingold&#x92;s defeat?  This enquiry is dismissed as being &#x93;one step removed from the text of the ads themselves.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  But these questions are central to the meaning of the ads, and any reasonable person would take account of circumstances in coming to understand the object of WRTL&#x92;s ad.  And why not?  Each of the contextual facts here can be established by an objective look at a public record; none requires a voter (or a litigant) to engage in discovery of evidence about WRTL&#x92;s operations or internal communications, and none goes to a hidden state of mind.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This refusal to see and hear what any listener to WRTL&#x92;s ads would actually consider produces a rule no different in practice from the one adopted by the District Court, which declined to look beyond the &#x93;four corners&#x94; of the ads themselves.  466 F.

            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> ostensibly stops short of categorically foreclosing consideration of context, see <em>ante</em>, at 20, the application of his test here makes it difficult to see how relevant contextual evidence could ever be taken into account the way it was in <em>McConnell</em>,<a name="ZD-19ref" href="#ZD-19" class="">

        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Third, it may be that the principal opinion rejects <em>McConnell </em>on the erroneous assumption that &#xA7;203 flatly bans independent electioneering communications by a corporation.  <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> argues that corporations must receive &#x93;the benefit of any doubt,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16,<em/>whenever we undertake the task of &#x93;separating &#x2026; political speech protected under the

            <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 203&#x96;204 (quoting <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 162).  Thus, a successful as-applied challenger to &#xA7;203 should necessarily show, at the least, that it could not constitutionally be subjected to the administrative rules that govern a PAC&#x92;s formation and operation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 163.  This would be an uphill fight, after our repeated affirmations that the PAC structure does not impose excessive burdens, <em>ibid.</em> (citing <em>National Right to Work Comm.</em>, 459 U. S., at 201&#x96;202), and WRTL has a particularly weak position on this point: it set up its own PAC long before the 2004 election, used it to campaign openly against Senator Feingold in the past, and could have raised noncorporate donations to it in the 2004 election cycle.  Any argument that establishing and maintaining a PAC is unconstitutionally burdensome for WRTL would thus likely be futile, and certainly should not prevail on WRTL&#x92;s summary judgment motion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, even without the PAC alternative, it would be untrue that &#xA7;203 &#x93;banned&#x94; WRTL from saying anything a genuine issue ad would say, for WRTL could have availed itself of either or both of the following additional options.  It is undisputed that WRTL&#x92;s ads could have been broadcast lawfully in the runup to the election (and bankrolled from WRTL&#x92;s general treasury) if Senator Feingold&#x92;s name had been omitted and the Senator not otherwise singled out.  Since members of today&#x92;s majority apparently view WRTL&#x92;s broadcasts either as &#x93;genuine issue ad[s],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16 (opinion of <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>), or as &#x93;lobby[ing] Wisconsin voters concerning the filibustering of the President&#x92;s judicial nominees,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 2 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.,</span> concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a claim that omitting Senator Feingold&#x92;s name would &#x93;ban&#x94; WRTL&#x92;s message is specious.  Yet one searches my Brothers&#x92; opinions in vain for any persuasive reason why substituting the phrase &#x93;Contact your Senators&#x94; for the phrase &#x93;Contact Senators Feingold and Kohl&#x94; would have denied WRTL a constitutionally sufficient (and clearly lawful) alternative way to send its message.  If WRTL is to be believed when it claims that the issue was the point of the ads, it would have lost nothing by referring simply to the &#x93;Senators.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the suggestion that &#xA7;203 is a ban on political speech is belied by <em>MCFL</em>&#x92;s safe harbor for nonprofit advocacy corporations: under that rule, WRTL would have been free to attack Senator Feingold by name at any time with ads funded from its corporate treasury, if it had not also chosen to serve as a funnel for hundreds of thousands of dollars from other corporations.  Thus, what is called a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech is a limit on the financing of electioneering broadcasts by entities that refuse to take advantage of the PAC structure but insist on acting as conduits from the campaign war chests of business corporations.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, <em>McConnell</em> does not graft a subjective standard onto campaign regulation, the context of campaign advertising cannot sensibly be ignored, and &#xA7;203 is not a ban on speech.  What cannot be gainsaid, in any event, is that in treating these subjects as it does, the operative opinion produces the result of overruling <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding on &#xA7;203, less than four years in the Reports.  Anyone who doubts that need merely ask what the law would have been if, back in 2003, this Court had held &#xA7;203 facially unconstitutional.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    BCRA&#x92;s definition of &#x93;electioneering communication,&#x94; which identifies the communications regulable under &#xA7;203, includes a backup to be used if the primary definition &#x93;is held to be constitutionally insufficient by final judicial decision to support the regulation provided herein.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_A_ii" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(A)(ii)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If this should occur, &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; is to be defined as </p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This backup sounds familiar because it is essentially identical to <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s test for evaluating an as-applied challenge to the original definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94;: regulation is permissible only if the communication is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16.  Thus does the principal opinion institute the very standard that would have prevailed if the Court formally overruled <em>McConnell</em>.  There is neither a theoretical nor a practical basis to claim that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s treatment of &#xA7;203 survives.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">E</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The price of <em>McConnell&#x92;</em>s<em/>demise as authority on &#xA7;203 seems to me to be a high one.  The Court (and, I think, the country) loses when important precedent is overruled without good reason, and there is no justification for departing from our usual rule of <em>stare decisis</em> here.  The same combination of alternatives that was available to corporations affected by <em>McConnell</em> in 2003 is available today: WRTL could have run a newspaper ad, could have paid for the broadcast ads through its PAC, could have established itself as an <em>MCFL</em> organization free of corporate money, and could have said &#x93;call your Senators&#x94; instead of naming Senator Feingold in its ads broadcasted just before the election.  Nothing in the related law surrounding &#xA7;203 has changed in any way, let alone in any way that undermines <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>rationale.  See <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Nor can any serious argument be made that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding has been &#x93;unworkable in practice.&#x94;  <em>Allied-Signal, Inc.</em> v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation</em>,

            </a>  Although WRTL contends that the as-applied remedy has proven to be &#x93;[i]nadequate&#x94; because such challenges cannot be litigated quickly enough to avoid being mooted, Brief for Appellee 65&#x96;66, nothing prevents an advertiser from obtaining a preliminary injunction if it can qualify for one, and WRTL does not point to any evidence that district courts have been unable to rule on any such matters in a timely way.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, it goes without saying that nothing has changed about the facts.  In Justice Frankfurter&#x92;s words, they demonstrate a threat to &#x93;the integrity of our electoral process,&#x94; <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 570, which for a century now Congress has repeatedly found to be imperiled by corporate, and later union, money: witness the Tillman Act, Taft-Hartley, FECA, and BCRA.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  <em>McConnell </em>was our latest decision vindicating clear and reasonable boundaries that Congress has drawn to limit &#x93; &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth,&#x92; &#x94; 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660), and the decision could claim the justification of ongoing fact as well as decisional history in recognizing Congress&#x92;s authority to protect the integrity of elections from the distortion of corporate and union funds.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After today, the ban on contributions by corporations and unions and the limitation on their corrosive spending when they enter the political arena are open to easy circumvention, and the possibilities for regulating corporate and union campaign money are unclear.  The ban on contributions will mean nothing much, now that companies and unions can save candidates the expense of advertising directly, simply by running &#x93;issue ads&#x94; without express advocacy, or by funneling the money through an independent corporation like WRTL.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the understanding of the voters and the Congress that this kind of corporate and union spending seriously jeopardizes the integrity of democratic government will remain.  The facts are too powerful to be ignored, and further efforts at campaign finance reform will come.  It is only the legal landscape that now is altered, and it may be that today&#x92;s departure from precedent will drive further reexamination of the constitutional analysis: of the distinction between contributions and expenditures, or the relation between spending and speech, which have given structure to our thinking since <em>Buckley</em> itself was decided.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    I cannot tell what the future will force upon us, but I respectfully dissent from this judgment today.</p>

.  Ante, at 7 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Bellotti, however, concerned corporate spending in connection with a referendum, and we went out of our way in that case to avoid casting any doubt upon the constitutionality of limiting corporate expenditures during candidate elections.  We said:


&#x93;The overriding concern behind the enactment of [the federal restrictions on corporate contributions and expenditures] was the problem of corruption of elected representatives through the creation of political debts.  The importance of the governmental interest in preventing this occurrence has never been doubted.  The case before us presents no comparable problem, and our consideration of a corporation&#x92;s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.  Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.&#x94;  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26 (citations omitted).


Eight years before Austin, we unanimously reaffirmed that Bellotti &#x93;specifically pointed out that in elections of candidates to public office, unlike in referenda on issues of general public interest, there may well be a threat of real or apparent corruption.&#x94;  Federal Election Comm&#x92;n v.

Then, four years later, in MCFL, we also noted that an expenditure limit offering corporations a PAC alternative is &#x93;distinguishable from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for political speech&#x94; that we addressed in Bellotti.  479 U.

So Austin did not &#x93;stra[y]&#x94; from Bellotti, ante, at 7 (opinion of Scalia, J.); the reasons Bellotti was not controlling in Austin had been clearly foreshadowed in Bellotti itself and confirmed repeatedly in our decisions leading up to Austin.

&#x93;Especially beginning in 1996, issue advocacy during the campaign season dramatically expanded in Wisconsin.
.....


&#x93;The Commission concludes that, in each of these cases, the expenditures were clearly campaign-oriented activities.  They were quite clearly designed to influence the electoral process.  They were focused either on electing or defeating a candidate.  The Commission bases this conclusion on the following points:


&#x93;Although those paying for the activities claimed they were aimed solely at educating voters on the issues, they each mentioned the names of candidates for office.


&#x93;They occurred only when election races were in progress that involved a contest between an incumbent and a challenger.  When the election was over, the activities ended.


&#x93;The activity has occurred after legislative sessions when the issues about which advocacy was occurring were not being deliberated by the legislature.


&#x93;The activity occurred in campaign season, between the candidate&#x92;s filing for candidacy and election time.  Advertisements of this sort have tended to occur at virtually no other time.


&#x93;The activity involved the electronic media, mass mailings, or centrally located telephone banks.
.....


&#x93;The explosive growth of campaign-based advocacy, without even disclosure of its activities and funding sources, poses a grave risk to the integrity of elections. It has created a two-tiered campaign process: one, based in candidates and political parties, which is tightly regulated and controlled; the other, based in interest group activity under the guise of &#x91;issue advocacy&#x92; but actually quite clearly election-focused, which lies beyond accountability.&#x94;  1 Governor&#x92;s Blue-Ribbon Commission on Campaign Finance Reform, State of Wisconsin: Report of the Commission, available at http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-17" href="#ZD-17ref">17</a> The Chief Justice says that Buckley v. Valeo, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
 (per curiam), &#x93;already rejected&#x94; any test that calls for an assessment of the intent and effect of corporate electioneering.  Ante, at 13.  The &#x93;reject[ion]&#x94; to which The Chief Justice presumably refers is Buckley&#x92;s quotation of Thomas v. Collins, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/516" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 516</a> (1945)
, where we found impermissibly vague a statute that permitted a union leader to &#x93; &#x91;laud unionism&#x92; &#x94; but forbade him to &#x93;imply an invitation&#x94; to join a union.  Id., at 534.  The problem with this predicament, we reasoned, was the lack of a clearly permissible opportunity for expression:  Whether words &#x93;designed to fall short of invitation would miss that mark is a question both of intent and of effect,&#x94; and no speaker &#x93;safely could assume that anything he might say &#x2026; would not be understood by some as an invitation.&#x94;  Id., at 535.  We then specified that the speaker in Thomas was left with an impermissibly limited universe of &#x93;three choices: (1) to stand on his right and speak freely; (2) to quit, refusing entirely to speak; (3) to trim, and even thus to risk the penalty.&#x94;  Id., at 536.


The Chief Justice implies that considering the intent and effect of corporate advertising during as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203 would put corporations in precisely the same bind; thus, he wonders how McConnell could use the language of intent and effect without &#x93;even address[ing] what Buckley&#x94; (and by extension, Thomas) &#x93;had to say on the subject.&#x94;  Ante, at 14.  But one need not look far in our McConnell opinion to understand why we thought that corporations have more than the constrained set of options available to the union leader in Thomas.  Just a few sentences after holding that ads with electioneering intent and effect are regulable, we gave this explanation: &#x93;in the future corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads [shortly before an election] by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.  In other words, corporations can find refuge in constitutionally sufficient and clearly delineated safe harbors by modifying the content of their ads (by omitting a candidate&#x92;s name) or by altering the sources of their ads&#x92; financing (from general treasuries to PACs).  The Chief Justice thus wrongly jettisons our conclusions about the constitutionality of regulating ads with electioneering purpose; we meant what we said in McConnell, and we did not overlook 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence when we said it.  Whereas The Chief Justice says that BCRA &#x93;should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights,&#x94; ante, at 14, we already held in McConnell that the campaign finance law accomplishes precisely that.
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-18" href="#ZD-18ref">18</a> The Chief Justice speculates that McConnell derived its test for functional equivalence from &#x93;[t]wo key studies,&#x94; ante, at 12, but not a shred of language in McConnell supports that theory.  In stating the legal standard, McConnell made no mention of any study.  What is the authority, then, for asserting that the studies were pivotal to the standard we announced in McConnell?  See ante, at 12.  Other than WRTL&#x92;s brief, The Chief Justice cites only Judge Henderson&#x92;s separate district court opinion in McConnell.  Ante, at 12.  But The Chief Justice quotes one part of Judge Henderson&#x92;s analysis and neglects to mention that she in turn was quoting the lead author of one of the studies in question: &#x93;According to the Brennan Center, the Buying Time reports were &#x91;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of&#x92; BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions &#x91;in support of their constitutional validity.&#x92; &#x94;  McConnell, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 307&#x96;308 (opinion of Henderson, J.) (italics in original) (quoting deposition of Craig P. Holman, principal co-author of Buying Time 2000: Television Advertising in the 2000 Federal Elections (Brennan Center 2001)).

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-19" href="#ZD-19ref">19</a> Like the District Court, the only bit of context The Chief Justice would allow the reasonable listener is the congressional agenda: whether the &#x93; &#x91;issue&#x92; &#x94; addressed in an ad currently is, or soon will be, &#x93; &#x91;the subject of legislative scrutiny.&#x92; &#x94;  Ante, at 20 (quoting 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 207).  For example, The Chief Justice says, there would have been &#x93;no reason&#x94; to think that WRTL&#x92;s ad constituted anything but a pure issue ad if it addressed a bill pending during Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection campaign, such as the Universal National Service Act.  Ante, at 17.  It is revealing, of course, that The Chief Justice does not invoke the filibuster issue, the subject of WRTL&#x92;s ads, as the legislative matter with particular salience during the 2004 election.  But why the reasonable listener can look to Congress but not the calendar on the wall or a WRTL website is difficult to fathom.
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-20" href="#ZD-20ref">20</a>Justice Scalia also adopts the same misconception that &#xA7;203 is a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech.  See ante, at 18 (&#x93;Section 203&#x92;s line is bright, but it bans vast amounts of political advocacy indistinguishable from hitherto protected speech&#x94;).
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-21" href="#ZD-21ref">21</a> These as-applied challenges provide no reason to second-guess our conclusion in McConnell that the rule for differentiating between electioneering ads and genuine issue ads is administrable.  WRTL&#x92;s ads clearly have an electioneering purpose and, as explained above, fall comfortably within the heartland of electioneering communications that &#xA7;203 may validly regulate.  Thus, although Justice Scalia claims that &#x93;[t]oday&#x92;s cases make it apparent&#x94; that McConnell must be overruled, ante, at 18, there is nothing about today&#x92;s cases that suggests that McConnell is unworkable.  We therefore have no occasion to reconsider McConnell from first principles.

        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensable ingredient of a political candidacy is money for advertising.  In the 2004 campaign, more than half of the combined expenditures by the two principal presidential candidates (excluding fundraising) went for media time and space.  See The Costliest Campaign, Washington Post, Dec. 30, 2004, p. A7.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>2</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And in the 2005&#x96;2006 election cycle, the expenditure of more than $2 billion on television shattered the previous record, even without a presidential contest.  See Inside Media, MediaWeek, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 18.  The portent is for still greater spending.  By the end of March 2007, almost a year before the first primary and more than 18 months before the general election, presidential candidates had already raised over $150 million.  See Balz, Fundraising Totals Challenge Early Campaign Assumptions, Washington Post, Apr. 17, 2007, p. A1 (citing figures and noting that &#x93;[t]he campaign is living up to its reputation as the most expensive in U. S. history&#x94;).  To reach this total, the leading fundraisers collected over $250,000 per day in the first quarter of 2007, Mullins, Clinton Leads the Money Race, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2007, p. A8, and the eventual nominees are expected to raise $500 million apiece (about $680,000 per day over a 2-year election cycle), Kirkpatrick and Pilhofer, McCain Lags in Income But Excels in Spending, Report Shows, N. Y. Times, Apr. 15, 2007, p. 20.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensability of these huge sums has two significant consequences for American Government that are particularly on point here.  The enormous demands, first, assign power to deep pockets.  See Balz, <em>supra</em>, at A6 (&#x93;For all the interest in Internet fundraising, big donors still ruled in the first quarter, with roughly 80 percent of donations coming in amounts of $1,000 or more&#x94;).  Candidates occasionally boast about the number of contributors they have, but the headlines speaking in dollars reflect political reality.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Mullins, <em>supra</em>, at A8 (headlined &#x93;Clinton Leads the Money Race&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Some major contributors get satisfaction from pitching in for their candidates, but political preference fails to account for the frequency of giving &#x93;substantial sums to <em>both</em> major national parties,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 148, a practice driven &#x93;by stark political pragmatism, not by ideological support for either party or their candidates,&#x94; Brief for Committee for Economic Development et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> in <em>McConnell</em>, O. T. 2003, No. 02&#x96;1674, p. 3 (hereinafter CED Brief).  What the high-dollar pragmatists of either variety get is special access to the officials they help elect, and with it a disproportionate influence on those in power.  See <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em/>at 130&#x96;131.  As the erstwhile officer of a large American corporation put it, &#x93; &#x91;[b]usiness leaders believe&#x97;based on experience and with good reason&#x97;that &#x2026; access gives them an opportunity to shape and affect governmental decisions and that their ability to do so derives from the fact that they have given large sums of money to the parties.&#x92; &#x94;  CED Brief 9.  At a critical level, contributions that underwrite elections are leverage for enormous political influence.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Voters know this.  Hence, the second important consequence of the demand for big money to finance publicity: pervasive public cynicism.  A 2002 poll found that 71 percent of Americans think Members of Congress cast votes based on the views of their big contributors, even when those views differ from the Member&#x92;s own beliefs about what is best for the country.  Mellman &amp; Wirthlin 267; see also <em>id.</em>, at 266 (&#x93;In public opinion research it is uncommon to have 70 percent or more of the public see an issue the same way.  When they do, it indicates an unusually strong agreement on that issue&#x94;).  The same percentage believes that the will of contributors tempts Members to vote against the majority view of their constituents.  <em>Id.</em>, at 267.  Almost half of Americans believe that Members often decide how to vote based on what big contributors to their party want, while only a quarter think Members often base their votes on perceptions of what is best for the country or their constituents.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Devoting concentrations of money in self-interested hands to the support of political campaigning therefore threatens the capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents and the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves.  These are the elements summed up in the notion of political integrity, giving it a value second to none in a free society.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the threat to this value flowing from concentrations of money in politics has reached an unprecedented enormity, it has been gathering force for generations.  Before the turn of the last century, as now, it was obvious that the purchase of influence and the cynicism of voters threaten the integrity and stability of democratic government, each derived from the responsiveness of its law to the interests of citizens and their confidence in that focus.  The danger has traditionally seemed at its apex when no reasonable limits constrain the campaign activities of organizations whose &#x93;unique legal and economic characteristics&#x94; are tailored to &#x93;facilitat[e] the amassing of large treasuries,&#x94; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    At the same time, Congress had another worry that foreshadows our case today.  It was concerned that the statutory prohibition on corporate &#x93;contribution[s]&#x94; was being so narrowly construed as to open a &#x93;loophole whereby corporations, national banks, and labor organizations are enabled to avoid the obviously intended restrictive policy of the statute by garbing their financial assistance in the form of an &#x91;expenditure&#x92; rather than a contribution.&#x94;  S. Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38&#x96;39 (1947); see also H. Rep.

Of what avail would a law be to prohibit the contributing direct to a candidate and yet permit the expenditure of large sums in his behalf?&#x94;).

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/441b.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;441b</a>, and drew two conclusions implicated in the present case.  First, we construed the &#x93;in connection with&#x94; phrase in much the same way we had interpreted comparable FECA language challenged in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    We thus held that the prohibition applied &#x93;only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 44.  &#x93;[E]xpress terms,&#x94; in turn, meant what had already become known as &#x93;magic words,&#x94; such as &#x93; &#x91;vote for,&#x92; &#x91;elect,&#x92; &#x91;support,&#x92; &#x91;cast your ballot for,&#x92; &#x91;Smith for Congress,&#x92; &#x91;vote against,&#x92; &#x91;defeat,&#x92; &#x91;reject.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>,<em/>n. 52.  The consequence of this construction was obvious: it pulled the teeth out of the statute, as we had understood when we announced it in its earlier application in Buckley:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness &#x2026; undermines the limitation&#x92;s effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or officeholder.  It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate&#x92;s campaign.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 45.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nor was the statute, even as thus narrowed, enforceable against the particular advocacy corporation challenging the limit in <em>MCFL</em>.

We held that this &#x93;legitima[te]&#x94; concern could not reasonably extend to electioneering expenditures by the corporation at issue in <em>MCFL</em>, which neither &#x93;engage[d] in business activities&#x94; nor accepted donations from business corporations and unions (and thus could not serve as a &#x93;condui[t]&#x94; for political spending by those entities).  <em>Id.</em>, at 263&#x96;264.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    An issue ad is an advertisement on a political subject urging the reader or listener to let a politician know what he thinks, but containing no magic words telling the recipient to vote for or against anyone.

Experience showed, however, just what we foresaw in <em>Buckley</em>, that the line between &#x93;issue&#x94; broadcasts and outright electioneering was a patent fiction, as in the example of a television &#x93;issue ad&#x94; that ran during a Montana congressional race between Republican Rick Hill and Democrat Bill Yellowtail in 1996:</p>

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  We rejected any suggestion &#x93;that <em>Buckley</em> drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy [with magic words] and so-called issue advocacy [without them], and that speakers possess an inviolable 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to engage in the latter category of speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 190.  To the contrary, we held that &#x93;our decisions in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em> were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 192&#x96;193.  &#x93;[T]he presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech,&#x94; which is prohibitable, &#x93;from a true issue ad,&#x94; we said, since ads that &#x93;esche[w] the use of magic words &#x2026; are no less clearly intended to influence the election.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 193.  We thus found &#x93;[l]ittle difference &#x2026; between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We understood that Congress had a compelling interest in limiting this sort of electioneering by corporations and unions, for &#xA7;203 exemplified a tradition of &#x93;repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U.

Nor did we see any plausible claim of substantial overbreadth from incidentally prohibiting ads genuinely focused on issues rather than elections, given the limitation of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; by time, geographical coverage, and clear reference to candidate.  &#x93;Far from establishing that BCRA&#x92;s application to pure issue ads is substantial, either in an absolute sense or relative to its application to election-related advertising, the record strongly supports the contrary conclusion.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 207.  Finally, we underscored the reasonableness of the &#xA7;203 line by emphasizing that it defined a category of limited, but not prohibited, corporate and union speech: &#x93;Because corporations can still fund electioneering communications with PAC money, it is &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression rather than a regulation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 204 (quoting <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em> v. <em>Beaumont</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, Congress in 1907 prohibited corporate contributions to candidates and in 1943 applied the same ban to unions.  In 1947, Congress extended the complete ban from contributions to expenditures &#x93;in connection with&#x94; an election, a phrase so vague that in 1986 we held it must be confined to instances of express advocacy using magic words.  Congress determined, in 2002, that corporate and union expenditures for fake issue ads devoid of magic words should be regulated using a narrow definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; to reach only broadcast ads that were the practical equivalents of express advocacy.  In 2003, this Court found the provision free from vagueness and justified by the concern that drove its enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This century-long tradition of legislation and judicial precedent rests on facing undeniable facts and testifies to an equally undeniable value.  Campaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries, with no redolence of &#x93;grassroots&#x94; about them.  Neither Congress&#x92;s decisions nor our own have understood the corrupting influence of money in politics as being limited to outright bribery or discrete <em>quid pro quo; </em>campaign finance reform has instead consistently focused on the more pervasive distortion of electoral institutions by concentrated wealth, on the special access and guaranteed favor that sap the representative integrity of American government and defy public confidence in its institutions.  From early in the 20th century through the decision in <em>McConnell</em>, we have acknowledged that the value of democratic integrity justifies a realistic response when corporations and labor organizations commit the concentrated moneys in their treasuries to electioneering.</p>

            </a>  In 2004, WRTL accepted over $315,000 in corporate donations, App. 40, and of its six general fund contributions of $50,000 or more between 2002 and 2005, three, including the largest (for $140,000), came from corporate donors, <em>id.</em>, at 118&#x96;121.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL also runs a PAC, funded by individual donations, which has been active over the years in making independent campaign expenditures, as in the previous two elections involving Senator Feingold.  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  During the 1998 campaign, for example, WRTL&#x92;s PAC spent $60,000 to oppose him.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In 2004, however, despite a sharp nationwide increase in PAC receipts, WRTL focused its fundraising on its corporate treasury, not the PAC, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;43, and took in only $17,000 in PAC contributions, as against over $150,000 during 2000, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;42.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Throughout the 2004 senatorial campaign, WRTL made no secret of its views about who should win the election and explicitly tied its position to the filibuster issue.  Its PAC issued at least two press releases saying that its &#x93;Top Election Priorities&#x94; were to &#x93;Re-elect George W. Bush&#x94; and &#x93;Send Feingold Packing!&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 78&#x96;80, 82&#x96;84.  In one of these, the Chair of WRTL&#x92;s PAC was quoted as saying, &#x93; &#x91;We do not want Russ Feingold to continue to have the ability to thwart President Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 82&#x96;83.  The Spring 2004 issue of the WRTL PAC&#x92;s quarterly magazine ran an article headlined &#x93;Radically Pro-Abortion Feingold Must Go!&#x94;, which reported that &#x93;Feingold has been active in his opposition to Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees&#x94; and said that &#x93;the defeat of Feingold must be uppermost in the minds of Wisconsin&#x92;s pro-life community in the 2004 elections.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 101&#x96;103.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    It was under these circumstances that WRTL ran the three television and radio ads in question.  The bills for them were not paid by WRTL&#x92;s PAC, but out of the general treasury with its substantial proportion of corporate contributions; in fact, corporations earmarked more than $50,000 specifically to pay for the ads, <em>id.</em>, at 41.  Each one criticized an unnamed &#x93;group of Senators&#x94; for &#x93;using the filibuster delay tactic to block federal judicial nominees from a simple &#x91;yes&#x92; or &#x91;no&#x92; vote,&#x94; and described the Senators&#x92; actions as &#x93;politics at work, causing gridlock and backing up some of our courts to a state of emergency.&#x94;<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>  They exhorted viewers and listeners to &#x93;[c]ontact Senators Feingold and Kohl and tell them to oppose the filibuster,&#x94; but instead of providing a phone number or e-mail address, they told the audience to go to BeFair.org, a website set up by WRTL.  A visit to this website would erase any doubt a listener or viewer might have as to whether Senators Feingold and Kohl were part of the &#x93;group&#x94; condemned in the ads: it displayed a document that criticized the two Senators for voting to filibuster &#x93;16 out of 16 times&#x94; and accused them of &#x93;putting politics into the court system, creating gridlock, and costing taxpayers money.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 86.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL&#x92;s planned airing of the ads had no apparent relation to any Senate filibuster vote but was keyed to the timing of the senatorial election.  WRTL began broadcasting the ads on July 26, 2004, four days after the Senate recessed for the summer, and although the filibuster controversy raged on through 2005, WRTL did not resume running the ads after the election.  <em>Id.</em>, at 29, 32.  During the campaign period that the ads did cover, Senator Feingold&#x92;s support of the filibusters was a prominent issue.  His position was well known,<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, any Wisconsin voter who paid attention would have known that Democratic Senator Feingold supported filibusters against Republican presidential judicial nominees, that the propriety of the filibusters was a major issue in the senatorial campaign, and that WRTL along with the Senator&#x92;s Republican challengers opposed his reelection because of his position on filibusters.  Any alert voters who heard or saw WRTL&#x92;s ads would have understood that WRTL was telling them that the Senator&#x92;s position on the filibusters should be grounds to vote against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given these facts, it is beyond all reasonable debate that the ads are constitutionally subject to regulation under <em>McConnell</em>.  There, we noted that BCRA was meant to remedy the problem of &#x93;[s]o-called issue ads&#x94; being used &#x93;to advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 126.  We then gave a paradigmatic example of these electioneering ads subject to regulation, saying that &#x93;[l]ittle difference existed . . . between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The WRTL ads were indistinguishable from the Jane Doe ad; they &#x93;condemned [Senator Feingold&#x92;s] record on a particular issue&#x94; and exhorted the public to contact him and &#x93;tell [him] what you think.&#x94;<a name="ZD-16ref" href="#ZD-16" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>16</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And just as anyone who heard the Jane Doe ad would understand that the point was to defeat Doe, anyone who heard the Feingold ads (let alone anyone who went to the website they named) would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.  If it is now unconstitutional to restrict WRTL&#x92;s Feingold ads, then it follows that &#xA7;203 can no longer be applied constitutionally to <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>Jane Doe paradigm.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding that &#xA7;203 is facially constitutional is overruled.  By what steps does the principal opinion reach this unacknowledged result less than four years after <em>McConnell</em> was decided?</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, it lays down a new test to identify a severely limited class of ads that may constitutionally be regulated as electioneering communications, a test that is flatly contrary to <em>McConnell</em>.  An ad is the equivalent of express advocacy and subject to regulation, the opinion says, only if it is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Since the Feingold ads could, in isolation, be read as at least including calls to communicate views on filibusters to the two Senators, those ads cannot be treated as the functional equivalent of express advocacy to elect or defeat anyone, and therefore may not constitutionally be regulated at all.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the same could have been said of the hypothetical Jane Doe ad.  Its spoken message ended with the instruction to tell Doe what the voter thinks.  The same could also have been said of the actual Yellowtail ad.  Yet in <em>McConnell</em>, we gave the Jane Doe ad as the paradigm of a broadcast message that could be constitutionally regulated as election conduct, and we explicitly described the Yellowtail ad as a &#x93;striking example&#x94; of one that was &#x93;clearly intended to influence the election,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 193, and n. 78.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The principal opinion, in other words, simply inverts what we said in <em>McConnell</em>.  While we left open the possibility of a &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure&#x94; issue ad that might not be open to regulation under &#xA7;203, <em>id.</em>, at 206&#x96;207, and n. 88, we meant that an issue ad without campaign advocacy could escape the restriction.  The implication of the adjectives &#x93;genuine&#x94; and &#x93;pure&#x94; is unmistakable: if an ad is reasonably understood as going beyond a discussion of issues (that is, if it can be understood as electoral advocacy), then by definition it is not &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure.&#x94;  But the principal opinion inexplicably wrings the opposite conclusion from those words: if an ad is susceptible to any &#x93;reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; then it must be a &#x93;pure&#x94; or &#x93;genuine&#x94; issue ad.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  This stands <em>McConnell</em> on its head, and on this reasoning it is pos-<span class="softbreak"/>sible that even some ads with magic words could not be regulated.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Second, the principal opinion seems to defend this inversion of <em>McConnell</em> as a necessary alternative to an unadministrable subjective test for the equivalence of express (and regulable) electioneering advocacy.  The principal opinion acknowledges, of course, that in <em>McConnell</em> we said that &#x93;[t]he justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during [the period shortly before an election] if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;  540 U.

But <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> says that statement in <em>McConnell</em> cannot be accepted at face value because we could not, consistent with precedent, have focused our

            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> were correct that <em>McConnell</em> made the constitutional application of &#xA7;203 contingent on whether a corporation&#x92;s &#x93;motives were pure,&#x94; or its issue advocacy &#x93;subjective[ly] sincer[e],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted), then I, too, might be inclined to reconsider <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s language.  But <em>McConnell</em> did not do that.  It did not purport to draw constitutional lines based on the subjective motivations of corporations (or their principals) sponsoring political ads, but merely described our test for equivalence to express advocacy as resting on the ads&#x92; &#x93;electioneering purpose,&#x94; which will be objectively apparent from those ads&#x92; content and context (as these cases and the examples cited in <em>McConnell </em>readily show).  We therefore held that &#xA7;203 was not substantially overbroad because &#x93;the vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose,&#x94; and consequently could be regulated consistent with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  540 U. S., at 206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, if the studies to which <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> refers were now to inform our reading of <em>McConnell</em>, they would merely underscore the objective character of the proper way to determine whether &#xA7;203 is constitutional as applied to a given ad.  The authors of those studies did not conduct discovery of the &#x93;actua[l] inten[tions],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14, behind any ads; nor, to my knowledge, were the sponsors of campaign ads summoned before researchers to explain their motivations.  The studies merely confirmed that &#x93;reasonable people are &#x2026; able to discern between ads whose primary purpose is to support a candidate and those intended to provide information about a policy issue.&#x94;  J.

To be clear, I am not endorsing the precise methodology of those studies (and <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> is correct that we did not do so in <em>McConnell</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13, n. 4); the point is only that the studies relied on a &#x93;reasonable&#x94; person&#x92;s understanding of the ads&#x92; apparent purpose, and thus were no less objective than <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s own approach.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A similarly mistaken fear of an unadministrable and speech-chilling subjective regime seems to underlie <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice&#x92;</span>s unwillingness to acknowledge the part that consideration of an ad&#x92;s context necessarily plays in any realistic assessment of its meaning.  A reasonable Wisconsinite watching or listening to WRTL&#x92;s ads would likely ask and answer some obvious questions about their circumstances.  Is the group that sponsors these ads the same one publicly campaigning against Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection?  <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> says that this information is &#x93;beside the point,&#x94; because WRTL&#x92;s history of overt electioneering only &#x93;goes to [its] subjective intent.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Did these &#x93;issue&#x94; ads begin appearing on the air during the election season, rather than at the time the filibuster &#x93;issue&#x94; was in fact being debated in the Senate?  This, too, is said to be irrelevant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  And does the website to which WRTL&#x92;s ads direct viewers contain material expressly advocating Senator Feingold&#x92;s defeat?  This enquiry is dismissed as being &#x93;one step removed from the text of the ads themselves.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  But these questions are central to the meaning of the ads, and any reasonable person would take account of circumstances in coming to understand the object of WRTL&#x92;s ad.  And why not?  Each of the contextual facts here can be established by an objective look at a public record; none requires a voter (or a litigant) to engage in discovery of evidence about WRTL&#x92;s operations or internal communications, and none goes to a hidden state of mind.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This refusal to see and hear what any listener to WRTL&#x92;s ads would actually consider produces a rule no different in practice from the one adopted by the District Court, which declined to look beyond the &#x93;four corners&#x94; of the ads themselves.  466 F.

            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> ostensibly stops short of categorically foreclosing consideration of context, see <em>ante</em>, at 20, the application of his test here makes it difficult to see how relevant contextual evidence could ever be taken into account the way it was in <em>McConnell</em>,<a name="ZD-19ref" href="#ZD-19" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Third, it may be that the principal opinion rejects <em>McConnell </em>on the erroneous assumption that &#xA7;203 flatly bans independent electioneering communications by a corporation.  <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> argues that corporations must receive &#x93;the benefit of any doubt,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16,<em/>whenever we undertake the task of &#x93;separating &#x2026; political speech protected under the

            <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 203&#x96;204 (quoting <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 162).  Thus, a successful as-applied challenger to &#xA7;203 should necessarily show, at the least, that it could not constitutionally be subjected to the administrative rules that govern a PAC&#x92;s formation and operation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 163.  This would be an uphill fight, after our repeated affirmations that the PAC structure does not impose excessive burdens, <em>ibid.</em> (citing <em>National Right to Work Comm.</em>, 459 U. S., at 201&#x96;202), and WRTL has a particularly weak position on this point: it set up its own PAC long before the 2004 election, used it to campaign openly against Senator Feingold in the past, and could have raised noncorporate donations to it in the 2004 election cycle.  Any argument that establishing and maintaining a PAC is unconstitutionally burdensome for WRTL would thus likely be futile, and certainly should not prevail on WRTL&#x92;s summary judgment motion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, even without the PAC alternative, it would be untrue that &#xA7;203 &#x93;banned&#x94; WRTL from saying anything a genuine issue ad would say, for WRTL could have availed itself of either or both of the following additional options.  It is undisputed that WRTL&#x92;s ads could have been broadcast lawfully in the runup to the election (and bankrolled from WRTL&#x92;s general treasury) if Senator Feingold&#x92;s name had been omitted and the Senator not otherwise singled out.  Since members of today&#x92;s majority apparently view WRTL&#x92;s broadcasts either as &#x93;genuine issue ad[s],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16 (opinion of <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>), or as &#x93;lobby[ing] Wisconsin voters concerning the filibustering of the President&#x92;s judicial nominees,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 2 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.,</span> concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a claim that omitting Senator Feingold&#x92;s name would &#x93;ban&#x94; WRTL&#x92;s message is specious.  Yet one searches my Brothers&#x92; opinions in vain for any persuasive reason why substituting the phrase &#x93;Contact your Senators&#x94; for the phrase &#x93;Contact Senators Feingold and Kohl&#x94; would have denied WRTL a constitutionally sufficient (and clearly lawful) alternative way to send its message.  If WRTL is to be believed when it claims that the issue was the point of the ads, it would have lost nothing by referring simply to the &#x93;Senators.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the suggestion that &#xA7;203 is a ban on political speech is belied by <em>MCFL</em>&#x92;s safe harbor for nonprofit advocacy corporations: under that rule, WRTL would have been free to attack Senator Feingold by name at any time with ads funded from its corporate treasury, if it had not also chosen to serve as a funnel for hundreds of thousands of dollars from other corporations.  Thus, what is called a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech is a limit on the financing of electioneering broadcasts by entities that refuse to take advantage of the PAC structure but insist on acting as conduits from the campaign war chests of business corporations.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, <em>McConnell</em> does not graft a subjective standard onto campaign regulation, the context of campaign advertising cannot sensibly be ignored, and &#xA7;203 is not a ban on speech.  What cannot be gainsaid, in any event, is that in treating these subjects as it does, the operative opinion produces the result of overruling <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding on &#xA7;203, less than four years in the Reports.  Anyone who doubts that need merely ask what the law would have been if, back in 2003, this Court had held &#xA7;203 facially unconstitutional.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    BCRA&#x92;s definition of &#x93;electioneering communication,&#x94; which identifies the communications regulable under &#xA7;203, includes a backup to be used if the primary definition &#x93;is held to be constitutionally insufficient by final judicial decision to support the regulation provided herein.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_A_ii" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(A)(ii)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If this should occur, &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; is to be defined as </p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This backup sounds familiar because it is essentially identical to <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s test for evaluating an as-applied challenge to the original definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94;: regulation is permissible only if the communication is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16.  Thus does the principal opinion institute the very standard that would have prevailed if the Court formally overruled <em>McConnell</em>.  There is neither a theoretical nor a practical basis to claim that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s treatment of &#xA7;203 survives.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">E</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The price of <em>McConnell&#x92;</em>s<em/>demise as authority on &#xA7;203 seems to me to be a high one.  The Court (and, I think, the country) loses when important precedent is overruled without good reason, and there is no justification for departing from our usual rule of <em>stare decisis</em> here.  The same combination of alternatives that was available to corporations affected by <em>McConnell</em> in 2003 is available today: WRTL could have run a newspaper ad, could have paid for the broadcast ads through its PAC, could have established itself as an <em>MCFL</em> organization free of corporate money, and could have said &#x93;call your Senators&#x94; instead of naming Senator Feingold in its ads broadcasted just before the election.  Nothing in the related law surrounding &#xA7;203 has changed in any way, let alone in any way that undermines <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>rationale.  See <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>,

.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nor can any serious argument be made that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding has been &#x93;unworkable in practice.&#x94;  <em>Allied-Signal, Inc.</em> v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation</em>,

            </a>  Although WRTL contends that the as-applied remedy has proven to be &#x93;[i]nadequate&#x94; because such challenges cannot be litigated quickly enough to avoid being mooted, Brief for Appellee 65&#x96;66, nothing prevents an advertiser from obtaining a preliminary injunction if it can qualify for one, and WRTL does not point to any evidence that district courts have been unable to rule on any such matters in a timely way.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, it goes without saying that nothing has changed about the facts.  In Justice Frankfurter&#x92;s words, they demonstrate a threat to &#x93;the integrity of our electoral process,&#x94; <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 570, which for a century now Congress has repeatedly found to be imperiled by corporate, and later union, money: witness the Tillman Act, Taft-Hartley, FECA, and BCRA.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  <em>McConnell </em>was our latest decision vindicating clear and reasonable boundaries that Congress has drawn to limit &#x93; &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth,&#x92; &#x94; 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660), and the decision could claim the justification of ongoing fact as well as decisional history in recognizing Congress&#x92;s authority to protect the integrity of elections from the distortion of corporate and union funds.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After today, the ban on contributions by corporations and unions and the limitation on their corrosive spending when they enter the political arena are open to easy circumvention, and the possibilities for regulating corporate and union campaign money are unclear.  The ban on contributions will mean nothing much, now that companies and unions can save candidates the expense of advertising directly, simply by running &#x93;issue ads&#x94; without express advocacy, or by funneling the money through an independent corporation like WRTL.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the understanding of the voters and the Congress that this kind of corporate and union spending seriously jeopardizes the integrity of democratic government will remain.  The facts are too powerful to be ignored, and further efforts at campaign finance reform will come.  It is only the legal landscape that now is altered, and it may be that today&#x92;s departure from precedent will drive further reexamination of the constitutional analysis: of the distinction between contributions and expenditures, or the relation between spending and speech, which have given structure to our thinking since <em>Buckley</em> itself was decided.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    I cannot tell what the future will force upon us, but I respectfully dissent from this judgment today.</p>

Justice Scalia asserts that Austin &#x93;strayed far from&#x94; the principles we announced in First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,

.  Ante, at 7 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Bellotti, however, concerned corporate spending in connection with a referendum, and we went out of our way in that case to avoid casting any doubt upon the constitutionality of limiting corporate expenditures during candidate elections.  We said:


&#x93;The overriding concern behind the enactment of [the federal restrictions on corporate contributions and expenditures] was the problem of corruption of elected representatives through the creation of political debts.  The importance of the governmental interest in preventing this occurrence has never been doubted.  The case before us presents no comparable problem, and our consideration of a corporation&#x92;s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.  Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.&#x94;  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26 (citations omitted).


Eight years before Austin, we unanimously reaffirmed that Bellotti &#x93;specifically pointed out that in elections of candidates to public office, unlike in referenda on issues of general public interest, there may well be a threat of real or apparent corruption.&#x94;  Federal Election Comm&#x92;n v.

Then, four years later, in MCFL, we also noted that an expenditure limit offering corporations a PAC alternative is &#x93;distinguishable from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for political speech&#x94; that we addressed in Bellotti.  479 U. S., at 259, n. 12.  So Austin did not &#x93;stra[y]&#x94; from Bellotti, ante, at 7 (opinion of Scalia, J.); the reasons Bellotti was not controlling in Austin had been clearly foreshadowed in Bellotti itself and confirmed repeatedly in our decisions leading up to Austin.

&#x93;Especially beginning in 1996, issue advocacy during the campaign season dramatically expanded in Wisconsin.
.....


&#x93;The Commission concludes that, in each of these cases, the expenditures were clearly campaign-oriented activities.  They were quite clearly designed to influence the electoral process.  They were focused either on electing or defeating a candidate.  The Commission bases this conclusion on the following points:


&#x93;Although those paying for the activities claimed they were aimed solely at educating voters on the issues, they each mentioned the names of candidates for office.


&#x93;They occurred only when election races were in progress that involved a contest between an incumbent and a challenger.  When the election was over, the activities ended.


&#x93;The activity has occurred after legislative sessions when the issues about which advocacy was occurring were not being deliberated by the legislature.


&#x93;The activity occurred in campaign season, between the candidate&#x92;s filing for candidacy and election time.  Advertisements of this sort have tended to occur at virtually no other time.


&#x93;The activity involved the electronic media, mass mailings, or centrally located telephone banks.
.....


&#x93;The explosive growth of campaign-based advocacy, without even disclosure of its activities and funding sources, poses a grave risk to the integrity of elections. It has created a two-tiered campaign process: one, based in candidates and political parties, which is tightly regulated and controlled; the other, based in interest group activity under the guise of &#x91;issue advocacy&#x92; but actually quite clearly election-focused, which lies beyond accountability.&#x94;  1 Governor&#x92;s Blue-Ribbon Commission on Campaign Finance Reform, State of Wisconsin: Report of the Commission, available at http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
 (per curiam), &#x93;already rejected&#x94; any test that calls for an assessment of the intent and effect of corporate electioneering.  Ante, at 13.  The &#x93;reject[ion]&#x94; to which The Chief Justice presumably refers is Buckley&#x92;s quotation of Thomas v. Collins, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/516" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 516</a> (1945)
, where we found impermissibly vague a statute that permitted a union leader to &#x93; &#x91;laud unionism&#x92; &#x94; but forbade him to &#x93;imply an invitation&#x94; to join a union.  Id., at 534.  The problem with this predicament, we reasoned, was the lack of a clearly permissible opportunity for expression:  Whether words &#x93;designed to fall short of invitation would miss that mark is a question both of intent and of effect,&#x94; and no speaker &#x93;safely could assume that anything he might say &#x2026; would not be understood by some as an invitation.&#x94;  Id., at 535.  We then specified that the speaker in Thomas was left with an impermissibly limited universe of &#x93;three choices: (1) to stand on his right and speak freely; (2) to quit, refusing entirely to speak; (3) to trim, and even thus to risk the penalty.&#x94;  Id., at 536.


The Chief Justice implies that considering the intent and effect of corporate advertising during as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203 would put corporations in precisely the same bind; thus, he wonders how McConnell could use the language of intent and effect without &#x93;even address[ing] what Buckley&#x94; (and by extension, Thomas) &#x93;had to say on the subject.&#x94;  Ante, at 14.  But one need not look far in our McConnell opinion to understand why we thought that corporations have more than the constrained set of options available to the union leader in Thomas.  Just a few sentences after holding that ads with electioneering intent and effect are regulable, we gave this explanation: &#x93;in the future corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads [shortly before an election] by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.  In other words, corporations can find refuge in constitutionally sufficient and clearly delineated safe harbors by modifying the content of their ads (by omitting a candidate&#x92;s name) or by altering the sources of their ads&#x92; financing (from general treasuries to PACs).  The Chief Justice thus wrongly jettisons our conclusions about the constitutionality of regulating ads with electioneering purpose; we meant what we said in McConnell, and we did not overlook 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence when we said it.  Whereas The Chief Justice says that BCRA &#x93;should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights,&#x94; ante, at 14, we already held in McConnell that the campaign finance law accomplishes precisely that.

In stating the legal standard, McConnell made no mention of any study.  What is the authority, then, for asserting that the studies were pivotal to the standard we announced in McConnell?  See ante, at 12.  Other than WRTL&#x92;s brief, The Chief Justice cites only Judge Henderson&#x92;s separate district court opinion in McConnell.  Ante, at 12.  But The Chief Justice quotes one part of Judge Henderson&#x92;s analysis and neglects to mention that she in turn was quoting the lead author of one of the studies in question: &#x93;According to the Brennan Center, the Buying Time reports were &#x91;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of&#x92; BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions &#x91;in support of their constitutional validity.&#x92; &#x94;  McConnell, 251 F.

For example, The Chief Justice says, there would have been &#x93;no reason&#x94; to think that WRTL&#x92;s ad constituted anything but a pure issue ad if it addressed a bill pending during Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection campaign, such as the Universal National Service Act.  Ante, at 17.  It is revealing, of course, that The Chief Justice does not invoke the filibuster issue, the subject of WRTL&#x92;s ads, as the legislative matter with particular salience during the 2004 election.  But why the reasonable listener can look to Congress but not the calendar on the wall or a WRTL website is difficult to fathom.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-20" href="#ZD-20ref">20</a>Justice Scalia also adopts the same misconception that &#xA7;203 is a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-21" href="#ZD-21ref">21</a> These as-applied challenges provide no reason to second-guess our conclusion in McConnell that the rule for differentiating between electioneering ads and genuine issue ads is administrable.  WRTL&#x92;s ads clearly have an electioneering purpose and, as explained above, fall comfortably within the heartland of electioneering communications that &#xA7;203 may validly regulate.  Thus, although Justice Scalia claims that &#x93;[t]oday&#x92;s cases make it apparent&#x94; that McConnell must be overruled, ante, at 18, there is nothing about today&#x92;s cases that suggests that McConnell is unworkable.  We therefore have no occasion to reconsider McConnell from first principles.

        <p class="bodytext">    The significance and effect of today&#x92;s judgment, from which I respectfully dissent, turn on three things: the demand for campaign money in huge amounts from large contributors, whose power has produced a cynical electorate; the congressional recognition of the ensuing threat to democratic integrity as reflected in a century of legislation restricting the electoral leverage of concentrations of money in corporate and union treasuries; and <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensable ingredient of a political candidacy is money for advertising.  In the 2004 campaign, more than half of the combined expenditures by the two principal presidential candidates (excluding fundraising) went for media time and space.  See The Costliest Campaign, Washington Post, Dec. 30, 2004, p. A7.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">
                <sup>

                </sup>
            </a>  And in the 2005&#x96;2006 election cycle, the expenditure of more than $2 billion on television shattered the previous record, even without a presidential contest.  See Inside Media, MediaWeek, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 18.  The portent is for still greater spending.  By the end of March 2007, almost a year before the first primary and more than 18 months before the general election, presidential candidates had already raised over $150 million.  See Balz, Fundraising Totals Challenge Early Campaign Assumptions, Washington Post, Apr. 17, 2007, p. A1 (citing figures and noting that &#x93;[t]he campaign is living up to its reputation as the most expensive in U. S. history&#x94;).  To reach this total, the leading fundraisers collected over $250,000 per day in the first quarter of 2007, Mullins, Clinton Leads the Money Race, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2007, p. A8, and the eventual nominees are expected to raise $500 million apiece (about $680,000 per day over a 2-year election cycle), Kirkpatrick and Pilhofer, McCain Lags in Income But Excels in Spending, Report Shows, N. Y. Times, Apr. 15, 2007, p. 20.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensability of these huge sums has two significant consequences for American Government that are particularly on point here.  The enormous demands, first, assign power to deep pockets.  See Balz, <em>supra</em>, at A6 (&#x93;For all the interest in Internet fundraising, big donors still ruled in the first quarter, with roughly 80 percent of donations coming in amounts of $1,000 or more&#x94;).  Candidates occasionally boast about the number of contributors they have, but the headlines speaking in dollars reflect political reality.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Mullins, <em>supra</em>, at A8 (headlined &#x93;Clinton Leads the Money Race&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Some major contributors get satisfaction from pitching in for their candidates, but political preference fails to account for the frequency of giving &#x93;substantial sums to <em>both</em> major national parties,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 148, a practice driven &#x93;by stark political pragmatism, not by ideological support for either party or their candidates,&#x94; Brief for Committee for Economic Development et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> in <em>McConnell</em>, O. T. 2003, No. 02&#x96;1674, p. 3 (hereinafter CED Brief).  What the high-dollar pragmatists of either variety get is special access to the officials they help elect, and with it a disproportionate influence on those in power.  See <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em/>at 130&#x96;131.  As the erstwhile officer of a large American corporation put it, &#x93; &#x91;[b]usiness leaders believe&#x97;based on experience and with good reason&#x97;that &#x2026; access gives them an opportunity to shape and affect governmental decisions and that their ability to do so derives from the fact that they have given large sums of money to the parties.&#x92; &#x94;  CED Brief 9.  At a critical level, contributions that underwrite elections are leverage for enormous political influence.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Voters know this.  Hence, the second important consequence of the demand for big money to finance publicity: pervasive public cynicism.  A 2002 poll found that 71 percent of Americans think Members of Congress cast votes based on the views of their big contributors, even when those views differ from the Member&#x92;s own beliefs about what is best for the country.  Mellman &amp; Wirthlin 267; see also <em>id.</em>, at 266 (&#x93;In public opinion research it is uncommon to have 70 percent or more of the public see an issue the same way.  When they do, it indicates an unusually strong agreement on that issue&#x94;).  The same percentage believes that the will of contributors tempts Members to vote against the majority view of their constituents.  <em>Id.</em>, at 267.  Almost half of Americans believe that Members often decide how to vote based on what big contributors to their party want, while only a quarter think Members often base their votes on perceptions of what is best for the country or their constituents.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Devoting concentrations of money in self-interested hands to the support of political campaigning therefore threatens the capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents and the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves.  These are the elements summed up in the notion of political integrity, giving it a value second to none in a free society.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the threat to this value flowing from concentrations of money in politics has reached an unprecedented enormity, it has been gathering force for generations.  Before the turn of the last century, as now, it was obvious that the purchase of influence and the cynicism of voters threaten the integrity and stability of democratic government, each derived from the responsiveness of its law to the interests of citizens and their confidence in that focus.  The danger has traditionally seemed at its apex when no reasonable limits constrain the campaign activities of organizations whose &#x93;unique legal and economic characteristics&#x94; are tailored to &#x93;facilitat[e] the amassing of large treasuries,&#x94; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Thirty years later, new questions about the electoral influence of accumulated wealth surfaced as organized labor expanded during the New Deal.  In the 1936 election, labor unions contributed &#x93;unprecedented&#x94; sums, S. Rep. No. 151, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 127 (1937), the greater part of them by the United Mine Workers, see Campaign Finance Sourcebook 17.  And in due course reaction began to build: &#x93;[w]artime strikes gave rise to fears of the new concentration of power represented by the gains of trade unionism.  And so the belief grew that, just as the great corporations had made huge political contributions to influence governmental action &#x2026; , the powerful unions were pursuing a similar course, and with the same untoward consequences for the democratic process.&#x94;  <em>Automobile Workers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 578.  Congress responded with the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943, which extended the ban on corporate donations to labor organizations, ch. 144, &#xA7;9, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">57</a>Stat.

        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At the same time, Congress had another worry that foreshadows our case today.  It was concerned that the statutory prohibition on corporate &#x93;contribution[s]&#x94; was being so narrowly construed as to open a &#x93;loophole whereby corporations, national banks, and labor organizations are enabled to avoid the obviously intended restrictive policy of the statute by garbing their financial assistance in the form of an &#x91;expenditure&#x92; rather than a contribution.&#x94;  S. Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38&#x96;39 (1947); see also H. Rep. No. 2739, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 40 (1947) (&#x93;The intent and purpose of the provision of the act prohibiting any corporation or labor organization making any contribution in connection with any election would be wholly defeated if it were assumed that the term &#x91;making any contribution&#x92; related only to the donating of money directly to a candidate, and excluded the vast expenditures of money in the activities herein shown to be engaged in extensively.  Of what avail would a law be to prohibit the contributing direct to a candidate and yet permit the expenditure of large sums in his behalf?&#x94;).

        <p class="bodytext">    The new law left open, however, the right of a union to spend money on electioneering from a segregated fund raised specifically for that purpose from members, but not drawn from the general treasury.  Segregated funding entities, the now-familiar political action committees or PACs, had been established prior to Taft-Hartley, and we concluded in <em>Pipefitters</em> v. <em>United States</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    In 1986, in <em>MCFL</em>, we reexamined the longstanding ban on spending corporate and union treasury funds &#x93;in connection with&#x94; federal elections, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/441b.html" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;441b</a>, and drew two conclusions implicated in the present case.  First, we construed the &#x93;in connection with&#x94; phrase in much the same way we had interpreted comparable FECA language challenged in <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
<em>(per curiam)</em>.  We held that to avoid vagueness, the product of prohibited corporate and union expenditures &#x93;must constitute &#x91;express advocacy&#x92; in order to be subject to the prohibition.&#x94;  <em>MCFL</em>, 479 U. S., at 249.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We thus held that the prohibition applied &#x93;only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 44.  &#x93;[E]xpress terms,&#x94; in turn, meant what had already become known as &#x93;magic words,&#x94; such as &#x93; &#x91;vote for,&#x92; &#x91;elect,&#x92; &#x91;support,&#x92; &#x91;cast your ballot for,&#x92; &#x91;Smith for Congress,&#x92; &#x91;vote against,&#x92; &#x91;defeat,&#x92; &#x91;reject.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>,<em/>n. 52.  The consequence of this construction was obvious: it pulled the teeth out of the statute, as we had understood when we announced it in its earlier application in Buckley:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The exacting interpretation of the statutory language necessary to avoid unconstitutional vagueness &#x2026; undermines the limitation&#x92;s effectiveness as a loophole-closing provision by facilitating circumvention by those seeking to exert improper influence upon a candidate or officeholder.  It would naively underestimate the ingenuity and resourcefulness of persons and groups desiring to buy influence to believe that they would have much difficulty devising expenditures that skirted the restriction on express advocacy of election or defeat but nevertheless benefited the candidate&#x92;s campaign.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 45.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nor was the statute, even as thus narrowed, enforceable against the particular advocacy corporation challenging the limit in <em>MCFL</em>.  This was the second holding of <em>MCFL </em>relevant here;<em/>we explained that the congressional effort to limit the political influence of corporate money &#x93;has reflected concern not about use of the corporate form <em>per se</em>, but about the potential for unfair deployment of wealth for political purposes,&#x94; 479 U.

We held that this &#x93;legitima[te]&#x94; concern could not reasonably extend to electioneering expenditures by the corporation at issue in <em>MCFL</em>, which neither &#x93;engage[d] in business activities&#x94; nor accepted donations from business corporations and unions (and thus could not serve as a &#x93;condui[t]&#x94; for political spending by those entities).  <em>Id.</em>, at 263&#x96;264.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>McConnell</em>, we found this definition to be &#x93;easily understood and objectiv[e],&#x94; raising &#x93;none of the vagueness concerns that drove our analysis&#x94; of the statutory language at issue in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em>, 540 U.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  We rejected any suggestion &#x93;that <em>Buckley</em> drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy [with magic words] and so-called issue advocacy [without them], and that speakers possess an inviolable 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to engage in the latter category of speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 190.  To the contrary, we held that &#x93;our decisions in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em> were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 192&#x96;193.  &#x93;[T]he presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech,&#x94; which is prohibitable, &#x93;from a true issue ad,&#x94; we said, since ads that &#x93;esche[w] the use of magic words &#x2026; are no less clearly intended to influence the election.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 193.  We thus found &#x93;[l]ittle difference &#x2026; between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We understood that Congress had a compelling interest in limiting this sort of electioneering by corporations and unions, for &#xA7;203 exemplified a tradition of &#x93;repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U.

Nor did we see any plausible claim of substantial overbreadth from incidentally prohibiting ads genuinely focused on issues rather than elections, given the limitation of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; by time, geographical coverage, and clear reference to candidate.  &#x93;Far from establishing that BCRA&#x92;s application to pure issue ads is substantial, either in an absolute sense or relative to its application to election-related advertising, the record strongly supports the contrary conclusion.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 207.  Finally, we underscored the reasonableness of the &#xA7;203 line by emphasizing that it defined a category of limited, but not prohibited, corporate and union speech: &#x93;Because corporations can still fund electioneering communications with PAC money, it is &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression rather than a regulation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 204 (quoting <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em> v. <em>Beaumont</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    We may add that a nonprofit corporation, no matter what its source of funding, is free to pelt a federal candidate like Jane Doe with criticism or shower her with praise, by name and within days of an election, if it speaks through a newspaper ad or on a website, rather than a &#x93;broadcast, cable, or satellite communication,&#x94;

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, Congress in 1907 prohibited corporate contributions to candidates and in 1943 applied the same ban to unions.  In 1947, Congress extended the complete ban from contributions to expenditures &#x93;in connection with&#x94; an election, a phrase so vague that in 1986 we held it must be confined to instances of express advocacy using magic words.  Congress determined, in 2002, that corporate and union expenditures for fake issue ads devoid of magic words should be regulated using a narrow definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; to reach only broadcast ads that were the practical equivalents of express advocacy.  In 2003, this Court found the provision free from vagueness and justified by the concern that drove its enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This century-long tradition of legislation and judicial precedent rests on facing undeniable facts and testifies to an equally undeniable value.  Campaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries, with no redolence of &#x93;grassroots&#x94; about them.  Neither Congress&#x92;s decisions nor our own have understood the corrupting influence of money in politics as being limited to outright bribery or discrete <em>quid pro quo; </em>campaign finance reform has instead consistently focused on the more pervasive distortion of electoral institutions by concentrated wealth, on the special access and guaranteed favor that sap the representative integrity of American government and defy public confidence in its institutions.  From early in the 20th century through the decision in <em>McConnell</em>, we have acknowledged that the value of democratic integrity justifies a realistic response when corporations and labor organizations commit the concentrated moneys in their treasuries to electioneering.</p>

            </a>  In 2004, WRTL accepted over $315,000 in corporate donations, App. 40, and of its six general fund contributions of $50,000 or more between 2002 and 2005, three, including the largest (for $140,000), came from corporate donors, <em>id.</em>, at 118&#x96;121.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL also runs a PAC, funded by individual donations, which has been active over the years in making independent campaign expenditures, as in the previous two elections involving Senator Feingold.  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  During the 1998 campaign, for example, WRTL&#x92;s PAC spent $60,000 to oppose him.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In 2004, however, despite a sharp nationwide increase in PAC receipts, WRTL focused its fundraising on its corporate treasury, not the PAC, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;43, and took in only $17,000 in PAC contributions, as against over $150,000 during 2000, <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;42.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Throughout the 2004 senatorial campaign, WRTL made no secret of its views about who should win the election and explicitly tied its position to the filibuster issue.  Its PAC issued at least two press releases saying that its &#x93;Top Election Priorities&#x94; were to &#x93;Re-elect George W. Bush&#x94; and &#x93;Send Feingold Packing!&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 78&#x96;80, 82&#x96;84.  In one of these, the Chair of WRTL&#x92;s PAC was quoted as saying, &#x93; &#x91;We do not want Russ Feingold to continue to have the ability to thwart President Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 82&#x96;83.  The Spring 2004 issue of the WRTL PAC&#x92;s quarterly magazine ran an article headlined &#x93;Radically Pro-Abortion Feingold Must Go!&#x94;, which reported that &#x93;Feingold has been active in his opposition to Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees&#x94; and said that &#x93;the defeat of Feingold must be uppermost in the minds of Wisconsin&#x92;s pro-life community in the 2004 elections.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 101&#x96;103.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    It was under these circumstances that WRTL ran the three television and radio ads in question.  The bills for them were not paid by WRTL&#x92;s PAC, but out of the general treasury with its substantial proportion of corporate contributions; in fact, corporations earmarked more than $50,000 specifically to pay for the ads, <em>id.</em>, at 41.  Each one criticized an unnamed &#x93;group of Senators&#x94; for &#x93;using the filibuster delay tactic to block federal judicial nominees from a simple &#x91;yes&#x92; or &#x91;no&#x92; vote,&#x94; and described the Senators&#x92; actions as &#x93;politics at work, causing gridlock and backing up some of our courts to a state of emergency.&#x94;<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>  They exhorted viewers and listeners to &#x93;[c]ontact Senators Feingold and Kohl and tell them to oppose the filibuster,&#x94; but instead of providing a phone number or e-mail address, they told the audience to go to BeFair.org, a website set up by WRTL.  A visit to this website would erase any doubt a listener or viewer might have as to whether Senators Feingold and Kohl were part of the &#x93;group&#x94; condemned in the ads: it displayed a document that criticized the two Senators for voting to filibuster &#x93;16 out of 16 times&#x94; and accused them of &#x93;putting politics into the court system, creating gridlock, and costing taxpayers money.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 86.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL&#x92;s planned airing of the ads had no apparent relation to any Senate filibuster vote but was keyed to the timing of the senatorial election.  WRTL began broadcasting the ads on July 26, 2004, four days after the Senate recessed for the summer, and although the filibuster controversy raged on through 2005, WRTL did not resume running the ads after the election.  <em>Id.</em>, at 29, 32.

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, any Wisconsin voter who paid attention would have known that Democratic Senator Feingold supported filibusters against Republican presidential judicial nominees, that the propriety of the filibusters was a major issue in the senatorial campaign, and that WRTL along with the Senator&#x92;s Republican challengers opposed his reelection because of his position on filibusters.  Any alert voters who heard or saw WRTL&#x92;s ads would have understood that WRTL was telling them that the Senator&#x92;s position on the filibusters should be grounds to vote against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given these facts, it is beyond all reasonable debate that the ads are constitutionally subject to regulation under <em>McConnell</em>.  There, we noted that BCRA was meant to remedy the problem of &#x93;[s]o-called issue ads&#x94; being used &#x93;to advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 126.  We then gave a paradigmatic example of these electioneering ads subject to regulation, saying that &#x93;[l]ittle difference existed . . . between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The WRTL ads were indistinguishable from the Jane Doe ad; they &#x93;condemned [Senator Feingold&#x92;s] record on a particular issue&#x94; and exhorted the public to contact him and &#x93;tell [him] what you think.&#x94;<a name="ZD-16ref" href="#ZD-16" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  And just as anyone who heard the Jane Doe ad would understand that the point was to defeat Doe, anyone who heard the Feingold ads (let alone anyone who went to the website they named) would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.  If it is now unconstitutional to restrict WRTL&#x92;s Feingold ads, then it follows that &#xA7;203 can no longer be applied constitutionally to <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>Jane Doe paradigm.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding that &#xA7;203 is facially constitutional is overruled.  By what steps does the principal opinion reach this unacknowledged result less than four years after <em>McConnell</em> was decided?</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, it lays down a new test to identify a severely limited class of ads that may constitutionally be regulated as electioneering communications, a test that is flatly contrary to <em>McConnell</em>.  An ad is the equivalent of express advocacy and subject to regulation, the opinion says, only if it is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Since the Feingold ads could, in isolation, be read as at least including calls to communicate views on filibusters to the two Senators, those ads cannot be treated as the functional equivalent of express advocacy to elect or defeat anyone, and therefore may not constitutionally be regulated at all.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the same could have been said of the hypothetical Jane Doe ad.  Its spoken message ended with the instruction to tell Doe what the voter thinks.  The same could also have been said of the actual Yellowtail ad.  Yet in <em>McConnell</em>, we gave the Jane Doe ad as the paradigm of a broadcast message that could be constitutionally regulated as election conduct, and we explicitly described the Yellowtail ad as a &#x93;striking example&#x94; of one that was &#x93;clearly intended to influence the election,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 193, and n. 78.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The principal opinion, in other words, simply inverts what we said in <em>McConnell</em>.  While we left open the possibility of a &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure&#x94; issue ad that might not be open to regulation under &#xA7;203, <em>id.</em>, at 206&#x96;207, and n. 88, we meant that an issue ad without campaign advocacy could escape the restriction.  The implication of the adjectives &#x93;genuine&#x94; and &#x93;pure&#x94; is unmistakable: if an ad is reasonably understood as going beyond a discussion of issues (that is, if it can be understood as electoral advocacy), then by definition it is not &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure.&#x94;  But the principal opinion inexplicably wrings the opposite conclusion from those words: if an ad is susceptible to any &#x93;reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; then it must be a &#x93;pure&#x94; or &#x93;genuine&#x94; issue ad.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  This stands <em>McConnell</em> on its head, and on this reasoning it is pos-<span class="softbreak"/>sible that even some ads with magic words could not be regulated.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Second, the principal opinion seems to defend this inversion of <em>McConnell</em> as a necessary alternative to an unadministrable subjective test for the equivalence of express (and regulable) electioneering advocacy.  The principal opinion acknowledges, of course, that in <em>McConnell</em> we said that &#x93;[t]he justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during [the period shortly before an election] if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;  540 U.

            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> were correct that <em>McConnell</em> made the constitutional application of &#xA7;203 contingent on whether a corporation&#x92;s &#x93;motives were pure,&#x94; or its issue advocacy &#x93;subjective[ly] sincer[e],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted), then I, too, might be inclined to reconsider <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s language.  But <em>McConnell</em> did not do that.  It did not purport to draw constitutional lines based on the subjective motivations of corporations (or their principals) sponsoring political ads, but merely described our test for equivalence to express advocacy as resting on the ads&#x92; &#x93;electioneering purpose,&#x94; which will be objectively apparent from those ads&#x92; content and context (as these cases and the examples cited in <em>McConnell </em>readily show).  We therefore held that &#xA7;203 was not substantially overbroad because &#x93;the vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose,&#x94; and consequently could be regulated consistent with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  540 U. S., at 206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, if the studies to which <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> refers were now to inform our reading of <em>McConnell</em>, they would merely underscore the objective character of the proper way to determine whether &#xA7;203 is constitutional as applied to a given ad.  The authors of those studies did not conduct discovery of the &#x93;actua[l] inten[tions],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14, behind any ads; nor, to my knowledge, were the sponsors of campaign ads summoned before researchers to explain their motivations.  The studies merely confirmed that &#x93;reasonable people are &#x2026; able to discern between ads whose primary purpose is to support a candidate and those intended to provide information about a policy issue.&#x94;  J. Krasno &amp; D. Seltz, Buying Time: Television Advertising in the 1998 Congressional Elections 9 (2000).  To be clear, I am not endorsing the precise methodology of those studies (and <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> is correct that we did not do so in <em>McConnell</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13, n. 4); the point is only that the studies relied on a &#x93;reasonable&#x94; person&#x92;s understanding of the ads&#x92; apparent purpose, and thus were no less objective than <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s own approach.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A similarly mistaken fear of an unadministrable and speech-chilling subjective regime seems to underlie <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice&#x92;</span>s unwillingness to acknowledge the part that consideration of an ad&#x92;s context necessarily plays in any realistic assessment of its meaning.  A reasonable Wisconsinite watching or listening to WRTL&#x92;s ads would likely ask and answer some obvious questions about their circumstances.  Is the group that sponsors these ads the same one publicly campaigning against Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection?  <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> says that this information is &#x93;beside the point,&#x94; because WRTL&#x92;s history of overt electioneering only &#x93;goes to [its] subjective intent.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Did these &#x93;issue&#x94; ads begin appearing on the air during the election season, rather than at the time the filibuster &#x93;issue&#x94; was in fact being debated in the Senate?  This, too, is said to be irrelevant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  And does the website to which WRTL&#x92;s ads direct viewers contain material expressly advocating Senator Feingold&#x92;s defeat?  This enquiry is dismissed as being &#x93;one step removed from the text of the ads themselves.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  But these questions are central to the meaning of the ads, and any reasonable person would take account of circumstances in coming to understand the object of WRTL&#x92;s ad.  And why not?  Each of the contextual facts here can be established by an objective look at a public record; none requires a voter (or a litigant) to engage in discovery of evidence about WRTL&#x92;s operations or internal communications, and none goes to a hidden state of mind.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This refusal to see and hear what any listener to WRTL&#x92;s ads would actually consider produces a rule no different in practice from the one adopted by the District Court, which declined to look beyond the &#x93;four corners&#x94; of the ads themselves.  466 F. Supp. 2d 195, 207 (DC 2006).  Although <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> ostensibly stops short of categorically foreclosing consideration of context, see <em>ante</em>, at 20, the application of his test here makes it difficult to see how relevant contextual evidence could ever be taken into account the way it was in <em>McConnell</em>,<a name="ZD-19ref" href="#ZD-19" class="">

            </a> and it is hard to imagine <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> would ever find an ad to be &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16, unless it contained words of express advocacy.  <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> thus effectively reinstates the same toothless &#x93;magic words&#x94; criterion of regulable electioneering that led Congress to enact BCRA in the first place.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Third, it may be that the principal opinion rejects <em>McConnell </em>on the erroneous assumption that &#xA7;203 flatly bans independent electioneering communications by a corporation.  <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> argues that corporations must receive &#x93;the benefit of any doubt,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16,<em/>whenever we undertake the task of &#x93;separating &#x2026; political speech protected under the

But this is a fundamental misconception of the task at hand:  we have already held that it is &#x93; &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression,&#x94; because PAC financing provides corporations &#x93;with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy.&#x94;<a name="ZD-20ref" href="#ZD-20" class="">

            <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 203&#x96;204 (quoting <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 162).  Thus, a successful as-applied challenger to &#xA7;203 should necessarily show, at the least, that it could not constitutionally be subjected to the administrative rules that govern a PAC&#x92;s formation and operation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 163.  This would be an uphill fight, after our repeated affirmations that the PAC structure does not impose excessive burdens, <em>ibid.</em> (citing <em>National Right to Work Comm.</em>, 459 U. S., at 201&#x96;202), and WRTL has a particularly weak position on this point: it set up its own PAC long before the 2004 election, used it to campaign openly against Senator Feingold in the past, and could have raised noncorporate donations to it in the 2004 election cycle.  Any argument that establishing and maintaining a PAC is unconstitutionally burdensome for WRTL would thus likely be futile, and certainly should not prevail on WRTL&#x92;s summary judgment motion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, even without the PAC alternative, it would be untrue that &#xA7;203 &#x93;banned&#x94; WRTL from saying anything a genuine issue ad would say, for WRTL could have availed itself of either or both of the following additional options.  It is undisputed that WRTL&#x92;s ads could have been broadcast lawfully in the runup to the election (and bankrolled from WRTL&#x92;s general treasury) if Senator Feingold&#x92;s name had been omitted and the Senator not otherwise singled out.  Since members of today&#x92;s majority apparently view WRTL&#x92;s broadcasts either as &#x93;genuine issue ad[s],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16 (opinion of <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>), or as &#x93;lobby[ing] Wisconsin voters concerning the filibustering of the President&#x92;s judicial nominees,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 2 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.,</span> concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a claim that omitting Senator Feingold&#x92;s name would &#x93;ban&#x94; WRTL&#x92;s message is specious.  Yet one searches my Brothers&#x92; opinions in vain for any persuasive reason why substituting the phrase &#x93;Contact your Senators&#x94; for the phrase &#x93;Contact Senators Feingold and Kohl&#x94; would have denied WRTL a constitutionally sufficient (and clearly lawful) alternative way to send its message.  If WRTL is to be believed when it claims that the issue was the point of the ads, it would have lost nothing by referring simply to the &#x93;Senators.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the suggestion that &#xA7;203 is a ban on political speech is belied by <em>MCFL</em>&#x92;s safe harbor for nonprofit advocacy corporations: under that rule, WRTL would have been free to attack Senator Feingold by name at any time with ads funded from its corporate treasury, if it had not also chosen to serve as a funnel for hundreds of thousands of dollars from other corporations.  Thus, what is called a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech is a limit on the financing of electioneering broadcasts by entities that refuse to take advantage of the PAC structure but insist on acting as conduits from the campaign war chests of business corporations.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, <em>McConnell</em> does not graft a subjective standard onto campaign regulation, the context of campaign advertising cannot sensibly be ignored, and &#xA7;203 is not a ban on speech.  What cannot be gainsaid, in any event, is that in treating these subjects as it does, the operative opinion produces the result of overruling <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding on &#xA7;203, less than four years in the Reports.  Anyone who doubts that need merely ask what the law would have been if, back in 2003, this Court had held &#xA7;203 facially unconstitutional.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    BCRA&#x92;s definition of &#x93;electioneering communication,&#x94; which identifies the communications regulable under &#xA7;203, includes a backup to be used if the primary definition &#x93;is held to be constitutionally insufficient by final judicial decision to support the regulation provided herein.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_A_ii" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(A)(ii)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If this should occur, &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; is to be defined as </p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This backup sounds familiar because it is essentially identical to <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s test for evaluating an as-applied challenge to the original definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94;: regulation is permissible only if the communication is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16.  Thus does the principal opinion institute the very standard that would have prevailed if the Court formally overruled <em>McConnell</em>.  There is neither a theoretical nor a practical basis to claim that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s treatment of &#xA7;203 survives.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">E</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The price of <em>McConnell&#x92;</em>s<em/>demise as authority on &#xA7;203 seems to me to be a high one.  The Court (and, I think, the country) loses when important precedent is overruled without good reason, and there is no justification for departing from our usual rule of <em>stare decisis</em> here.  The same combination of alternatives that was available to corporations affected by <em>McConnell</em> in 2003 is available today: WRTL could have run a newspaper ad, could have paid for the broadcast ads through its PAC, could have established itself as an <em>MCFL</em> organization free of corporate money, and could have said &#x93;call your Senators&#x94; instead of naming Senator Feingold in its ads broadcasted just before the election.  Nothing in the related law surrounding &#xA7;203 has changed in any way, let alone in any way that undermines <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>rationale.  See <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Nor can any serious argument be made that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding has been &#x93;unworkable in practice.&#x94;  <em>Allied-Signal, Inc.</em> v. <em>Director, Div. of Taxation</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, it goes without saying that nothing has changed about the facts.  In Justice Frankfurter&#x92;s words, they demonstrate a threat to &#x93;the integrity of our electoral process,&#x94; <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 570, which for a century now Congress has repeatedly found to be imperiled by corporate, and later union, money: witness the Tillman Act, Taft-Hartley, FECA, and BCRA.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  <em>McConnell </em>was our latest decision vindicating clear and reasonable boundaries that Congress has drawn to limit &#x93; &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth,&#x92; &#x94; 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660), and the decision could claim the justification of ongoing fact as well as decisional history in recognizing Congress&#x92;s authority to protect the integrity of elections from the distortion of corporate and union funds.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After today, the ban on contributions by corporations and unions and the limitation on their corrosive spending when they enter the political arena are open to easy circumvention, and the possibilities for regulating corporate and union campaign money are unclear.  The ban on contributions will mean nothing much, now that companies and unions can save candidates the expense of advertising directly, simply by running &#x93;issue ads&#x94; without express advocacy, or by funneling the money through an independent corporation like WRTL.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the understanding of the voters and the Congress that this kind of corporate and union spending seriously jeopardizes the integrity of democratic government will remain.  The facts are too powerful to be ignored, and further efforts at campaign finance reform will come.  It is only the legal landscape that now is altered, and it may be that today&#x92;s departure from precedent will drive further reexamination of the constitutional analysis: of the distinction between contributions and expenditures, or the relation between spending and speech, which have given structure to our thinking since <em>Buckley</em> itself was decided.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    I cannot tell what the future will force upon us, but I respectfully dissent from this judgment today.</p>

Bellotti, however, concerned corporate spending in connection with a referendum, and we went out of our way in that case to avoid casting any doubt upon the constitutionality of limiting corporate expenditures during candidate elections.  We said:


&#x93;The overriding concern behind the enactment of [the federal restrictions on corporate contributions and expenditures] was the problem of corruption of elected representatives through the creation of political debts.  The importance of the governmental interest in preventing this occurrence has never been doubted.  The case before us presents no comparable problem, and our consideration of a corporation&#x92;s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.  Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.&#x94;  435 U.

S., at 259, n. 12.  So Austin did not &#x93;stra[y]&#x94; from Bellotti, ante, at 7 (opinion of Scalia, J.); the reasons Bellotti was not controlling in Austin had been clearly foreshadowed in Bellotti itself and confirmed repeatedly in our decisions leading up to Austin.

&#x93;Especially beginning in 1996, issue advocacy during the campaign season dramatically expanded in Wisconsin.
.....


&#x93;The Commission concludes that, in each of these cases, the expenditures were clearly campaign-oriented activities.  They were quite clearly designed to influence the electoral process.  They were focused either on electing or defeating a candidate.  The Commission bases this conclusion on the following points:


&#x93;Although those paying for the activities claimed they were aimed solely at educating voters on the issues, they each mentioned the names of candidates for office.


&#x93;They occurred only when election races were in progress that involved a contest between an incumbent and a challenger.  When the election was over, the activities ended.


&#x93;The activity has occurred after legislative sessions when the issues about which advocacy was occurring were not being deliberated by the legislature.


&#x93;The activity occurred in campaign season, between the candidate&#x92;s filing for candidacy and election time.  Advertisements of this sort have tended to occur at virtually no other time.


&#x93;The activity involved the electronic media, mass mailings, or centrally located telephone banks.
.....


&#x93;The explosive growth of campaign-based advocacy, without even disclosure of its activities and funding sources, poses a grave risk to the integrity of elections. It has created a two-tiered campaign process: one, based in candidates and political parties, which is tightly regulated and controlled; the other, based in interest group activity under the guise of &#x91;issue advocacy&#x92; but actually quite clearly election-focused, which lies beyond accountability.&#x94;  1 Governor&#x92;s Blue-Ribbon Commission on Campaign Finance Reform, State of Wisconsin: Report of the Commission, available at http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
 (per curiam), &#x93;already rejected&#x94; any test that calls for an assessment of the intent and effect of corporate electioneering.  Ante, at 13.  The &#x93;reject[ion]&#x94; to which The Chief Justice presumably refers is Buckley&#x92;s quotation of Thomas v. Collins, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/516" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 516</a> (1945)
, where we found impermissibly vague a statute that permitted a union leader to &#x93; &#x91;laud unionism&#x92; &#x94; but forbade him to &#x93;imply an invitation&#x94; to join a union.  Id., at 534.  The problem with this predicament, we reasoned, was the lack of a clearly permissible opportunity for expression:  Whether words &#x93;designed to fall short of invitation would miss that mark is a question both of intent and of effect,&#x94; and no speaker &#x93;safely could assume that anything he might say &#x2026; would not be understood by some as an invitation.&#x94;  Id., at 535.  We then specified that the speaker in Thomas was left with an impermissibly limited universe of &#x93;three choices: (1) to stand on his right and speak freely; (2) to quit, refusing entirely to speak; (3) to trim, and even thus to risk the penalty.&#x94;  Id., at 536.


The Chief Justice implies that considering the intent and effect of corporate advertising during as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203 would put corporations in precisely the same bind; thus, he wonders how McConnell could use the language of intent and effect without &#x93;even address[ing] what Buckley&#x94; (and by extension, Thomas) &#x93;had to say on the subject.&#x94;  Ante, at 14.  But one need not look far in our McConnell opinion to understand why we thought that corporations have more than the constrained set of options available to the union leader in Thomas.  Just a few sentences after holding that ads with electioneering intent and effect are regulable, we gave this explanation: &#x93;in the future corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads [shortly before an election] by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.  In other words, corporations can find refuge in constitutionally sufficient and clearly delineated safe harbors by modifying the content of their ads (by omitting a candidate&#x92;s name) or by altering the sources of their ads&#x92; financing (from general treasuries to PACs).  The Chief Justice thus wrongly jettisons our conclusions about the constitutionality of regulating ads with electioneering purpose; we meant what we said in McConnell, and we did not overlook 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence when we said it.  Whereas The Chief Justice says that BCRA &#x93;should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights,&#x94; ante, at 14, we already held in McConnell that the campaign finance law accomplishes precisely that.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-18" href="#ZD-18ref">18</a> The Chief Justice speculates that McConnell derived its test for functional equivalence from &#x93;[t]wo key studies,&#x94; ante, at 12, but not a shred of language in McConnell supports that theory.  In stating the legal standard, McConnell made no mention of any study.  What is the authority, then, for asserting that the studies were pivotal to the standard we announced in McConnell?  See ante, at 12.  Other than WRTL&#x92;s brief, The Chief Justice cites only Judge Henderson&#x92;s separate district court opinion in McConnell.  Ante, at 12.  But The Chief Justice quotes one part of Judge Henderson&#x92;s analysis and neglects to mention that she in turn was quoting the lead author of one of the studies in question: &#x93;According to the Brennan Center, the Buying Time reports were &#x91;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of&#x92; BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions &#x91;in support of their constitutional validity.&#x92; &#x94;  McConnell, 251 F.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-19" href="#ZD-19ref">19</a> Like the District Court, the only bit of context The Chief Justice would allow the reasonable listener is the congressional agenda: whether the &#x93; &#x91;issue&#x92; &#x94; addressed in an ad currently is, or soon will be, &#x93; &#x91;the subject of legislative scrutiny.&#x92; &#x94;  Ante, at 20 (quoting 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 207).  For example, The Chief Justice says, there would have been &#x93;no reason&#x94; to think that WRTL&#x92;s ad constituted anything but a pure issue ad if it addressed a bill pending during Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection campaign, such as the Universal National Service Act.  Ante, at 17.  It is revealing, of course, that The Chief Justice does not invoke the filibuster issue, the subject of WRTL&#x92;s ads, as the legislative matter with particular salience during the 2004 election.  But why the reasonable listener can look to Congress but not the calendar on the wall or a WRTL website is difficult to fathom.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-20" href="#ZD-20ref">20</a>Justice Scalia also adopts the same misconception that &#xA7;203 is a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech.  See ante, at 18 (&#x93;Section 203&#x92;s line is bright, but it bans vast amounts of political advocacy indistinguishable from hitherto protected speech&#x94;).
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-21" href="#ZD-21ref">21</a> These as-applied challenges provide no reason to second-guess our conclusion in McConnell that the rule for differentiating between electioneering ads and genuine issue ads is administrable.  WRTL&#x92;s ads clearly have an electioneering purpose and, as explained above, fall comfortably within the heartland of electioneering communications that &#xA7;203 may validly regulate.  Thus, although Justice Scalia claims that &#x93;[t]oday&#x92;s cases make it apparent&#x94; that McConnell must be overruled, ante, at 18, there is nothing about today&#x92;s cases that suggests that McConnell is unworkable.  We therefore have no occasion to reconsider McConnell from first principles.

        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensable ingredient of a political candidacy is money for advertising.  In the 2004 campaign, more than half of the combined expenditures by the two principal presidential candidates (excluding fundraising) went for media time and space.  See The Costliest Campaign, Washington Post, Dec. 30, 2004, p. A7.<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>2</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And in the 2005&#x96;2006 election cycle, the expenditure of more than $2 billion on television shattered the previous record, even without a presidential contest.  See Inside Media, MediaWeek, Nov. 20, 2006, p. 18.  The portent is for still greater spending.  By the end of March 2007, almost a year before the first primary and more than 18 months before the general election, presidential candidates had already raised over $150 million.  See Balz, Fundraising Totals Challenge Early Campaign Assumptions, Washington Post, Apr. 17, 2007, p. A1 (citing figures and noting that &#x93;[t]he campaign is living up to its reputation as the most expensive in U. S. history&#x94;).  To reach this total, the leading fundraisers collected over $250,000 per day in the first quarter of 2007, Mullins, Clinton Leads the Money Race, Wall Street Journal, Apr. 16, 2007, p. A8, and the eventual nominees are expected to raise $500 million apiece (about $680,000 per day over a 2-year election cycle), Kirkpatrick and Pilhofer, McCain Lags in Income But Excels in Spending, Report Shows, N. Y. Times, Apr. 15, 2007, p. 20.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The indispensability of these huge sums has two significant consequences for American Government that are particularly on point here.  The enormous demands, first, assign power to deep pockets.  See Balz, <em>supra</em>, at A6 (&#x93;For all the interest in Internet fundraising, big donors still ruled in the first quarter, with roughly 80 percent of donations coming in amounts of $1,000 or more&#x94;).  Candidates occasionally boast about the number of contributors they have, but the headlines speaking in dollars reflect political reality.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Mullins, <em>supra</em>, at A8 (headlined &#x93;Clinton Leads the Money Race&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Some major contributors get satisfaction from pitching in for their candidates, but political preference fails to account for the frequency of giving &#x93;substantial sums to <em>both</em> major national parties,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 148, a practice driven &#x93;by stark political pragmatism, not by ideological support for either party or their candidates,&#x94; Brief for Committee for Economic Development et al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> in <em>McConnell</em>, O. T. 2003, No. 02&#x96;1674, p. 3 (hereinafter CED Brief).  What the high-dollar pragmatists of either variety get is special access to the officials they help elect, and with it a disproportionate influence on those in power.  See <em>McConnell</em>, <em>supra</em>,<em/>at 130&#x96;131.  As the erstwhile officer of a large American corporation put it, &#x93; &#x91;[b]usiness leaders believe&#x97;based on experience and with good reason&#x97;that &#x2026; access gives them an opportunity to shape and affect governmental decisions and that their ability to do so derives from the fact that they have given large sums of money to the parties.&#x92; &#x94;  CED Brief 9.  At a critical level, contributions that underwrite elections are leverage for enormous political influence.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Voters know this.  Hence, the second important consequence of the demand for big money to finance publicity: pervasive public cynicism.  A 2002 poll found that 71 percent of Americans think Members of Congress cast votes based on the views of their big contributors, even when those views differ from the Member&#x92;s own beliefs about what is best for the country.  Mellman &amp; Wirthlin 267; see also <em>id.</em>, at 266 (&#x93;In public opinion research it is uncommon to have 70 percent or more of the public see an issue the same way.  When they do, it indicates an unusually strong agreement on that issue&#x94;).  The same percentage believes that the will of contributors tempts Members to vote against the majority view of their constituents.  <em>Id.</em>, at 267.  Almost half of Americans believe that Members often decide how to vote based on what big contributors to their party want, while only a quarter think Members often base their votes on perceptions of what is best for the country or their constituents.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Devoting concentrations of money in self-interested hands to the support of political campaigning therefore threatens the capacity of this democracy to represent its constituents and the confidence of its citizens in their capacity to govern themselves.  These are the elements summed up in the notion of political integrity, giving it a value second to none in a free society.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If the threat to this value flowing from concentrations of money in politics has reached an unprecedented enormity, it has been gathering force for generations.  Before the turn of the last century, as now, it was obvious that the purchase of influence and the cynicism of voters threaten the integrity and stability of democratic government, each derived from the responsiveness of its law to the interests of citizens and their confidence in that focus.  The danger has traditionally seemed at its apex when no reasonable limits constrain the campaign activities of organizations whose &#x93;unique legal and economic characteristics&#x94; are tailored to &#x93;facilitat[e] the amassing of large treasuries,&#x94; <em>Austin</em> v. <em>Michigan Chamber of Commerce</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Thirty years later, new questions about the electoral influence of accumulated wealth surfaced as organized labor expanded during the New Deal.  In the 1936 election, labor unions contributed &#x93;unprecedented&#x94; sums, S. Rep. No. 151, 75th Cong., 1st Sess., 127 (1937), the greater part of them by the United Mine Workers, see Campaign Finance Sourcebook 17.  And in due course reaction began to build: &#x93;[w]artime strikes gave rise to fears of the new concentration of power represented by the gains of trade unionism.  And so the belief grew that, just as the great corporations had made huge political contributions to influence governmental action &#x2026; , the powerful unions were pursuing a similar course, and with the same untoward consequences for the democratic process.&#x94;  <em>Automobile Workers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 578.  Congress responded with the War Labor Disputes Act of 1943, which extended the ban on corporate donations to labor organizations, ch. 144, &#xA7;9,

        <p class="bodytext">    At the same time, Congress had another worry that foreshadows our case today.  It was concerned that the statutory prohibition on corporate &#x93;contribution[s]&#x94; was being so narrowly construed as to open a &#x93;loophole whereby corporations, national banks, and labor organizations are enabled to avoid the obviously intended restrictive policy of the statute by garbing their financial assistance in the form of an &#x91;expenditure&#x92; rather than a contribution.&#x94;  S. Rep. No. 1, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., 38&#x96;39 (1947); see also H. Rep. No. 2739, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 40 (1947) (&#x93;The intent and purpose of the provision of the act prohibiting any corporation or labor organization making any contribution in connection with any election would be wholly defeated if it were assumed that the term &#x91;making any contribution&#x92; related only to the donating of money directly to a candidate, and excluded the vast expenditures of money in the activities herein shown to be engaged in extensively.  Of what avail would a law be to prohibit the contributing direct to a candidate and yet permit the expenditure of large sums in his behalf?&#x94;).

        <p class="bodytext">    We thus held that the prohibition applied &#x93;only to expenditures for communications that in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate for federal office.&#x94;  <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U.

        <p class="bodytext">    An issue ad is an advertisement on a political subject urging the reader or listener to let a politician know what he thinks, but containing no magic words telling the recipient to vote for or against anyone.

Experience showed, however, just what we foresaw in <em>Buckley</em>, that the line between &#x93;issue&#x94; broadcasts and outright electioneering was a patent fiction, as in the example of a television &#x93;issue ad&#x94; that ran during a Montana congressional race between Republican Rick Hill and Democrat Bill Yellowtail in 1996:</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>McConnell</em>, we found this definition to be &#x93;easily understood and objectiv[e],&#x94; raising &#x93;none of the vagueness concerns that drove our analysis&#x94; of the statutory language at issue in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em>, 540 U.

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  We rejected any suggestion &#x93;that <em>Buckley</em> drew a constitutionally mandated line between express advocacy [with magic words] and so-called issue advocacy [without them], and that speakers possess an inviolable 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> right to engage in the latter category of speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 190.  To the contrary, we held that &#x93;our decisions in <em>Buckley</em> and <em>MCFL</em> were specific to the statutory language before us; they in no way drew a constitutional boundary that forever fixed the permissible scope of provisions regulating campaign-related speech.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 192&#x96;193.  &#x93;[T]he presence or absence of magic words cannot meaningfully distinguish electioneering speech,&#x94; which is prohibitable, &#x93;from a true issue ad,&#x94; we said, since ads that &#x93;esche[w] the use of magic words &#x2026; are no less clearly intended to influence the election.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 193.  We thus found &#x93;[l]ittle difference &#x2026; between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We understood that Congress had a compelling interest in limiting this sort of electioneering by corporations and unions, for &#xA7;203 exemplified a tradition of &#x93;repeatedly sustained legislation aimed at &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to the public&#x92;s support for the corporation&#x92;s political ideas.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660).  Nor did we see any plausible claim of substantial overbreadth from incidentally prohibiting ads genuinely focused on issues rather than elections, given the limitation of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; by time, geographical coverage, and clear reference to candidate.  &#x93;Far from establishing that BCRA&#x92;s application to pure issue ads is substantial, either in an absolute sense or relative to its application to election-related advertising, the record strongly supports the contrary conclusion.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 207.  Finally, we underscored the reasonableness of the &#xA7;203 line by emphasizing that it defined a category of limited, but not prohibited, corporate and union speech: &#x93;Because corporations can still fund electioneering communications with PAC money, it is &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression rather than a regulation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 204 (quoting <em>Federal Election Comm&#x92;n</em> v. <em>Beaumont</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    We may add that a nonprofit corporation, no matter what its source of funding, is free to pelt a federal candidate like Jane Doe with criticism or shower her with praise, by name and within days of an election, if it speaks through a newspaper ad or on a website, rather than a &#x93;broadcast, cable, or satellite communication,&#x94;

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, Congress in 1907 prohibited corporate contributions to candidates and in 1943 applied the same ban to unions.  In 1947, Congress extended the complete ban from contributions to expenditures &#x93;in connection with&#x94; an election, a phrase so vague that in 1986 we held it must be confined to instances of express advocacy using magic words.  Congress determined, in 2002, that corporate and union expenditures for fake issue ads devoid of magic words should be regulated using a narrow definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; to reach only broadcast ads that were the practical equivalents of express advocacy.  In 2003, this Court found the provision free from vagueness and justified by the concern that drove its enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This century-long tradition of legislation and judicial precedent rests on facing undeniable facts and testifies to an equally undeniable value.  Campaign finance reform has been a series of reactions to documented threats to electoral integrity obvious to any voter, posed by large sums of money from corporate or union treasuries, with no redolence of &#x93;grassroots&#x94; about them.  Neither Congress&#x92;s decisions nor our own have understood the corrupting influence of money in politics as being limited to outright bribery or discrete <em>quid pro quo; </em>campaign finance reform has instead consistently focused on the more pervasive distortion of electoral institutions by concentrated wealth, on the special access and guaranteed favor that sap the representative integrity of American government and defy public confidence in its institutions.  From early in the 20th century through the decision in <em>McConnell</em>, we have acknowledged that the value of democratic integrity justifies a realistic response when corporations and labor organizations commit the concentrated moneys in their treasuries to electioneering.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Throughout the 2004 senatorial campaign, WRTL made no secret of its views about who should win the election and explicitly tied its position to the filibuster issue.  Its PAC issued at least two press releases saying that its &#x93;Top Election Priorities&#x94; were to &#x93;Re-elect George W. Bush&#x94; and &#x93;Send Feingold Packing!&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 78&#x96;80, 82&#x96;84.  In one of these, the Chair of WRTL&#x92;s PAC was quoted as saying, &#x93; &#x91;We do not want Russ Feingold to continue to have the ability to thwart President Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 82&#x96;83.  The Spring 2004 issue of the WRTL PAC&#x92;s quarterly magazine ran an article headlined &#x93;Radically Pro-Abortion Feingold Must Go!&#x94;, which reported that &#x93;Feingold has been active in his opposition to Bush&#x92;s judicial nominees&#x94; and said that &#x93;the defeat of Feingold must be uppermost in the minds of Wisconsin&#x92;s pro-life community in the 2004 elections.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 101&#x96;103.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    It was under these circumstances that WRTL ran the three television and radio ads in question.  The bills for them were not paid by WRTL&#x92;s PAC, but out of the general treasury with its substantial proportion of corporate contributions; in fact, corporations earmarked more than $50,000 specifically to pay for the ads, <em>id.</em>, at 41.  Each one criticized an unnamed &#x93;group of Senators&#x94; for &#x93;using the filibuster delay tactic to block federal judicial nominees from a simple &#x91;yes&#x92; or &#x91;no&#x92; vote,&#x94; and described the Senators&#x92; actions as &#x93;politics at work, causing gridlock and backing up some of our courts to a state of emergency.&#x94;<a name="ZD-13ref" href="#ZD-13" class="">

            </a>  They exhorted viewers and listeners to &#x93;[c]ontact Senators Feingold and Kohl and tell them to oppose the filibuster,&#x94; but instead of providing a phone number or e-mail address, they told the audience to go to BeFair.org, a website set up by WRTL.  A visit to this website would erase any doubt a listener or viewer might have as to whether Senators Feingold and Kohl were part of the &#x93;group&#x94; condemned in the ads: it displayed a document that criticized the two Senators for voting to filibuster &#x93;16 out of 16 times&#x94; and accused them of &#x93;putting politics into the court system, creating gridlock, and costing taxpayers money.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 86.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    WRTL&#x92;s planned airing of the ads had no apparent relation to any Senate filibuster vote but was keyed to the timing of the senatorial election.  WRTL began broadcasting the ads on July 26, 2004, four days after the Senate recessed for the summer, and although the filibuster controversy raged on through 2005, WRTL did not resume running the ads after the election.  <em>Id.</em>, at 29, 32.  During the campaign period that the ads did cover, Senator Feingold&#x92;s support of the filibusters was a prominent issue.  His position was well known,<a name="ZD-14ref" href="#ZD-14" class="">
                <sup>

            </a> and his Republican opponents, who vocally opposed the filibusters, made the issue a major talking point in their campaigns against him.<a name="ZD-15ref" href="#ZD-15" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, any Wisconsin voter who paid attention would have known that Democratic Senator Feingold supported filibusters against Republican presidential judicial nominees, that the propriety of the filibusters was a major issue in the senatorial campaign, and that WRTL along with the Senator&#x92;s Republican challengers opposed his reelection because of his position on filibusters.  Any alert voters who heard or saw WRTL&#x92;s ads would have understood that WRTL was telling them that the Senator&#x92;s position on the filibusters should be grounds to vote against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Given these facts, it is beyond all reasonable debate that the ads are constitutionally subject to regulation under <em>McConnell</em>.  There, we noted that BCRA was meant to remedy the problem of &#x93;[s]o-called issue ads&#x94; being used &#x93;to advocate the election or defeat of clearly identified federal candidates.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 126.  We then gave a paradigmatic example of these electioneering ads subject to regulation, saying that &#x93;[l]ittle difference existed . . . between an ad that urged viewers to &#x91;vote against Jane Doe&#x92; and one that condemned Jane Doe&#x92;s record on a particular issue before exhorting viewers to &#x91;call Jane Doe and tell her what you think.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 126&#x96;127.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The WRTL ads were indistinguishable from the Jane Doe ad; they &#x93;condemned [Senator Feingold&#x92;s] record on a particular issue&#x94; and exhorted the public to contact him and &#x93;tell [him] what you think.&#x94;<a name="ZD-16ref" href="#ZD-16" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>16</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And just as anyone who heard the Jane Doe ad would understand that the point was to defeat Doe, anyone who heard the Feingold ads (let alone anyone who went to the website they named) would know that WRTL&#x92;s message was to vote against Feingold.  If it is now unconstitutional to restrict WRTL&#x92;s Feingold ads, then it follows that &#xA7;203 can no longer be applied constitutionally to <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>Jane Doe paradigm.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding that &#xA7;203 is facially constitutional is overruled.  By what steps does the principal opinion reach this unacknowledged result less than four years after <em>McConnell</em> was decided?</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, it lays down a new test to identify a severely limited class of ads that may constitutionally be regulated as electioneering communications, a test that is flatly contrary to <em>McConnell</em>.  An ad is the equivalent of express advocacy and subject to regulation, the opinion says, only if it is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  Since the Feingold ads could, in isolation, be read as at least including calls to communicate views on filibusters to the two Senators, those ads cannot be treated as the functional equivalent of express advocacy to elect or defeat anyone, and therefore may not constitutionally be regulated at all.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the same could have been said of the hypothetical Jane Doe ad.  Its spoken message ended with the instruction to tell Doe what the voter thinks.  The same could also have been said of the actual Yellowtail ad.  Yet in <em>McConnell</em>, we gave the Jane Doe ad as the paradigm of a broadcast message that could be constitutionally regulated as election conduct, and we explicitly described the Yellowtail ad as a &#x93;striking example&#x94; of one that was &#x93;clearly intended to influence the election,&#x94; <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 193, and n. 78.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The principal opinion, in other words, simply inverts what we said in <em>McConnell</em>.  While we left open the possibility of a &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure&#x94; issue ad that might not be open to regulation under &#xA7;203, <em>id.</em>, at 206&#x96;207, and n. 88, we meant that an issue ad without campaign advocacy could escape the restriction.  The implication of the adjectives &#x93;genuine&#x94; and &#x93;pure&#x94; is unmistakable: if an ad is reasonably understood as going beyond a discussion of issues (that is, if it can be understood as electoral advocacy), then by definition it is not &#x93;genuine&#x94; or &#x93;pure.&#x94;  But the principal opinion inexplicably wrings the opposite conclusion from those words: if an ad is susceptible to any &#x93;reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; then it must be a &#x93;pure&#x94; or &#x93;genuine&#x94; issue ad.  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  This stands <em>McConnell</em> on its head, and on this reasoning it is pos-<span class="softbreak"/>sible that even some ads with magic words could not be regulated.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Second, the principal opinion seems to defend this inversion of <em>McConnell</em> as a necessary alternative to an unadministrable subjective test for the equivalence of express (and regulable) electioneering advocacy.  The principal opinion acknowledges, of course, that in <em>McConnell</em> we said that &#x93;[t]he justifications for the regulation of express advocacy apply equally to ads aired during [the period shortly before an election] if the ads are intended to influence the voters&#x92; decisions and have that effect.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.  But <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> says that statement in <em>McConnell</em> cannot be accepted at face value because we could not, consistent with precedent, have focused our 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> enquiry on whether &#x93;the speaker actually intended to affect an election.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.<a name="ZD-17ref" href="#ZD-17" class="">

            <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> suggests it is more likely that the <em>McConnell</em> opinion inadvertently borrowed the language of &#x93;intended &#x2026; effect[s],&#x94; 540 U.

        <p class="bodytext">    If <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> were correct that <em>McConnell</em> made the constitutional application of &#xA7;203 contingent on whether a corporation&#x92;s &#x93;motives were pure,&#x94; or its issue advocacy &#x93;subjective[ly] sincer[e],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted), then I, too, might be inclined to reconsider <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s language.  But <em>McConnell</em> did not do that.  It did not purport to draw constitutional lines based on the subjective motivations of corporations (or their principals) sponsoring political ads, but merely described our test for equivalence to express advocacy as resting on the ads&#x92; &#x93;electioneering purpose,&#x94; which will be objectively apparent from those ads&#x92; content and context (as these cases and the examples cited in <em>McConnell </em>readily show).  We therefore held that &#xA7;203 was not substantially overbroad because &#x93;the vast majority of ads clearly had such a purpose,&#x94; and consequently could be regulated consistent with the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  540 U. S., at 206.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, if the studies to which <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> refers were now to inform our reading of <em>McConnell</em>, they would merely underscore the objective character of the proper way to determine whether &#xA7;203 is constitutional as applied to a given ad.  The authors of those studies did not conduct discovery of the &#x93;actua[l] inten[tions],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 14, behind any ads; nor, to my knowledge, were the sponsors of campaign ads summoned before researchers to explain their motivations.  The studies merely confirmed that &#x93;reasonable people are &#x2026; able to discern between ads whose primary purpose is to support a candidate and those intended to provide information about a policy issue.&#x94;  J. Krasno &amp; D. Seltz, Buying Time: Television Advertising in the 1998 Congressional Elections 9 (2000).  To be clear, I am not endorsing the precise methodology of those studies (and <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> is correct that we did not do so in <em>McConnell</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 13, n. 4); the point is only that the studies relied on a &#x93;reasonable&#x94; person&#x92;s understanding of the ads&#x92; apparent purpose, and thus were no less objective than <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s own approach.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A similarly mistaken fear of an unadministrable and speech-chilling subjective regime seems to underlie <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice&#x92;</span>s unwillingness to acknowledge the part that consideration of an ad&#x92;s context necessarily plays in any realistic assessment of its meaning.  A reasonable Wisconsinite watching or listening to WRTL&#x92;s ads would likely ask and answer some obvious questions about their circumstances.  Is the group that sponsors these ads the same one publicly campaigning against Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection?  <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> says that this information is &#x93;beside the point,&#x94; because WRTL&#x92;s history of overt electioneering only &#x93;goes to [its] subjective intent.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Did these &#x93;issue&#x94; ads begin appearing on the air during the election season, rather than at the time the filibuster &#x93;issue&#x94; was in fact being debated in the Senate?  This, too, is said to be irrelevant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  And does the website to which WRTL&#x92;s ads direct viewers contain material expressly advocating Senator Feingold&#x92;s defeat?  This enquiry is dismissed as being &#x93;one step removed from the text of the ads themselves.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 20.  But these questions are central to the meaning of the ads, and any reasonable person would take account of circumstances in coming to understand the object of WRTL&#x92;s ad.  And why not?  Each of the contextual facts here can be established by an objective look at a public record; none requires a voter (or a litigant) to engage in discovery of evidence about WRTL&#x92;s operations or internal communications, and none goes to a hidden state of mind.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This refusal to see and hear what any listener to WRTL&#x92;s ads would actually consider produces a rule no different in practice from the one adopted by the District Court, which declined to look beyond the &#x93;four corners&#x94; of the ads themselves.  466 F. Supp. 2d 195, 207 (DC 2006).  Although <span class="smallcaps">The</span>
            <span class="smallcaps">Chief Justice</span> ostensibly stops short of categorically foreclosing consideration of context, see <em>ante</em>, at 20, the application of his test here makes it difficult to see how relevant contextual evidence could ever be taken into account the way it was in <em>McConnell</em>,<a name="ZD-19ref" href="#ZD-19" class="">

        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Third, it may be that the principal opinion rejects <em>McConnell </em>on the erroneous assumption that &#xA7;203 flatly bans independent electioneering communications by a corporation.  <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span> argues that corporations must receive &#x93;the benefit of any doubt,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16,<em/>whenever we undertake the task of &#x93;separating &#x2026; political speech protected under the

But this is a fundamental misconception of the task at hand:  we have already held that it is &#x93; &#x91;simply wrong&#x92; to view [&#xA7;203] as a &#x91;complete ban&#x92; on expression,&#x94; because PAC financing provides corporations &#x93;with a constitutionally sufficient opportunity to engage in express advocacy.&#x94;<a name="ZD-20ref" href="#ZD-20" class="">

            <em>McConnell</em>, 540 U. S., at 203&#x96;204 (quoting <em>Beaumont</em>, 539 U. S., at 162).  Thus, a successful as-applied challenger to &#xA7;203 should necessarily show, at the least, that it could not constitutionally be subjected to the administrative rules that govern a PAC&#x92;s formation and operation.  See <em>id.</em>, at 163.  This would be an uphill fight, after our repeated affirmations that the PAC structure does not impose excessive burdens, <em>ibid.</em> (citing <em>National Right to Work Comm.</em>, 459 U. S., at 201&#x96;202), and WRTL has a particularly weak position on this point: it set up its own PAC long before the 2004 election, used it to campaign openly against Senator Feingold in the past, and could have raised noncorporate donations to it in the 2004 election cycle.  Any argument that establishing and maintaining a PAC is unconstitutionally burdensome for WRTL would thus likely be futile, and certainly should not prevail on WRTL&#x92;s summary judgment motion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For that matter, even without the PAC alternative, it would be untrue that &#xA7;203 &#x93;banned&#x94; WRTL from saying anything a genuine issue ad would say, for WRTL could have availed itself of either or both of the following additional options.  It is undisputed that WRTL&#x92;s ads could have been broadcast lawfully in the runup to the election (and bankrolled from WRTL&#x92;s general treasury) if Senator Feingold&#x92;s name had been omitted and the Senator not otherwise singled out.  Since members of today&#x92;s majority apparently view WRTL&#x92;s broadcasts either as &#x93;genuine issue ad[s],&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16 (opinion of <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>), or as &#x93;lobby[ing] Wisconsin voters concerning the filibustering of the President&#x92;s judicial nominees,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 2 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.,</span> concurring in part and concurring in judgment), a claim that omitting Senator Feingold&#x92;s name would &#x93;ban&#x94; WRTL&#x92;s message is specious.  Yet one searches my Brothers&#x92; opinions in vain for any persuasive reason why substituting the phrase &#x93;Contact your Senators&#x94; for the phrase &#x93;Contact Senators Feingold and Kohl&#x94; would have denied WRTL a constitutionally sufficient (and clearly lawful) alternative way to send its message.  If WRTL is to be believed when it claims that the issue was the point of the ads, it would have lost nothing by referring simply to the &#x93;Senators.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the suggestion that &#xA7;203 is a ban on political speech is belied by <em>MCFL</em>&#x92;s safe harbor for nonprofit advocacy corporations: under that rule, WRTL would have been free to attack Senator Feingold by name at any time with ads funded from its corporate treasury, if it had not also chosen to serve as a funnel for hundreds of thousands of dollars from other corporations.  Thus, what is called a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech is a limit on the financing of electioneering broadcasts by entities that refuse to take advantage of the PAC structure but insist on acting as conduits from the campaign war chests of business corporations.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, <em>McConnell</em> does not graft a subjective standard onto campaign regulation, the context of campaign advertising cannot sensibly be ignored, and &#xA7;203 is not a ban on speech.  What cannot be gainsaid, in any event, is that in treating these subjects as it does, the operative opinion produces the result of overruling <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s holding on &#xA7;203, less than four years in the Reports.  Anyone who doubts that need merely ask what the law would have been if, back in 2003, this Court had held &#xA7;203 facially unconstitutional.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    BCRA&#x92;s definition of &#x93;electioneering communication,&#x94; which identifies the communications regulable under &#xA7;203, includes a backup to be used if the primary definition &#x93;is held to be constitutionally insufficient by final judicial decision to support the regulation provided herein.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/2/434.html#f_3_A_ii" class="subref" title="subref">2 U. S. C. &#xA7;434(f)(3)(A)(ii)</a> (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  If this should occur, &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94; is to be defined as </p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;any broadcast, cable, or satellite communication which promotes or supports a candidate for that office, or attacks or opposes a candidate for that office (regardless of whether the communication expressly advocates a vote for or against a candidate) and which also is suggestive of no plausible meaning other than an exhortation to vote for or against a specific candidate.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This backup sounds familiar because it is essentially identical to <span class="smallcaps">The Chief Justice</span>&#x92;s test for evaluating an as-applied challenge to the original definition of &#x93;electioneering communication&#x94;: regulation is permissible only if the communication is &#x93;susceptible of no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for or against a specific candidate,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 16.  Thus does the principal opinion institute the very standard that would have prevailed if the Court formally overruled <em>McConnell</em>.  There is neither a theoretical nor a practical basis to claim that <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s treatment of &#xA7;203 survives.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">E</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The price of <em>McConnell&#x92;</em>s<em/>demise as authority on &#xA7;203 seems to me to be a high one.  The Court (and, I think, the country) loses when important precedent is overruled without good reason, and there is no justification for departing from our usual rule of <em>stare decisis</em> here.  The same combination of alternatives that was available to corporations affected by <em>McConnell</em> in 2003 is available today: WRTL could have run a newspaper ad, could have paid for the broadcast ads through its PAC, could have established itself as an <em>MCFL</em> organization free of corporate money, and could have said &#x93;call your Senators&#x94; instead of naming Senator Feingold in its ads broadcasted just before the election.  Nothing in the related law surrounding &#xA7;203 has changed in any way, let alone in any way that undermines <em>McConnell</em>&#x92;s<em/>rationale.

        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, it goes without saying that nothing has changed about the facts.  In Justice Frankfurter&#x92;s words, they demonstrate a threat to &#x93;the integrity of our electoral process,&#x94; <em>Automobile Workers</em>, 352 U. S., at 570, which for a century now Congress has repeatedly found to be imperiled by corporate, and later union, money: witness the Tillman Act, Taft-Hartley, FECA, and BCRA.  See Part II, <em>supra</em>.  <em>McConnell </em>was our latest decision vindicating clear and reasonable boundaries that Congress has drawn to limit &#x93; &#x91;the corrosive and distorting effects of immense aggregations of wealth,&#x92; &#x94; 540 U. S., at 205 (quoting <em>Austin</em>, 494 U. S., at 660), and the decision could claim the justification of ongoing fact as well as decisional history in recognizing Congress&#x92;s authority to protect the integrity of elections from the distortion of corporate and union funds.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After today, the ban on contributions by corporations and unions and the limitation on their corrosive spending when they enter the political arena are open to easy circumvention, and the possibilities for regulating corporate and union campaign money are unclear.  The ban on contributions will mean nothing much, now that companies and unions can save candidates the expense of advertising directly, simply by running &#x93;issue ads&#x94; without express advocacy, or by funneling the money through an independent corporation like WRTL.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But the understanding of the voters and the Congress that this kind of corporate and union spending seriously jeopardizes the integrity of democratic government will remain.  The facts are too powerful to be ignored, and further efforts at campaign finance reform will come.  It is only the legal landscape that now is altered, and it may be that today&#x92;s departure from precedent will drive further reexamination of the constitutional analysis: of the distinction between contributions and expenditures, or the relation between spending and speech, which have given structure to our thinking since <em>Buckley</em> itself was decided.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    I cannot tell what the future will force upon us, but I respectfully dissent from this judgment today.</p>

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> does not protect a nonprofit corporation from expenditure limits if the corporation accepts corporate and union contributions, lest corporations and unions readily &#x93;circumvent&#x94; restrictions on their own election spending &#x93;by funneling money through&#x94; nonprofits).  Justice Scalia asserts that Austin &#x93;strayed far from&#x94; the principles we announced in First Nat. Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/435/765" class="subref" title="subref">435 U. S. 765</a> (1978)
.  Ante, at 7 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Bellotti, however, concerned corporate spending in connection with a referendum, and we went out of our way in that case to avoid casting any doubt upon the constitutionality of limiting corporate expenditures during candidate elections.  We said:


&#x93;The overriding concern behind the enactment of [the federal restrictions on corporate contributions and expenditures] was the problem of corruption of elected representatives through the creation of political debts.  The importance of the governmental interest in preventing this occurrence has never been doubted.  The case before us presents no comparable problem, and our consideration of a corporation&#x92;s right to speak on issues of general public interest implies no comparable right in the quite different context of participation in a political campaign for election to public office.  Congress might well be able to demonstrate the existence of a danger of real or apparent corruption in independent expenditures by corporations to influence candidate elections.&#x94;  435 U. S., at 788, n. 26 (citations omitted).


Eight years before Austin, we unanimously reaffirmed that Bellotti &#x93;specifically pointed out that in elections of candidates to public office, unlike in referenda on issues of general public interest, there may well be a threat of real or apparent corruption.&#x94;  Federal Election Comm&#x92;n v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">7</a> (1982)
.  Then, four years later, in MCFL, we also noted that an expenditure limit offering corporations a PAC alternative is &#x93;distinguishable from the complete foreclosure of any opportunity for political speech&#x94; that we addressed in Bellotti.  479 U. S., at 259, n. 12.  So Austin did not &#x93;stra[y]&#x94; from Bellotti, ante, at 7 (opinion of Scalia, J.); the reasons Bellotti was not controlling in Austin had been clearly foreshadowed in Bellotti itself and confirmed repeatedly in our decisions leading up to Austin.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-10" href="#ZD-10ref">10</a> The Senate Committee was not alone in its concerns.  In Wisconsin, for example, the Governor&#x92;s Blue-Ribbon Commission on Campaign Finance Reform reported:


&#x93;Especially beginning in 1996, issue advocacy during the campaign season dramatically expanded in Wisconsin.
.....


&#x93;The Commission concludes that, in each of these cases, the expenditures were clearly campaign-oriented activities.  They were quite clearly designed to influence the electoral process.  They were focused either on electing or defeating a candidate.  The Commission bases this conclusion on the following points:


&#x93;Although those paying for the activities claimed they were aimed solely at educating voters on the issues, they each mentioned the names of candidates for office.


&#x93;They occurred only when election races were in progress that involved a contest between an incumbent and a challenger.  When the election was over, the activities ended.


&#x93;The activity has occurred after legislative sessions when the issues about which advocacy was occurring were not being deliberated by the legislature.


&#x93;The activity occurred in campaign season, between the candidate&#x92;s filing for candidacy and election time.  Advertisements of this sort have tended to occur at virtually no other time.


&#x93;The activity involved the electronic media, mass mailings, or centrally located telephone banks.
.....


&#x93;The explosive growth of campaign-based advocacy, without even disclosure of its activities and funding sources, poses a grave risk to the integrity of elections. It has created a two-tiered campaign process: one, based in candidates and political parties, which is tightly regulated and controlled; the other, based in interest group activity under the guise of &#x91;issue advocacy&#x92; but actually quite clearly election-focused, which lies beyond accountability.&#x94;  1 Governor&#x92;s Blue-Ribbon Commission on Campaign Finance Reform, State of Wisconsin: Report of the Commission, available at http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-17" href="#ZD-17ref">17</a> The Chief Justice says that Buckley v. Valeo, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/424/1" class="subref" title="subref">424 U. S. 1</a> (1976)
 (per curiam), &#x93;already rejected&#x94; any test that calls for an assessment of the intent and effect of corporate electioneering.  Ante, at 13.  The &#x93;reject[ion]&#x94; to which The Chief Justice presumably refers is Buckley&#x92;s quotation of Thomas v. Collins, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/323/516" class="subref" title="subref">323 U. S. 516</a> (1945)
, where we found impermissibly vague a statute that permitted a union leader to &#x93; &#x91;laud unionism&#x92; &#x94; but forbade him to &#x93;imply an invitation&#x94; to join a union.  Id., at 534.  The problem with this predicament, we reasoned, was the lack of a clearly permissible opportunity for expression:  Whether words &#x93;designed to fall short of invitation would miss that mark is a question both of intent and of effect,&#x94; and no speaker &#x93;safely could assume that anything he might say &#x2026; would not be understood by some as an invitation.&#x94;  Id., at 535.  We then specified that the speaker in Thomas was left with an impermissibly limited universe of &#x93;three choices: (1) to stand on his right and speak freely; (2) to quit, refusing entirely to speak; (3) to trim, and even thus to risk the penalty.&#x94;  Id., at 536.


The Chief Justice implies that considering the intent and effect of corporate advertising during as-applied challenges to &#xA7;203 would put corporations in precisely the same bind; thus, he wonders how McConnell could use the language of intent and effect without &#x93;even address[ing] what Buckley&#x94; (and by extension, Thomas) &#x93;had to say on the subject.&#x94;  Ante, at 14.  But one need not look far in our McConnell opinion to understand why we thought that corporations have more than the constrained set of options available to the union leader in Thomas.  Just a few sentences after holding that ads with electioneering intent and effect are regulable, we gave this explanation: &#x93;in the future corporations and unions may finance genuine issue ads [shortly before an election] by simply avoiding any specific reference to federal candidates, or in doubtful cases by paying for the ad from a segregated fund.&#x94;  540 U. S., at 206.  In other words, corporations can find refuge in constitutionally sufficient and clearly delineated safe harbors by modifying the content of their ads (by omitting a candidate&#x92;s name) or by altering the sources of their ads&#x92; financing (from general treasuries to PACs).  The Chief Justice thus wrongly jettisons our conclusions about the constitutionality of regulating ads with electioneering purpose; we meant what we said in McConnell, and we did not overlook 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> jurisprudence when we said it.  Whereas The Chief Justice says that BCRA &#x93;should provide a safe harbor for those who wish to exercise 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights,&#x94; ante, at 14, we already held in McConnell that the campaign finance law accomplishes precisely that.
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-18" href="#ZD-18ref">18</a> The Chief Justice speculates that McConnell derived its test for functional equivalence from &#x93;[t]wo key studies,&#x94; ante, at 12, but not a shred of language in McConnell supports that theory.  In stating the legal standard, McConnell made no mention of any study.  What is the authority, then, for asserting that the studies were pivotal to the standard we announced in McConnell?  See ante, at 12.  Other than WRTL&#x92;s brief, The Chief Justice cites only Judge Henderson&#x92;s separate district court opinion in McConnell.  Ante, at 12.  But The Chief Justice quotes one part of Judge Henderson&#x92;s analysis and neglects to mention that she in turn was quoting the lead author of one of the studies in question: &#x93;According to the Brennan Center, the Buying Time reports were &#x91;the central piece of evidence marshaled by defenders of&#x92; BCRA&#x92;s electioneering communication provisions &#x91;in support of their constitutional validity.&#x92; &#x94;  McConnell, 251 F. Supp. 2d, at 307&#x96;308 (opinion of Henderson, J.) (italics in original) (quoting deposition of Craig P. Holman, principal co-author of Buying Time 2000: Television Advertising in the 2000 Federal Elections (Brennan Center 2001)).
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-19" href="#ZD-19ref">19</a> Like the District Court, the only bit of context The Chief Justice would allow the reasonable listener is the congressional agenda: whether the &#x93; &#x91;issue&#x92; &#x94; addressed in an ad currently is, or soon will be, &#x93; &#x91;the subject of legislative scrutiny.&#x92; &#x94;  Ante, at 20 (quoting 466 F. Supp. 2d, at 207).  For example, The Chief Justice says, there would have been &#x93;no reason&#x94; to think that WRTL&#x92;s ad constituted anything but a pure issue ad if it addressed a bill pending during Senator Feingold&#x92;s reelection campaign, such as the Universal National Service Act.  Ante, at 17.  It is revealing, of course, that The Chief Justice does not invoke the filibuster issue, the subject of WRTL&#x92;s ads, as the legislative matter with particular salience during the 2004 election.  But why the reasonable listener can look to Congress but not the calendar on the wall or a WRTL website is difficult to fathom.
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-20" href="#ZD-20ref">20</a>Justice Scalia also adopts the same misconception that &#xA7;203 is a &#x93;ban&#x94; on speech.  See ante, at 18 (&#x93;Section 203&#x92;s line is bright, but it bans vast amounts of political advocacy indistinguishable from hitherto protected speech&#x94;).
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-21" href="#ZD-21ref">21</a> These as-applied challenges provide no reason to second-guess our conclusion in McConnell that the rule for differentiating between electioneering ads and genuine issue ads is administrable.  WRTL&#x92;s ads clearly have an electioneering purpose and, as explained above, fall comfortably within the heartland of electioneering communications that &#xA7;203 may validly regulate.  Thus, although Justice Scalia claims that &#x93;[t]oday&#x92;s cases make it apparent&#x94; that McConnell must be overruled, ante, at 18, there is nothing about today&#x92;s cases that suggests that McConnell is unworkable.  We therefore have no occasion to reconsider McConnell from first principles.
