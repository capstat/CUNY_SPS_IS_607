				, at 203.  When a perpetrator flees police in a car, his determination to elude capture makes a lack of concern for the safety of others an inherent part of the offense.  Even if he drives without going full speed or the wrong way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a legitimate and lawful manner, exceed or almost match his speed or use force to bring him within their custody.  His indifference to these collateral consequences has violent&#x97;even lethal&#x97;potential for others.  A fleeing criminal who creates a risk of this dimension takes action similar in degree of danger to that involved in arson, which also entails intentional release of a destructive force dangerous to others.  Also telling is a comparison to burglary, which is dangerous because it can end in confrontation leading to violence.  In fact, the risks associated with vehicle flight may outstrip the dangers of both burglary and arson.  While statistics are not dispositive, studies show that the risk of personal injuries is about 20% lower for each of those enumerated crimes than for vehicle pursuits.  Thus, Indiana&#x92;s prohibition on vehicle flight falls within &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii)&#x92;s residual clause because, as a categorical matter, it presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.

This argument is unconvincing.

This intelligible principle provides guidance, allowing a person to conform his conduct to the law.  While this approach may at times be more difficult for courts to implement, it is within congressional power to enact.  Pp. 13&#x96;14.

				His third prior felony is the one of concern here.  Sykes was convicted for vehicle flight, in violation of Indiana&#x92;s &#x93;resisting law enforcement&#x94; law.  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3.  That law provides:

On appeal Sykes conceded that his two prior robbery con-victions were violent felonies.  He did not dispute that his vehicle flight offense was a felony, but he did argue that it was not violent.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  598 F. 3d 334 (2010).

So while there may be little doubt that the circumstances of the flight in Sykes&#x92; own case were violent, the question is whether &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 of the Indiana Code, as a categorical matter, is a violent felony.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
Resisting law enforcement through felonious vehicle flight does not meet the requirements of clause (i), and it is not among the specific offenses named in clause (ii).  Thus, it is violent under this statutory scheme only if it fits within the so-called residual provision of clause (ii).  To be a vio-lent crime, it must be an offense that &#x93;otherwise in-

The offenses enumerated in &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii)&#x97;burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving use of explosives&#x97;provide guidance in making this determination.  For instance, a crime involves the requisite risk when &#x93;the risk posed by [the crime in question] is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x94;

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				When a perpetrator defies a law enforcement command by fleeing in a car, the determination to elude capture makes a lack of concern for the safety of property and persons of pedestrians and other drivers an inherent part of the offense.  Even if the criminal attempting to elude capture drives without going at full speed or going the wrong way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a legitimate and lawful manner, exceed or almost match his speed or use force to bring him within their custody.  A perpetrator&#x92;s indifference to these collateral consequences has violent&#x97;even lethal&#x97;potential for others.  A criminal who takes flight and creates a risk of this dimension takes action similar in degree of danger to that involved in arson, which also entails intentional release of a destructive force dangerous to others.  This similarity is a beginning point in establishing that vehicle flight presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.

				Another consideration is a comparison to the crime of burglary.  Burglary is dangerous because it can end in confrontation leading to violence.

				, at 200.  The same is true of vehicle flight, but to an even greater degree.  The attempt to elude capture is a direct challenge to an officer&#x92;s authority.  It is a provocative and dangerous act that dares, and in a typical case requires, the officer to give chase.  The felon&#x92;s conduct gives the officer reason to believe that the defendant has something more serious than a traffic violation to hide.  In Sykes&#x92; case, officers pursued a man with two prior violent felony convictions and marijuana in his possession.  In other cases officers may discover more about the violent potential of the fleeing suspect by running a check on the license plate or by recognizing the fugitive as a convicted felon.  See,

, rejected the possibility that police could eliminate the danger from a vehicle flight by giving up the chase because the perpetrator &#x93;might have been just as likely to respond by continuing to drive recklessly as by slowing down and wiping his brow.&#x94;  And once the pursued vehicle is stopped, it is sometimes necessary for officers to approach with guns drawn to effect arrest.  Confrontation with police is the expected result of vehicle flight.  It places property and persons at serious risk of injury.

				Risk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight.  Between the confrontations that initiate and terminate the incident, the intervening pursuit creates high risks of crashes.  It presents more certain risk as a categorical matter than burglary.  It is well known that when offenders use motor vehicles as their means of escape they create serious po-tential risks of physical injury to others.  Flight from a
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				law enforcement officer invites, even demands, pursuit.  As that pursuit continues, the risk of an accident accumulates.  And having chosen to flee, and thereby commit a crime, the perpetrator has all the more reason to seek to avoid capture.

				Unlike burglaries, vehicle flights from an officer by definitional necessity occur when police are present, are flights in defiance of their instructions, and are effected with a vehicle that can be used in a way to cause serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  See

				Sykes argues that, regardless of risk level, typical vehicle flights do not involve the kinds of dangers that the Armed Career Criminal Act&#x92;s (ACCA) residual clause demands.  In his view this Court&#x92;s decisions in 
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				ACCA limits the residual clause to crimes &#x93;typically committed by those whom one normally labels &#x91;armed career criminals,&#x92; &#x94; that is, crimes that &#x93;show an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.&#x94;

				Sykes finds it significant that his flight conviction was not under the Indiana provision that criminalizes flight in which the offender &#x93;operates a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B).  In structuring its laws in this way, Sykes contends, Indiana confirmed that it did not intend subsection (b)(1)(A)&#x92;s general prohibition on vehicle flight to encompass the particular class of vehicle flights that subsection (b)(1)(B) reaches.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Sykes&#x92; argument is unconvincing.  Indiana treats violations of subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) as crimes of the same magnitude.  They are both class D felonies, and both carry terms of between six months and three years, Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;50&#x96;2&#x96;7(a).  The distinction between the provisions is their relationship to subsection (a), which prohibits, among other acts, much conduct in which a person
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				&#x93;(1) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with a law en-forcement officer &#x2026; ; (2) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with the authorized service or execution of &#x2026; process &#x2026; ; or (3) flees from a law enforcement officer.&#x94;  &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a).  Subsection (b)(1)(A) only involves the conduct barred by subsection (a)(3)&#x97;flight&#x97;which, it states, is a felony whenever committed with a vehicle.  Under subsection (b)(1)(B), by contrast, any of the offenses in subsection (a) is a felony if the offender commits it while using a vehicle to create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another.  Taken together, the statutory incentives always favor prosecuting vehicle flights under subsection (b)(1)(A) rather than subsection (b)(1)(B).  They reflect a judgment that some offenses in subsection (a) can be committed without a vehicle or without creating substantial risks.  They reflect the further judgment that this is not so for vehicle flights.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Serious and substantial risks are an inherent part of vehicle flight.  Under subsection (b)(1)(A), they need not be proved separately to secure a conviction equal in magnitude to those available for other forms of resisting law enforcement with a vehicle that involve similar risks.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In other words, the &#x93;similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that [subsection (b)(1)(A)] is the rough equivalent of one type of [subsection (b)(1)(B)] violation.&#x94;

				The Government would go further and deem it irrelevant under the residual clause whether a crime is a lesser included offense even in cases where that offense carries a less severe penalty than the offense that includes it.

				Congress chose to frame ACCA in general and qualitative, rather than encyclopedic, terms.  It could have defined violent felonies by compiling a list of specific covered offenses.  Under the principle that all are deemed to know the law, every armed felon would then be assumed to know which of his prior felonies could serve to increase

				In the instant case a report prepared for Sykes&#x92; federal sentencing describes the details of the Indiana crime.  After observing Sykes driving without using needed headlights, police activated their emergency equipment for a traffic stop.  Sykes did not stop.  A chase ensued.  Sykes wove through traffic, drove on the wrong side of the road and through yards containing bystanders, passed through a fence, and struck the rear of a house.  Then he fled on foot.  He was found only with the aid of a police dog.

				The District Court decided that his three prior convictions, including the one for violating the prohibition on vehicle flight in subsection (b)(1)(A) of the Indiana statute just discussed, were violent felonies for purposes of &#xA7;924(e) and sentenced Sykes to 188 months of imprisonment.  On appeal Sykes conceded that his two prior robbery con-victions were violent felonies.  He did not dispute that his vehicle flight offense was a felony, but he did argue that it was not violent.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  598 F. 3d 334 (2010).

So while there may be little doubt that the circumstances of the flight in Sykes&#x92; own case were violent, the question is whether &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 of the Indiana Code, as a categorical matter, is a violent felony.

Resisting law enforcement through felonious vehicle flight does not meet the requirements of clause (i), and it is not among the specific offenses named in clause (ii).  Thus, it is violent under this statutory scheme only if it fits within the so-called residual provision of clause (ii).  To be a vio-lent crime, it must be an offense that &#x93;otherwise in-

The offenses enumerated in &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii)&#x97;burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving use of explosives&#x97;provide guidance in making this determination.  For instance, a crime involves the requisite risk when &#x93;the risk posed by [the crime in question] is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x94;

				When a perpetrator defies a law enforcement command by fleeing in a car, the determination to elude capture makes a lack of concern for the safety of property and persons of pedestrians and other drivers an inherent part of the offense.  Even if the criminal attempting to elude capture drives without going at full speed or going the wrong way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a legitimate and lawful manner, exceed or almost match his speed or use force to bring him within their custody.  A perpetrator&#x92;s indifference to these collateral consequences has violent&#x97;even lethal&#x97;potential for others.  A criminal who takes flight and creates a risk of this dimension takes action similar in degree of danger to that involved in arson, which also entails intentional release of a destructive force dangerous to others.  This similarity is a beginning point in establishing that vehicle flight presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.

				Another consideration is a comparison to the crime of burglary.  Burglary is dangerous because it can end in confrontation leading to violence.

				, at 200.  The same is true of vehicle flight, but to an even greater degree.  The attempt to elude capture is a direct challenge to an officer&#x92;s authority.  It is a provocative and dangerous act that dares, and in a typical case requires, the officer to give chase.  The felon&#x92;s conduct gives the officer reason to believe that the defendant has something more serious than a traffic violation to hide.  In Sykes&#x92; case, officers pursued a man with two prior violent felony convictions and marijuana in his possession.  In other cases officers may discover more about the violent potential of the fleeing suspect by running a check on the license plate or by recognizing the fugitive as a convicted felon.  See,

, rejected the possibility that police could eliminate the danger from a vehicle flight by giving up the chase because the perpetrator &#x93;might have been just as likely to respond by continuing to drive recklessly as by slowing down and wiping his brow.&#x94;  And once the pursued vehicle is stopped, it is sometimes necessary for officers to approach with guns drawn to effect arrest.  Confrontation with police is the expected result of vehicle flight.  It places property and persons at serious risk of injury.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Risk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight.  Between the confrontations that initiate and terminate the incident, the intervening pursuit creates high risks of crashes.  It presents more certain risk as a categorical matter than burglary.  It is well known that when offenders use motor vehicles as their means of escape they create serious po-tential risks of physical injury to others.  Flight from a
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				law enforcement officer invites, even demands, pursuit.  As that pursuit continues, the risk of an accident accumulates.  And having chosen to flee, and thereby commit a crime, the perpetrator has all the more reason to seek to avoid capture.

				Unlike burglaries, vehicle flights from an officer by definitional necessity occur when police are present, are flights in defiance of their instructions, and are effected with a vehicle that can be used in a way to cause serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  See

				ACCA limits the residual clause to crimes &#x93;typically committed by those whom one normally labels &#x91;armed career criminals,&#x92; &#x94; that is, crimes that &#x93;show an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.&#x94;

				Sykes finds it significant that his flight conviction was not under the Indiana provision that criminalizes flight in which the offender &#x93;operates a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B).  In structuring its laws in this way, Sykes contends, Indiana confirmed that it did not intend subsection (b)(1)(A)&#x92;s general prohibition on vehicle flight to encompass the particular class of vehicle flights that subsection (b)(1)(B) reaches.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Sykes&#x92; argument is unconvincing.  Indiana treats violations of subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) as crimes of the same magnitude.  They are both class D felonies, and both carry terms of between six months and three years, Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;50&#x96;2&#x96;7(a).  The distinction between the provisions is their relationship to subsection (a), which prohibits, among other acts, much conduct in which a person
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				&#x93;(1) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with a law en-forcement officer &#x2026; ; (2) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with the authorized service or execution of &#x2026; process &#x2026; ; or (3) flees from a law enforcement officer.&#x94;  &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a).  Subsection (b)(1)(A) only involves the conduct barred by subsection (a)(3)&#x97;flight&#x97;which, it states, is a felony whenever committed with a vehicle.  Under subsection (b)(1)(B), by contrast, any of the offenses in subsection (a) is a felony if the offender commits it while using a vehicle to create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another.  Taken together, the statutory incentives always favor prosecuting vehicle flights under subsection (b)(1)(A) rather than subsection (b)(1)(B).  They reflect a judgment that some offenses in subsection (a) can be committed without a vehicle or without creating substantial risks.  They reflect the further judgment that this is not so for vehicle flights.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Serious and substantial risks are an inherent part of vehicle flight.  Under subsection (b)(1)(A), they need not be proved separately to secure a conviction equal in magnitude to those available for other forms of resisting law enforcement with a vehicle that involve similar risks.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In other words, the &#x93;similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that [subsection (b)(1)(A)] is the rough equivalent of one type of [subsection (b)(1)(B)] violation.&#x94;

				The Government would go further and deem it irrelevant under the residual clause whether a crime is a lesser included offense even in cases where that offense carries a less severe penalty than the offense that includes it.

After observing Sykes driving without using needed headlights, police activated their emergency equipment for a traffic stop.  Sykes did not stop.  A chase ensued.

				The District Court decided that his three prior convictions, including the one for violating the prohibition on vehicle flight in subsection (b)(1)(A) of the Indiana statute just discussed, were violent felonies for purposes of &#xA7;924(e) and sentenced Sykes to 188 months of imprisonment.  On appeal Sykes conceded that his two prior robbery con-victions were violent felonies.  He did not dispute that his vehicle flight offense was a felony, but he did argue that it was not violent.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  598 F. 3d 334 (2010).

So while there may be little doubt that the circumstances of the flight in Sykes&#x92; own case were violent, the question is whether &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 of the Indiana Code, as a categorical matter, is a violent felony.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Resisting law enforcement through felonious vehicle flight does not meet the requirements of clause (i), and it is not among the specific offenses named in clause (ii).  Thus, it is violent under this statutory scheme only if it fits within the so-called residual provision of clause (ii).  To be a vio-lent crime, it must be an offense that &#x93;otherwise in-

				The question, then, is whether Indiana&#x92;s prohibition on flight from an officer by driving a vehicle&#x97;the violation of Indiana law for which Sykes sustained his earlier conviction&#x97;falls within the residual clause because, as a categorical matter, it presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  The offenses enumerated in &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii)&#x97;burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving use of explosives&#x97;provide guidance in making this determination.  For instance, a crime involves the requisite risk when &#x93;the risk posed by [the crime in question] is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x94;

				, 550 U. S., at 203 (explaining that attempted burglary poses risks akin to that of completed burglary).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				When a perpetrator defies a law enforcement command by fleeing in a car, the determination to elude capture makes a lack of concern for the safety of property and persons of pedestrians and other drivers an inherent part of the offense.  Even if the criminal attempting to elude capture drives without going at full speed or going the wrong way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a legitimate and lawful manner, exceed or almost match his speed or use force to bring him within their custody.  A perpetrator&#x92;s indifference to these collateral consequences has violent&#x97;even lethal&#x97;potential for others.  A criminal who takes flight and creates a risk of this dimension takes action similar in degree of danger to that involved in arson, which also entails intentional release of a destructive force dangerous to others.  This similarity is a beginning point in establishing that vehicle flight presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Another consideration is a comparison to the crime of burglary.  Burglary is dangerous because it can end in confrontation leading to violence.  
				<em>

				, at 200.  The same is true of vehicle flight, but to an even greater degree.  The attempt to elude capture is a direct challenge to an officer&#x92;s authority.  It is a provocative and dangerous act that dares, and in a typical case requires, the officer to give chase.  The felon&#x92;s conduct gives the officer reason to believe that the defendant has something more serious than a traffic violation to hide.  In Sykes&#x92; case, officers pursued a man with two prior violent felony convictions and marijuana in his possession.  In other cases officers may discover more about the violent potential of the fleeing suspect by running a check on the license plate or by recognizing the fugitive as a convicted felon.  See,

, rejected the possibility that police could eliminate the danger from a vehicle flight by giving up the chase because the perpetrator &#x93;might have been just as likely to respond by continuing to drive recklessly as by slowing down and wiping his brow.&#x94;  And once the pursued vehicle is stopped, it is sometimes necessary for officers to approach with guns drawn to effect arrest.  Confrontation with police is the expected result of vehicle flight.  It places property and persons at serious risk of injury.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Risk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight.  Between the confrontations that initiate and terminate the incident, the intervening pursuit creates high risks of crashes.  It presents more certain risk as a categorical matter than burglary.  It is well known that when offenders use motor vehicles as their means of escape they create serious po-tential risks of physical injury to others.  Flight from a
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				law enforcement officer invites, even demands, pursuit.  As that pursuit continues, the risk of an accident accumulates.  And having chosen to flee, and thereby commit a crime, the perpetrator has all the more reason to seek to avoid capture.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Unlike burglaries, vehicle flights from an officer by definitional necessity occur when police are present, are flights in defiance of their instructions, and are effected with a vehicle that can be used in a way to cause serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  See

				Sykes argues that, regardless of risk level, typical vehicle flights do not involve the kinds of dangers that the Armed Career Criminal Act&#x92;s (ACCA) residual clause demands.  In his view this Court&#x92;s decisions in 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				 and 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				 require ACCA predicates to be purposeful, violent, and aggressive in ways that vehicle flight is not.  Sykes, in taking this position, overreads the opinions of this Court.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				ACCA limits the residual clause to crimes &#x93;typically committed by those whom one normally labels &#x91;armed career criminals,&#x92; &#x94; that is, crimes that &#x93;show an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.&#x94;

				The sole decision of this Court concerning the reach of ACCA&#x92;s residual clause in which risk was not the dis-positive factor is 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				, which held that driving under
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				the influence (DUI) is not an ACCA predicate.  There, the Court stated that DUI is not purposeful, violent, and aggressive.  553 U. S., at 145&#x96;148.  But the Court also gave a more specific reason for its holding.  &#x93;[T]he conduct for which the drunk driver is convicted (driving under the influence) need not be purposeful or deliberate,&#x94; 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 145 (analogizing DUI to strict-liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes).  By contrast,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				the Indiana statute at issue here has a stringent 
				<em>
					mens rea
				</em>
				 requirement.  Violators must act &#x93;knowingly or intentionally.&#x94;  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a); see

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The phrase &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; has no precise textual link to the residual clause, which requires that an ACCA predicate &#x93;otherwise involv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  The 
				<em>
					Begay 
				</em>
				phrase is an addition to the statutory text.  In many cases the purposeful, violent, and aggressive inquiry will be redundant with the inquiry into risk, for crimes that fall within the former formulation and those that present serious potential risks of physical injury to others tend to be one and the same.  As between the two inquiries, risk levels provide a categorical and manageable standard that suffices to resolve the case before us.

				involved a crime akin to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes; and the purposeful, violent, and aggressive formulation was used in that case to explain the result.  The felony at issue here is not a strict liability, negligence, or recklessness crime and because it is, for the reasons stated and as a categorical matter, similar in risk to the listed crimes, it is a crime that &#x93;otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii).

				Sykes finds it significant that his flight conviction was not under the Indiana provision that criminalizes flight in which the offender &#x93;operates a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B).  In structuring its laws in this way, Sykes contends, Indiana confirmed that it did not intend subsection (b)(1)(A)&#x92;s general prohibition on vehicle flight to encompass the particular class of vehicle flights that subsection (b)(1)(B) reaches.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Sykes&#x92; argument is unconvincing.  Indiana treats violations of subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) as crimes of the same magnitude.  They are both class D felonies, and both carry terms of between six months and three years, Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;50&#x96;2&#x96;7(a).  The distinction between the provisions is their relationship to subsection (a), which prohibits, among other acts, much conduct in which a person
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				&#x93;(1) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with a law en-forcement officer &#x2026; ; (2) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with the authorized service or execution of &#x2026; process &#x2026; ; or (3) flees from a law enforcement officer.&#x94;  &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a).  Subsection (b)(1)(A) only involves the conduct barred by subsection (a)(3)&#x97;flight&#x97;which, it states, is a felony whenever committed with a vehicle.  Under subsection (b)(1)(B), by contrast, any of the offenses in subsection (a) is a felony if the offender commits it while using a vehicle to create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another.  Taken together, the statutory incentives always favor prosecuting vehicle flights under subsection (b)(1)(A) rather than subsection (b)(1)(B).  They reflect a judgment that some offenses in subsection (a) can be committed without a vehicle or without creating substantial risks.  They reflect the further judgment that this is not so for vehicle flights.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Serious and substantial risks are an inherent part of vehicle flight.  Under subsection (b)(1)(A), they need not be proved separately to secure a conviction equal in magnitude to those available for other forms of resisting law enforcement with a vehicle that involve similar risks.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In other words, the &#x93;similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that [subsection (b)(1)(A)] is the rough equivalent of one type of [subsection (b)(1)(B)] violation.&#x94;

				The Government would go further and deem it irrelevant under the residual clause whether a crime is a lesser included offense even in cases where that offense carries a less severe penalty than the offense that includes it.  As the above discussion indicates, however, the case at hand does not present the occasion to decide that question.

				Congress chose to frame ACCA in general and qualitative, rather than encyclopedic, terms.  It could have defined violent felonies by compiling a list of specific covered offenses.  Under the principle that all are deemed to know the law, every armed felon would then be assumed to know which of his prior felonies could serve to increase
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				his sentence.  Given that ACCA &#x93;requires judges to make sometimes difficult evaluations of the risks posed by different offenses,&#x94; this approach could simplify adjudications for judges in some cases.

				The District Court decided that his three prior convictions, including the one for violating the prohibition on vehicle flight in subsection (b)(1)(A) of the Indiana statute just discussed, were violent felonies for purposes of &#xA7;924(e) and sentenced Sykes to 188 months of imprisonment.  On appeal Sykes conceded that his two prior robbery con-victions were violent felonies.  He did not dispute that his vehicle flight offense was a felony, but he did argue that it was not violent.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  598 F. 3d 334 (2010).

So while there may be little doubt that the circumstances of the flight in Sykes&#x92; own case were violent, the question is whether &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 of the Indiana Code, as a categorical matter, is a violent felony.

Resisting law enforcement through felonious vehicle flight does not meet the requirements of clause (i), and it is not among the specific offenses named in clause (ii).

The offenses enumerated in &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii)&#x97;burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving use of explosives&#x97;provide guidance in making this determination.  For instance, a crime involves the requisite risk when &#x93;the risk posed by [the crime in question] is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x94;

				When a perpetrator defies a law enforcement command by fleeing in a car, the determination to elude capture makes a lack of concern for the safety of property and persons of pedestrians and other drivers an inherent part of the offense.  Even if the criminal attempting to elude capture drives without going at full speed or going the wrong way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a legitimate and lawful manner, exceed or almost match his speed or use force to bring him within their custody.  A perpetrator&#x92;s indifference to these collateral consequences has violent&#x97;even lethal&#x97;potential for others.  A criminal who takes flight and creates a risk of this dimension takes action similar in degree of danger to that involved in arson, which also entails intentional release of a destructive force dangerous to others.  This similarity is a beginning point in establishing that vehicle flight presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.

				, at 200.  The same is true of vehicle flight, but to an even greater degree.  The attempt to elude capture is a direct challenge to an officer&#x92;s authority.  It is a provocative and dangerous act that dares, and in a typical case requires, the officer to give chase.  The felon&#x92;s conduct gives the officer reason to believe that the defendant has something more serious than a traffic violation to hide.  In Sykes&#x92; case, officers pursued a man with two prior violent felony convictions and marijuana in his possession.  In other cases officers may discover more about the violent potential of the fleeing suspect by running a check on the license plate or by recognizing the fugitive as a convicted felon.  See,

, rejected the possibility that police could eliminate the danger from a vehicle flight by giving up the chase because the perpetrator &#x93;might have been just as likely to respond by continuing to drive recklessly as by slowing down and wiping his brow.&#x94;  And once the pursued vehicle is stopped, it is sometimes necessary for officers to approach with guns drawn to effect arrest.  Confrontation with police is the expected result of vehicle flight.  It places property and persons at serious risk of injury.

				Risk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight.  Between the confrontations that initiate and terminate the incident, the intervening pursuit creates high risks of crashes.  It presents more certain risk as a categorical matter than burglary.  It is well known that when offenders use motor vehicles as their means of escape they create serious po-tential risks of physical injury to others.  Flight from a
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				law enforcement officer invites, even demands, pursuit.  As that pursuit continues, the risk of an accident accumulates.  And having chosen to flee, and thereby commit a crime, the perpetrator has all the more reason to seek to avoid capture.

				Unlike burglaries, vehicle flights from an officer by definitional necessity occur when police are present, are flights in defiance of their instructions, and are effected with a vehicle that can be used in a way to cause serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  See

				Sykes finds it significant that his flight conviction was not under the Indiana provision that criminalizes flight in which the offender &#x93;operates a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B).  In structuring its laws in this way, Sykes contends, Indiana confirmed that it did not intend subsection (b)(1)(A)&#x92;s general prohibition on vehicle flight to encompass the particular class of vehicle flights that subsection (b)(1)(B) reaches.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Sykes&#x92; argument is unconvincing.  Indiana treats violations of subsections (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) as crimes of the same magnitude.  They are both class D felonies, and both carry terms of between six months and three years, Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;50&#x96;2&#x96;7(a).  The distinction between the provisions is their relationship to subsection (a), which prohibits, among other acts, much conduct in which a person
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				&#x93;(1) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with a law en-forcement officer &#x2026; ; (2) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with the authorized service or execution of &#x2026; process &#x2026; ; or (3) flees from a law enforcement officer.&#x94;  &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a).  Subsection (b)(1)(A) only involves the conduct barred by subsection (a)(3)&#x97;flight&#x97;which, it states, is a felony whenever committed with a vehicle.  Under subsection (b)(1)(B), by contrast, any of the offenses in subsection (a) is a felony if the offender commits it while using a vehicle to create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another.  Taken together, the statutory incentives always favor prosecuting vehicle flights under subsection (b)(1)(A) rather than subsection (b)(1)(B).  They reflect a judgment that some offenses in subsection (a) can be committed without a vehicle or without creating substantial risks.  They reflect the further judgment that this is not so for vehicle flights.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Serious and substantial risks are an inherent part of vehicle flight.  Under subsection (b)(1)(A), they need not be proved separately to secure a conviction equal in magnitude to those available for other forms of resisting law enforcement with a vehicle that involve similar risks.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In other words, the &#x93;similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that [subsection (b)(1)(A)] is the rough equivalent of one type of [subsection (b)(1)(B)] violation.&#x94;

				The Government would go further and deem it irrelevant under the residual clause whether a crime is a lesser included offense even in cases where that offense carries a less severe penalty than the offense that includes it.

				Congress chose to frame ACCA in general and qualitative, rather than encyclopedic, terms.  It could have defined violent felonies by compiling a list of specific covered offenses.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/922.html#g_1" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. &#xA7;922(g)(1)</a>, in connection with an attempted robbery of two people at gunpoint.  Sykes had previous convictions for at least three felonies.

				Here, as will be further explained, Sykes used a vehicle to flee after an officer ordered him to stop, which was, as the statute provides, a class D felony.

				In the instant case a report prepared for Sykes&#x92; federal sentencing describes the details of the Indiana crime.  After observing Sykes driving without using needed headlights, police activated their emergency equipment for a traffic stop.  Sykes did not stop.  A chase ensued.  Sykes wove through traffic, drove on the wrong side of the road and through yards containing bystanders, passed through a fence, and struck the rear of a house.  Then he fled on foot.  He was found only with the aid of a police dog.

				The District Court decided that his three prior convictions, including the one for violating the prohibition on vehicle flight in subsection (b)(1)(A) of the Indiana statute just discussed, were violent felonies for purposes of &#xA7;924(e) and sentenced Sykes to 188 months of imprisonment.  On appeal Sykes conceded that his two prior robbery con-victions were violent felonies.  He did not dispute that his vehicle flight offense was a felony, but he did argue that it was not violent.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.  598 F. 3d 334 (2010).  The court&#x92;s opinion was consistent with the rulings of the Courts of Appeals in the First, Fifth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits.

So while there may be little doubt that the circumstances of the flight in Sykes&#x92; own case were violent, the question is whether &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 of the Indiana Code, as a categorical matter, is a violent felony.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
Resisting law enforcement through felonious vehicle flight does not meet the requirements of clause (i), and it is not among the specific offenses named in clause (ii).  Thus, it is violent under this statutory scheme only if it fits within the so-called residual provision of clause (ii).  To be a vio-lent crime, it must be an offense that &#x93;otherwise in-

				The question, then, is whether Indiana&#x92;s prohibition on flight from an officer by driving a vehicle&#x97;the violation of Indiana law for which Sykes sustained his earlier conviction&#x97;falls within the residual clause because, as a categorical matter, it presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  The offenses enumerated in &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii)&#x97;burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving use of explosives&#x97;provide guidance in making this determination.  For instance, a crime involves the requisite risk when &#x93;the risk posed by [the crime in question] is comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x94;

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				When a perpetrator defies a law enforcement command by fleeing in a car, the determination to elude capture makes a lack of concern for the safety of property and persons of pedestrians and other drivers an inherent part of the offense.  Even if the criminal attempting to elude capture drives without going at full speed or going the wrong way, he creates the possibility that police will, in a legitimate and lawful manner, exceed or almost match his speed or use force to bring him within their custody.  A perpetrator&#x92;s indifference to these collateral consequences has violent&#x97;even lethal&#x97;potential for others.  A criminal who takes flight and creates a risk of this dimension takes action similar in degree of danger to that involved in arson, which also entails intentional release of a destructive force dangerous to others.  This similarity is a beginning point in establishing that vehicle flight presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.

				Another consideration is a comparison to the crime of burglary.  Burglary is dangerous because it can end in confrontation leading to violence.

				, at 200.  The same is true of vehicle flight, but to an even greater degree.  The attempt to elude capture is a direct challenge to an officer&#x92;s authority.  It is a provocative and dangerous act that dares, and in a typical case requires, the officer to give chase.  The felon&#x92;s conduct gives the officer reason to believe that the defendant has something more serious than a traffic violation to hide.  In Sykes&#x92; case, officers pursued a man with two prior violent felony convictions and marijuana in his possession.  In other cases officers may discover more about the violent potential of the fleeing suspect by running a check on the license plate or by recognizing the fugitive as a convicted felon.  See,

, rejected the possibility that police could eliminate the danger from a vehicle flight by giving up the chase because the perpetrator &#x93;might have been just as likely to respond by continuing to drive recklessly as by slowing down and wiping his brow.&#x94;  And once the pursued vehicle is stopped, it is sometimes necessary for officers to approach with guns drawn to effect arrest.  Confrontation with police is the expected result of vehicle flight.  It places property and persons at serious risk of injury.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Risk of violence is inherent to vehicle flight.  Between the confrontations that initiate and terminate the incident, the intervening pursuit creates high risks of crashes.  It presents more certain risk as a categorical matter than burglary.  It is well known that when offenders use motor vehicles as their means of escape they create serious po-tential risks of physical injury to others.  Flight from a
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				law enforcement officer invites, even demands, pursuit.  As that pursuit continues, the risk of an accident accumulates.  And having chosen to flee, and thereby commit a crime, the perpetrator has all the more reason to seek to avoid capture.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Unlike burglaries, vehicle flights from an officer by definitional necessity occur when police are present, are flights in defiance of their instructions, and are effected with a vehicle that can be used in a way to cause serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  See

				ACCA limits the residual clause to crimes &#x93;typically committed by those whom one normally labels &#x91;armed career criminals,&#x92; &#x94; that is, crimes that &#x93;show an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.&#x94;

Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B).

The distinction between the provisions is their relationship to subsection (a), which prohibits, among other acts, much conduct in which a person
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				&#x93;(1) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with a law en-forcement officer &#x2026; ; (2) forcibly resists, obstructs, or interferes with the authorized service or execution of &#x2026; process &#x2026; ; or (3) flees from a law enforcement officer.&#x94;  &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a).  Subsection (b)(1)(A) only involves the conduct barred by subsection (a)(3)&#x97;flight&#x97;which, it states, is a felony whenever committed with a vehicle.  Under subsection (b)(1)(B), by contrast, any of the offenses in subsection (a) is a felony if the offender commits it while using a vehicle to create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another.  Taken together, the statutory incentives always favor prosecuting vehicle flights under subsection (b)(1)(A) rather than subsection (b)(1)(B).  They reflect a judgment that some offenses in subsection (a) can be committed without a vehicle or without creating substantial risks.  They reflect the further judgment that this is not so for vehicle flights.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Serious and substantial risks are an inherent part of vehicle flight.  Under subsection (b)(1)(A), they need not be proved separately to secure a conviction equal in magnitude to those available for other forms of resisting law enforcement with a vehicle that involve similar risks.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In other words, the &#x93;similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that [subsection (b)(1)(A)] is the rough equivalent of one type of [subsection (b)(1)(B)] violation.&#x94;

				The Government would go further and deem it irrelevant under the residual clause whether a crime is a lesser included offense even in cases where that offense carries a less severe penalty than the offense that includes it.

				Congress chose to frame ACCA in general and qualitative, rather than encyclopedic, terms.  It could have defined violent felonies by compiling a list of specific covered offenses.  Under the principle that all are deemed to know the law, every armed felon would then be assumed to know which of his prior felonies could serve to increase

				Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a felony.  Any person who &#x93;knowingly or intentionally &#x2026; flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered the person to stop&#x94; commits a misdemeanor.  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a)(3).  If the person &#x93;uses a vehicle&#x94; to flee, however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a &#x93;violent felony&#x94; under ACCA if it is &#x93;burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars generally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward avoiding detection.

				In sum, every violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in front of a police officer.  Based on its elements, the potential risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles &#x93;armed burglary in the presence of a security guard&#x94; more than simple burglary.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with much more risk&#x97;a far greater likelihood of confrontation with police and a greater chance of violence in that
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				confrontation&#x97;than burglary.  It follows that the &#x93;the con-duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi-nary case,&#x94; poses a greater risk of harm than the enumerated offense of burglary.

				Sykes argues that intentional vehicular flight is not a violent felony for two main reasons.  First, he asserts that it is possible to violate Indiana&#x92;s intentional vehicular flight statute without doing anything dangerous.  Second, he urges that the existence of Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B), which includes &#x93;substantial risk&#x94; as an additional element, indicates that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.  Neither argument is persuasive.

The argument is that, even though the elements of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the presence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) casts &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous light.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, apart from the existence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), the absence of risk as an element of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) does not mean that the offense is not a violent felony.  ACCA does not require that a violent felony expressly include a risk of injury as an element of the offense.  Enumerated violent felonies like arson and burglary have no such element.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Both are class D felonies, and at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction, there was no statutory difference in punishment between them.  Even now, the offenses remain of a single class, meriting similar punishments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equivalent of one type of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) violation.  Section 3(b)(1)(B) enhances punishments for three separate types of in-tentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, &#xA7;3(a)(1); interfering with service of process, &#xA7;3(a)(2); and fleeing from a police officer, &#xA7;3(a)(3).  Under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), committing any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly weapon, inflicting injury, or &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; has long been a class D felony.

				In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to provide that 
				<em>
					any 
				</em>
				use of a vehicle to flee from an officer under &#xA7;3(a)(3) is 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 a class D felony.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment for one particular violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).

				  It is still the case that under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an officer or interfere with service of process is a class D felony only if the vehicle is &#x93;operate[d] &#x2026; in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  But using a vehicle to intentionally flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove risk.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).

				This rough equivalence between &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) and &#xA7;3(b)

				Third, the remainder of Indiana&#x92;s resisting law enforcement statute confirms that its other provisions do not reserve &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct.  An intentional vehicular flight becomes a class C felony if the vehicle is operated &#x93;in a manner that causes serious bodily injury.&#x94;  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(2).

				  Rather, each provision addresses what happens when the risk inherent

				 was apparently clear enough to spur the Indiana Legislature to specify greater penalties for the inevitable occasions when physical injury actually occurs.  By comparison, for obviously nonrisky felonies like insurance fraud or misappropriation of escrow funds, legislatures do not specify what additional punishment is warranted when the crime kills or injures bystanders or police.  See,

						 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.  His &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road, weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house.  Ante, at 4; 2 App. 11 (Sealed).

						 Indiana law at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction presented two related provisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment.  One was a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a narrower provision that did not.  While Justice Kagan would infer that the offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky, post, at 6&#x96;8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.


Consider reckless endangerment statutes.  In Hawaii, for instance, it is &#x93;reckless endangering in the second degree&#x94; either to &#x93;recklessly plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,&#x94; Haw. Rev. Stat. &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to &#x93;[i]ntentionally discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,&#x94; &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(b).  I would infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given case.  Other States have similar statutes.  See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, &#xA7;&#xA7;603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#xA7;&#xA7;6&#x96;2&#x96;504(a), (b) (2009); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17&#x96;A, &#xA7;&#xA7;301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).


Similarly here, I infer that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A)&#x92;s upgrade of intentional flight to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the offense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).


Justice Kagan argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) when it added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Post, at 12.  There are at least two problems with this reasoning.  First, even though &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) may be redundant with &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in subsection (a)(3), the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).  Thus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  Second, although Justice Kagan can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require perfection in statutory drafting.  See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).  I think it clear enough what the statute means.

				Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a felony.  Any person who &#x93;knowingly or intentionally &#x2026; flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered the person to stop&#x94; commits a misdemeanor.  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a)(3).  If the person &#x93;uses a vehicle&#x94; to flee, however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a &#x93;violent felony&#x94; under ACCA if it is &#x93;burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars generally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward avoiding detection.  Nevertheless, that small chance sufficed for Congress to list burglary as a &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; and for this Court to hold that attempted burglary also qualifies.  See

				Compared to burglary, the elements of intentional vehicular flight describe conduct that ordinarily poses greater potential risk.  Although interruption and confrontation are quite rare for burglary, 
				<em>
					every
				</em>
				 &#xA7;3(a)(3) flight is committed in the presence of a police officer.  
				<em>

				&#xA7;3(a)(3) flight also involves a perpetrator acting in knowing defiance

				In sum, every violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in front of a police officer.  Based on its elements, the potential risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles &#x93;armed burglary in the presence of a security guard&#x94; more than simple burglary.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with much more risk&#x97;a far greater likelihood of confrontation with police and a greater chance of violence in that
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				confrontation&#x97;than burglary.  It follows that the &#x93;the con-duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi-nary case,&#x94; poses a greater risk of harm than the enumerated offense of burglary.

 (statistical evidence, though not always necessary, &#x93;strongly supports the intuitive belief that failure to report does not involve a serious potential risk of physical injury&#x94;).  Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that approximately 100 police officers, pedestrians, and occupants of other cars are killed each year in chase-related crashes.  National Center for Statistics &amp; Analysis, Fatalities in Motor Vehicle Traffic Crashes Involving Police in Pursuit 37&#x96;56 (2010) (reporting 1,269 such deaths between 2000 and 2009).

				The number injured must be much higher.  Many thousands of police chases occur every year.  In California and Pennsylvania, which collect statewide pursuit data, police were involved in a combined total of more than 8,700 chases in 2007 alone.

And up to 41% of all chases involve a crash, which always carries some risk of injury.

Police Strategies &amp; Management 729, 740 (1997) (citing nine studies, each showing a crash rate between 18% and 41%).  Indeed, studies show that 4% to 17% of all chases actually cause injury.

				Sykes argues that intentional vehicular flight is not a violent felony for two main reasons.  First, he asserts that it is possible to violate Indiana&#x92;s intentional vehicular flight statute without doing anything dangerous.  Second, he urges that the existence of Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B), which includes &#x93;substantial risk&#x94; as an additional element, indicates that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.  Neither argument is persuasive.

				The fact that Sykes can imagine a nonrisky way to violate &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) does not disprove that intentional vehicular flight is dangerous &#x93;in the ordinary case.&#x94;  See 
				<em>
					James

				Nor has Sykes established that the nonrisky scenario he imagines is the ordinary violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Sykes offers nothing more than two Indiana cases that, in his view, are instances of nonrisky vehicular flight.  See 
				<em>
					Swain

				 at 898.  Yet not even those cases obviously involve nonrisky conduct.  In 
				<em>
					Swain

				, the defendant was a getaway driver who picked up her boyfriend&#x92;s accomplice as he ran on foot from two police officers.  2010 WL 623720, *1, *3.  As the officers approached the car and shouted to stop, she yelled, &#x93; &#x91;Hurry up.  Come on.  They&#x92;re coming,&#x92; &#x94; and drove off as the runner jumped in.  
				<em>

				<em>
					Ibid.

				  In

					Woodward

				, the defendant ignored a police siren for approximately a mile, passed several good places to pull over, and drove all the way home, but traveled at the speed limit of 45 mph and obeyed traffic laws.  770 N.

From this, Sykes infers that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) necessarily concerns only flight that does not present a serious potential risk.  The argument is that, even though the elements of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the presence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) casts &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous light.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				as an element does not restrict &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to nonrisky

				conduct.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, apart from the existence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), the absence of risk as an element of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) does not mean that the offense is not a violent felony.  ACCA does not require that a violent felony expressly include a risk of injury as an element of the offense.  Enumerated violent felonies like arson and burglary have no such element.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Both are class D felonies, and at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction, there was no statutory difference in punishment between them.  Even now, the offenses remain of a single class, meriting similar punishments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equivalent of one type of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) violation.  Section 3(b)(1)(B) enhances punishments for three separate types of in-tentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, &#xA7;3(a)(1); interfering with service of process, &#xA7;3(a)(2); and fleeing from a police officer, &#xA7;3(a)(3).  Under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), committing any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly weapon, inflicting injury, or &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; has long been a class D felony.

				In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to provide that 
				<em>
					any 
				</em>
				use of a vehicle to flee from an officer under &#xA7;3(a)(3) is 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 a class D felony.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment for one particular violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).

				  It is still the case that under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an officer or interfere with service of process is a class D felony only if the vehicle is &#x93;operate[d] &#x2026; in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  But using a vehicle to intentionally flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove risk.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).

				This rough equivalence between &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) and &#xA7;3(b)

				<span class="softbreak"/>

				Third, the remainder of Indiana&#x92;s resisting law enforcement statute confirms that its other provisions do not reserve &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct.

				 was apparently clear enough to spur the Indiana Legislature to specify greater penalties for the inevitable occasions when physical injury actually occurs.  By comparison, for obviously nonrisky felonies like insurance fraud or misappropriation of escrow funds, legislatures do not specify what additional punishment is warranted when the crime kills or injures bystanders or police.

				Looking to the elements, statistics, common experience, and cases, I conclude that in the ordinary case, Indiana&#x92;s crime of intentional vehicular flight, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A), &#x93;involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

						 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.  His &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road, weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house.  Ante, at 4; 2 App. 11 (Sealed).

						 Indiana law at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction presented two related provisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment.  One was a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a narrower provision that did not.  While Justice Kagan would infer that the offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky, post, at 6&#x96;8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.


Consider reckless endangerment statutes.  In Hawaii, for instance, it is &#x93;reckless endangering in the second degree&#x94; either to &#x93;recklessly plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,&#x94; Haw. Rev. Stat. &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to &#x93;[i]ntentionally discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,&#x94; &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(b).  I would infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given case.  Other States have similar statutes.  See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, &#xA7;&#xA7;603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#xA7;&#xA7;6&#x96;2&#x96;504(a), (b) (2009); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17&#x96;A, &#xA7;&#xA7;301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).


Similarly here, I infer that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A)&#x92;s upgrade of intentional flight to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the offense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).


Justice Kagan argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) when it added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Post, at 12.  There are at least two problems with this reasoning.  First, even though &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) may be redundant with &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in subsection (a)(3), the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).  Thus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  Second, although Justice Kagan can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require perfection in statutory drafting.  See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).  I think it clear enough what the statute means.

						 For that matter, each provision also could be satisfied by a flight that did not satisfy &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), which casts further doubt on Justice Kagan&#x92;s vision of the statutory scheme as a unified structure of neatly progressing offenses with corresponding risk levels and punishments.  See post, at 7.

				Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a felony.  Any person who &#x93;knowingly or intentionally &#x2026; flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered the person to stop&#x94; commits a misdemeanor.  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a)(3).  If the person &#x93;uses a vehicle&#x94; to flee, however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a &#x93;violent felony&#x94; under ACCA if it is &#x93;burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars generally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward avoiding detection.

				In sum, every violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in front of a police officer.  Based on its elements, the potential risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles &#x93;armed burglary in the presence of a security guard&#x94; more than simple burglary.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with much more risk&#x97;a far greater likelihood of confrontation with police and a greater chance of violence in that
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				confrontation&#x97;than burglary.  It follows that the &#x93;the con-duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi-nary case,&#x94; poses a greater risk of harm than the enumerated offense of burglary.

				Sykes argues that intentional vehicular flight is not a violent felony for two main reasons.  First, he asserts that it is possible to violate Indiana&#x92;s intentional vehicular flight statute without doing anything dangerous.  Second, he urges that the existence of Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B), which includes &#x93;substantial risk&#x94; as an additional element, indicates that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.  Neither argument is persuasive.

The argument is that, even though the elements of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the presence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) casts &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous light.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, apart from the existence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), the absence of risk as an element of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) does not mean that the offense is not a violent felony.  ACCA does not require that a violent felony expressly include a risk of injury as an element of the offense.  Enumerated violent felonies like arson and burglary have no such element.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Both are class D felonies, and at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction, there was no statutory difference in punishment between them.  Even now, the offenses remain of a single class, meriting similar punishments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equivalent of one type of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) violation.  Section 3(b)(1)(B) enhances punishments for three separate types of in-tentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, &#xA7;3(a)(1); interfering with service of process, &#xA7;3(a)(2); and fleeing from a police officer, &#xA7;3(a)(3).  Under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), committing any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly weapon, inflicting injury, or &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; has long been a class D felony.

				In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to provide that 
				<em>
					any 
				</em>
				use of a vehicle to flee from an officer under &#xA7;3(a)(3) is 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 a class D felony.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment for one particular violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).

				  It is still the case that under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an officer or interfere with service of process is a class D felony only if the vehicle is &#x93;operate[d] &#x2026; in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  But using a vehicle to intentionally flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove risk.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).

				This rough equivalence between &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) and &#xA7;3(b)

				Third, the remainder of Indiana&#x92;s resisting law enforcement statute confirms that its other provisions do not reserve &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct.  An intentional vehicular flight becomes a class C felony if the vehicle is operated &#x93;in a manner that causes serious bodily injury.&#x94;  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(2).

				  Rather, each provision addresses what happens when the risk inherent

				 was apparently clear enough to spur the Indiana Legislature to specify greater penalties for the inevitable occasions when physical injury actually occurs.  By comparison, for obviously nonrisky felonies like insurance fraud or misappropriation of escrow funds, legislatures do not specify what additional punishment is warranted when the crime kills or injures bystanders or police.  See,

						 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.  His &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road, weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house.  Ante, at 4; 2 App. 11 (Sealed).

						 Indiana law at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction presented two related provisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment.  One was a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a narrower provision that did not.  While Justice Kagan would infer that the offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky, post, at 6&#x96;8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.


Consider reckless endangerment statutes.  In Hawaii, for instance, it is &#x93;reckless endangering in the second degree&#x94; either to &#x93;recklessly plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,&#x94; Haw. Rev. Stat. &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to &#x93;[i]ntentionally discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,&#x94; &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(b).  I would infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given case.  Other States have similar statutes.  See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, &#xA7;&#xA7;603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#xA7;&#xA7;6&#x96;2&#x96;504(a), (b) (2009); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17&#x96;A, &#xA7;&#xA7;301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).


Similarly here, I infer that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A)&#x92;s upgrade of intentional flight to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the offense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).


Justice Kagan argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) when it added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Post, at 12.  There are at least two problems with this reasoning.  First, even though &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) may be redundant with &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in subsection (a)(3), the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).  Thus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  Second, although Justice Kagan can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require perfection in statutory drafting.  See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).  I think it clear enough what the statute means.

				Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a felony.  Any person who &#x93;knowingly or intentionally &#x2026; flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered the person to stop&#x94; commits a misdemeanor.  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a)(3).  If the person &#x93;uses a vehicle&#x94; to flee, however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a &#x93;violent felony&#x94; under ACCA if it is &#x93;burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars generally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward avoiding detection.

				Compared to burglary, the elements of intentional vehicular flight describe conduct that ordinarily poses greater potential risk.  Although interruption and confrontation are quite rare for burglary, 
				<em>
					every

				 &#xA7;3(a)(3) flight is committed in the presence of a police officer.  
				<em>

				&#xA7;3(a)(3) flight also involves a perpetrator acting in knowing defiance

				In sum, every violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in front of a police officer.  Based on its elements, the potential risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles &#x93;armed burglary in the presence of a security guard&#x94; more than simple burglary.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with much more risk&#x97;a far greater likelihood of confrontation with police and a greater chance of violence in that
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				confrontation&#x97;than burglary.  It follows that the &#x93;the con-duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi-nary case,&#x94; poses a greater risk of harm than the enumerated offense of burglary.

Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that approximately 100 police officers, pedestrians, and occupants of other cars are killed each year in chase-related crashes.

				Sykes argues that intentional vehicular flight is not a violent felony for two main reasons.  First, he asserts that it is possible to violate Indiana&#x92;s intentional vehicular flight statute without doing anything dangerous.  Second, he urges that the existence of Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B), which includes &#x93;substantial risk&#x94; as an additional element, indicates that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.  Neither argument is persuasive.

				The fact that Sykes can imagine a nonrisky way to violate &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) does not disprove that intentional vehicular flight is dangerous &#x93;in the ordinary case.&#x94;  See 
				<em>

				Nor has Sykes established that the nonrisky scenario he imagines is the ordinary violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Sykes offers nothing more than two Indiana cases that, in his view, are instances of nonrisky vehicular flight.  See 
				<em>
					Swain

				, the defendant was a getaway driver who picked up her boyfriend&#x92;s accomplice as he ran on foot from two police officers.  2010 WL 623720, *1, *3.  As the officers approached the car and shouted to stop, she yelled, &#x93; &#x91;Hurry up.  Come on.  They&#x92;re coming,&#x92; &#x94; and drove off as the runner jumped in.

				<em>
					Ibid.

From this, Sykes infers that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) necessarily concerns only flight that does not present a serious potential risk.  The argument is that, even though the elements of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the presence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) casts &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous light.

				conduct.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, apart from the existence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), the absence of risk as an element of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) does not mean that the offense is not a violent felony.  ACCA does not require that a violent felony expressly include a risk of injury as an element of the offense.  Enumerated violent felonies like arson and burglary have no such element.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Both are class D felonies, and at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction, there was no statutory difference in punishment between them.  Even now, the offenses remain of a single class, meriting similar punishments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equivalent of one type of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) violation.  Section 3(b)(1)(B) enhances punishments for three separate types of in-tentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, &#xA7;3(a)(1); interfering with service of process, &#xA7;3(a)(2); and fleeing from a police officer, &#xA7;3(a)(3).  Under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), committing any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly weapon, inflicting injury, or &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; has long been a class D felony.

				In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to provide that 
				<em>
					any 
				</em>
				use of a vehicle to flee from an officer under &#xA7;3(a)(3) is 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 a class D felony.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment for one particular violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).

				  It is still the case that under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an officer or interfere with service of process is a class D felony only if the vehicle is &#x93;operate[d] &#x2026; in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  But using a vehicle to intentionally flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove risk.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).

				This rough equivalence between &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) and &#xA7;3(b)

				<span class="softbreak"/>

				Third, the remainder of Indiana&#x92;s resisting law enforcement statute confirms that its other provisions do not reserve &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct.

				  Rather, each provision addresses what happens when the risk inherent
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				in a violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is actualized and someone is hurt or killed.  The risk of physical injury inherent in intentional vehicular flight 
				<em>
					simpliciter
				</em>
				 was apparently clear enough to spur the Indiana Legislature to specify greater penalties for the inevitable occasions when physical injury actually occurs.  By comparison, for obviously nonrisky felonies like insurance fraud or misappropriation of escrow funds, legislatures do not specify what additional punishment is warranted when the crime kills or injures bystanders or police.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.

				, Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;43&#x96;5&#x96;7.2; &#xA7;35&#x96;43&#x96;9&#x96;7.  In sum, &#xA7;&#xA7;3(b)(2) and (3) do not demonstrate that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is less risky than it otherwise seems, but instead support the idea that it is inherently risky.

				Looking to the elements, statistics, common experience, and cases, I conclude that in the ordinary case, Indiana&#x92;s crime of intentional vehicular flight, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A), &#x93;involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

						 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.  His &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road, weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house.  Ante, at 4; 2 App. 11 (Sealed).

						 Indiana law at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction presented two related provisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment.  One was a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a narrower provision that did not.  While Justice Kagan would infer that the offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky, post, at 6&#x96;8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.


Consider reckless endangerment statutes.  In Hawaii, for instance, it is &#x93;reckless endangering in the second degree&#x94; either to &#x93;recklessly plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,&#x94; Haw. Rev. Stat. &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to &#x93;[i]ntentionally discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,&#x94; &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(b).  I would infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given case.  Other States have similar statutes.  See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, &#xA7;&#xA7;603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#xA7;&#xA7;6&#x96;2&#x96;504(a), (b) (2009); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17&#x96;A, &#xA7;&#xA7;301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).


Similarly here, I infer that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A)&#x92;s upgrade of intentional flight to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the offense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).


Justice Kagan argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) when it added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Post, at 12.  There are at least two problems with this reasoning.  First, even though &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) may be redundant with &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in subsection (a)(3), the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).  Thus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  Second, although Justice Kagan can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require perfection in statutory drafting.  See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).  I think it clear enough what the statute means.

						 For that matter, each provision also could be satisfied by a flight that did not satisfy &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), which casts further doubt on Justice Kagan&#x92;s vision of the statutory scheme as a unified structure of neatly progressing offenses with corresponding risk levels and punishments.  See post, at 7.

				Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a felony.  Any person who &#x93;knowingly or intentionally &#x2026; flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered the person to stop&#x94; commits a misdemeanor.  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a)(3).  If the person &#x93;uses a vehicle&#x94; to flee, however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a &#x93;violent felony&#x94; under ACCA if it is &#x93;burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

				, 550 U. S., at 203.  The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars generally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward avoiding detection.

				In sum, every violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in front of a police officer.  Based on its elements, the potential risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles &#x93;armed burglary in the presence of a security guard&#x94; more than simple burglary.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with much more risk&#x97;a far greater likelihood of confrontation with police and a greater chance of violence in that
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				confrontation&#x97;than burglary.  It follows that the &#x93;the con-duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi-nary case,&#x94; poses a greater risk of harm than the enumerated offense of burglary.

				Sykes argues that intentional vehicular flight is not a violent felony for two main reasons.  First, he asserts that it is possible to violate Indiana&#x92;s intentional vehicular flight statute without doing anything dangerous.  Second, he urges that the existence of Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B), which includes &#x93;substantial risk&#x94; as an additional element, indicates that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.  Neither argument is persuasive.

The argument is that, even though the elements of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the presence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) casts &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous light.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, apart from the existence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), the absence of risk as an element of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) does not mean that the offense is not a violent felony.  ACCA does not require that a violent felony expressly include a risk of injury as an element of the offense.  Enumerated violent felonies like arson and burglary have no such element.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Both are class D felonies, and at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction, there was no statutory difference in punishment between them.  Even now, the offenses remain of a single class, meriting similar punishments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equivalent of one type of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) violation.  Section 3(b)(1)(B) enhances punishments for three separate types of in-tentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, &#xA7;3(a)(1); interfering with service of process, &#xA7;3(a)(2); and fleeing from a police officer, &#xA7;3(a)(3).  Under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), committing any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly weapon, inflicting injury, or &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; has long been a class D felony.

				In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to provide that 
				<em>
					any 
				</em>
				use of a vehicle to flee from an officer under &#xA7;3(a)(3) is 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 a class D felony.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment for one particular violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).

				  It is still the case that under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an officer or interfere with service of process is a class D felony only if the vehicle is &#x93;operate[d] &#x2026; in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  But using a vehicle to intentionally flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove risk.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).

				Third, the remainder of Indiana&#x92;s resisting law enforcement statute confirms that its other provisions do not reserve &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct.  An intentional vehicular flight becomes a class C felony if the vehicle is operated &#x93;in a manner that causes serious bodily injury.&#x94;  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(2).

				  Rather, each provision addresses what happens when the risk inherent

				<em>

				 was apparently clear enough to spur the Indiana Legislature to specify greater penalties for the inevitable occasions when physical injury actually occurs.  By comparison, for obviously nonrisky felonies like insurance fraud or misappropriation of escrow funds, legislatures do not specify what additional punishment is warranted when the crime kills or injures bystanders or police.  See,

						 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.  His &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road, weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house.  Ante, at 4; 2 App. 11 (Sealed).

						 Indiana law at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction presented two related provisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment.  One was a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a narrower provision that did not.  While Justice Kagan would infer that the offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky, post, at 6&#x96;8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.


Consider reckless endangerment statutes.  In Hawaii, for instance, it is &#x93;reckless endangering in the second degree&#x94; either to &#x93;recklessly plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,&#x94; Haw. Rev. Stat. &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to &#x93;[i]ntentionally discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,&#x94; &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(b).  I would infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given case.  Other States have similar statutes.  See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, &#xA7;&#xA7;603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#xA7;&#xA7;6&#x96;2&#x96;504(a), (b) (2009); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17&#x96;A, &#xA7;&#xA7;301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).


Similarly here, I infer that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A)&#x92;s upgrade of intentional flight to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the offense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).


Justice Kagan argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) when it added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Post, at 12.  There are at least two problems with this reasoning.  First, even though &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) may be redundant with &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in subsection (a)(3), the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).  Thus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  Second, although Justice Kagan can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require perfection in statutory drafting.  See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).  I think it clear enough what the statute means.

						 For that matter, each provision also could be satisfied by a flight that did not satisfy &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), which casts further doubt on Justice Kagan&#x92;s vision of the statutory scheme as a unified structure of neatly progressing offenses with corresponding risk levels and punishments.

				Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a felony.  Any person who &#x93;knowingly or intentionally &#x2026; flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered the person to stop&#x94; commits a misdemeanor.  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a)(3).  If the person &#x93;uses a vehicle&#x94; to flee, however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a &#x93;violent felony&#x94; under ACCA if it is &#x93;burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

.  As this Court has recognized, the risk of burglary is in &#x93;the possibility that an innocent person might appear while the crime is in progress&#x94; and the danger inherent in such a &#x93;face-to-face confrontation.&#x94;

The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars generally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward avoiding detection.  Nevertheless, that small chance sufficed for Congress to list burglary as a &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; and for this Court to hold that attempted burglary also qualifies.  See

				Compared to burglary, the elements of intentional vehicular flight describe conduct that ordinarily poses greater potential risk.  Although interruption and confrontation are quite rare for burglary, 
				<em>
					every
				</em>
				 &#xA7;3(a)(3) flight is committed in the presence of a police officer.  
				<em>
					Every 
				</em>
				&#xA7;3(a)(3) flight also involves a perpetrator acting in knowing defiance
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				of an officer&#x92;s direct order to stop, &#x93;which is a clear challenge to the officer&#x92;s authority and typically initiates pursuit.&#x94;

				In sum, every violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in front of a police officer.  Based on its elements, the potential risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles &#x93;armed burglary in the presence of a security guard&#x94; more than simple burglary.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with much more risk&#x97;a far greater likelihood of confrontation with police and a greater chance of violence in that
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				confrontation&#x97;than burglary.  It follows that the &#x93;the con-duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi-nary case,&#x94; poses a greater risk of harm than the enumerated offense of burglary.

 (statistical evidence, though not always necessary, &#x93;strongly supports the intuitive belief that failure to report does not involve a serious potential risk of physical injury&#x94;).  Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that approximately 100 police officers, pedestrians, and occupants of other cars are killed each year in chase-related crashes.  National Center for Statistics &amp; Analysis, Fatalities in Motor Vehicle Traffic Crashes Involving Police in Pursuit 37&#x96;56 (2010) (reporting 1,269 such deaths between 2000 and 2009).

				The number injured must be much higher.  Many thousands of police chases occur every year.  In California and Pennsylvania, which collect statewide pursuit data, police were involved in a combined total of more than 8,700 chases in 2007 alone.  See Pennsylvania State Police Bureau of Research &amp; Development, Police Pursuits 2007 Annual Report; Report to the Legislature, Senate Bill 719, California Police Pursuits (March 2008); see also Schultz, Hudak, &amp; Alpert, Emergency Driving and Pursuits, FBI Law Enforcement Bulletin, Apr. 2009, pp. 1, 4 (surveying more than 2,100 police officers and finding an average of just over one pursuit per officer each year).  And up to 41% of all chases involve a crash, which always carries some risk of injury.

Police Strategies &amp; Management 729, 740 (1997) (citing nine studies, each showing a crash rate between 18% and 41%).  Indeed, studies show that 4% to 17% of all chases actually cause injury.

				Sykes argues that intentional vehicular flight is not a violent felony for two main reasons.  First, he asserts that it is possible to violate Indiana&#x92;s intentional vehicular flight statute without doing anything dangerous.  Second, he urges that the existence of Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B), which includes &#x93;substantial risk&#x94; as an additional element, indicates that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.  Neither argument is persuasive.

				The fact that Sykes can imagine a nonrisky way to violate &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) does not disprove that intentional vehicular flight is dangerous &#x93;in the ordinary case.&#x94;  See 
				<em>
					James

				Nor has Sykes established that the nonrisky scenario he imagines is the ordinary violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Sykes offers nothing more than two Indiana cases that, in his view, are instances of nonrisky vehicular flight.  See 
				<em>
					Swain

				 v.

				 at 898.  Yet not even those cases obviously involve nonrisky conduct.  In 
				<em>
					Swain
				</em>
				, the defendant was a getaway driver who picked up her boyfriend&#x92;s accomplice as he ran on foot from two police officers.  2010 WL 623720, *1, *3.  As the officers approached the car and shouted to stop, she yelled, &#x93; &#x91;Hurry up.  Come on.  They&#x92;re coming,&#x92; &#x94; and drove off as the runner jumped in.  
				<em>

				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  In 
				<em>
					Woodward
				</em>
				, the defendant ignored a police siren for approximately a mile, passed several good places to pull over, and drove all the way home, but traveled at the speed limit of 45 mph and obeyed traffic laws.  770 N. E. 2d, at 898.  Eventually the defendant got out of his car and shouted profanities at the officer, who drew his pistol.

From this, Sykes infers that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) necessarily concerns only flight that does not present a serious potential risk.  The argument is that, even though the elements of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the presence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) casts &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous light.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				as an element does not restrict &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to nonrisky

				conduct.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, apart from the existence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), the absence of risk as an element of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) does not mean that the offense is not a violent felony.  ACCA does not require that a violent felony expressly include a risk of injury as an element of the offense.  Enumerated violent felonies like arson and burglary have no such element.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Both are class D felonies, and at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction, there was no statutory difference in punishment between them.  Even now, the offenses remain of a single class, meriting similar punishments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equivalent of one type of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) violation.  Section 3(b)(1)(B) enhances punishments for three separate types of in-tentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, &#xA7;3(a)(1); interfering with service of process, &#xA7;3(a)(2); and fleeing from a police officer, &#xA7;3(a)(3).  Under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), committing any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly weapon, inflicting injury, or &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; has long been a class D felony.

				In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to provide that 
				<em>
					any 
				</em>
				use of a vehicle to flee from an officer under &#xA7;3(a)(3) is 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 a class D felony.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment for one particular violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).

				  It is still the case that under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an officer or interfere with service of process is a class D felony only if the vehicle is &#x93;operate[d] &#x2026; in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  But using a vehicle to intentionally flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove risk.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).

				This rough equivalence between &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) and &#xA7;3(b)

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				underlying the Indiana cases discussed above, see

				Third, the remainder of Indiana&#x92;s resisting law enforcement statute confirms that its other provisions do not reserve &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct.  An intentional vehicular flight becomes a class C felony if the vehicle is operated &#x93;in a manner that causes serious bodily injury.&#x94;  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(2).

				 was apparently clear enough to spur the Indiana Legislature to specify greater penalties for the inevitable occasions when physical injury actually occurs.  By comparison, for obviously nonrisky felonies like insurance fraud or misappropriation of escrow funds, legislatures do not specify what additional punishment is warranted when the crime kills or injures bystanders or police.  See,

				, Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;43&#x96;5&#x96;7.2; &#xA7;35&#x96;43&#x96;9&#x96;7.  In sum, &#xA7;&#xA7;3(b)(2) and (3) do not demonstrate that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is less risky than it otherwise seems, but instead support the idea that it is inherently risky.

				Looking to the elements, statistics, common experience, and cases, I conclude that in the ordinary case, Indiana&#x92;s crime of intentional vehicular flight, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A), &#x93;involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

						 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.  His &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road, weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house.  Ante, at 4; 2 App. 11 (Sealed).

						 Indiana law at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction presented two related provisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment.  One was a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a narrower provision that did not.  While Justice Kagan would infer that the offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky, post, at 6&#x96;8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.


Consider reckless endangerment statutes.  In Hawaii, for instance, it is &#x93;reckless endangering in the second degree&#x94; either to &#x93;recklessly plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,&#x94; Haw. Rev. Stat. &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to &#x93;[i]ntentionally discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,&#x94; &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(b).  I would infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given case.  Other States have similar statutes.  See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, &#xA7;&#xA7;603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#xA7;&#xA7;6&#x96;2&#x96;504(a), (b) (2009); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17&#x96;A, &#xA7;&#xA7;301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).


Similarly here, I infer that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A)&#x92;s upgrade of intentional flight to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the offense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).


Justice Kagan argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) when it added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Post, at 12.  There are at least two problems with this reasoning.  First, even though &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) may be redundant with &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in subsection (a)(3), the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).  Thus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  Second, although Justice Kagan can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require perfection in statutory drafting.  See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).  I think it clear enough what the statute means.

						 For that matter, each provision also could be satisfied by a flight that did not satisfy &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), which casts further doubt on Justice Kagan&#x92;s vision of the statutory scheme as a unified structure of neatly progressing offenses with corresponding risk levels and punishments.  See post, at 7.

				Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a felony.  Any person who &#x93;knowingly or intentionally &#x2026; flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered the person to stop&#x94; commits a misdemeanor.  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a)(3).  If the person &#x93;uses a vehicle&#x94; to flee, however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a &#x93;violent felony&#x94; under ACCA if it is &#x93;burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

				, 550 U. S., at 203.  The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars generally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward avoiding detection.

				In sum, every violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in front of a police officer.  Based on its elements, the potential risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles &#x93;armed burglary in the presence of a security guard&#x94; more than simple burglary.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with much more risk&#x97;a far greater likelihood of confrontation with police and a greater chance of violence in that
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				confrontation&#x97;than burglary.  It follows that the &#x93;the con-duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi-nary case,&#x94; poses a greater risk of harm than the enumerated offense of burglary.

				Sykes argues that intentional vehicular flight is not a violent felony for two main reasons.  First, he asserts that it is possible to violate Indiana&#x92;s intentional vehicular flight statute without doing anything dangerous.  Second, he urges that the existence of Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B), which includes &#x93;substantial risk&#x94; as an additional element, indicates that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.  Neither argument is persuasive.

The argument is that, even though the elements of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the presence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) casts &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous light.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, apart from the existence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), the absence of risk as an element of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) does not mean that the offense is not a violent felony.  ACCA does not require that a violent felony expressly include a risk of injury as an element of the offense.  Enumerated violent felonies like arson and burglary have no such element.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Both are class D felonies, and at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction, there was no statutory difference in punishment between them.  Even now, the offenses remain of a single class, meriting similar punishments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equivalent of one type of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) violation.  Section 3(b)(1)(B) enhances punishments for three separate types of in-tentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, &#xA7;3(a)(1); interfering with service of process, &#xA7;3(a)(2); and fleeing from a police officer, &#xA7;3(a)(3).  Under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), committing any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly weapon, inflicting injury, or &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; has long been a class D felony.

				In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to provide that 
				<em>
					any 
				</em>
				use of a vehicle to flee from an officer under &#xA7;3(a)(3) is 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 a class D felony.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment for one particular violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).

				  It is still the case that under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an officer or interfere with service of process is a class D felony only if the vehicle is &#x93;operate[d] &#x2026; in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  But using a vehicle to intentionally flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove risk.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).

				This rough equivalence between &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) and &#xA7;3(b)

				Third, the remainder of Indiana&#x92;s resisting law enforcement statute confirms that its other provisions do not reserve &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct.  An intentional vehicular flight becomes a class C felony if the vehicle is operated &#x93;in a manner that causes serious bodily injury.&#x94;  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(2).

				  Rather, each provision addresses what happens when the risk inherent

				<em>

				 was apparently clear enough to spur the Indiana Legislature to specify greater penalties for the inevitable occasions when physical injury actually occurs.  By comparison, for obviously nonrisky felonies like insurance fraud or misappropriation of escrow funds, legislatures do not specify what additional punishment is warranted when the crime kills or injures bystanders or police.  See,

						 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.  His &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road, weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house.  Ante, at 4; 2 App. 11 (Sealed).

						 Indiana law at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction presented two related provisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment.  One was a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a narrower provision that did not.  While Justice Kagan would infer that the offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky, post, at 6&#x96;8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.


Consider reckless endangerment statutes.  In Hawaii, for instance, it is &#x93;reckless endangering in the second degree&#x94; either to &#x93;recklessly plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,&#x94; Haw. Rev. Stat. &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to &#x93;[i]ntentionally discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,&#x94; &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(b).  I would infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given case.  Other States have similar statutes.  See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, &#xA7;&#xA7;603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#xA7;&#xA7;6&#x96;2&#x96;504(a), (b) (2009); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17&#x96;A, &#xA7;&#xA7;301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).


Similarly here, I infer that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A)&#x92;s upgrade of intentional flight to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the offense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).


Justice Kagan argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) when it added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Post, at 12.  There are at least two problems with this reasoning.  First, even though &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) may be redundant with &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in subsection (a)(3), the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).  Thus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  Second, although Justice Kagan can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require perfection in statutory drafting.  See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).  I think it clear enough what the statute means.

						 For that matter, each provision also could be satisfied by a flight that did not satisfy &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), which casts further doubt on Justice Kagan&#x92;s vision of the statutory scheme as a unified structure of neatly progressing offenses with corresponding risk levels and punishments.

				Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a felony.  Any person who &#x93;knowingly or intentionally &#x2026; flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered the person to stop&#x94; commits a misdemeanor.  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a)(3).  If the person &#x93;uses a vehicle&#x94; to flee, however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a &#x93;violent felony&#x94; under ACCA if it is &#x93;burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars generally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward avoiding detection.  Nevertheless, that small chance sufficed for Congress to list burglary as a &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; and for this Court to hold that attempted burglary also qualifies.  See

				Compared to burglary, the elements of intentional vehicular flight describe conduct that ordinarily poses greater potential risk.  Although interruption and confrontation are quite rare for burglary, 
				<em>
					every

				 &#xA7;3(a)(3) flight is committed in the presence of a police officer.  
				<em>

				&#xA7;3(a)(3) flight also involves a perpetrator acting in knowing defiance

				In sum, every violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in front of a police officer.  Based on its elements, the potential risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles &#x93;armed burglary in the presence of a security guard&#x94; more than simple burglary.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with much more risk&#x97;a far greater likelihood of confrontation with police and a greater chance of violence in that
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				confrontation&#x97;than burglary.  It follows that the &#x93;the con-duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi-nary case,&#x94; poses a greater risk of harm than the enumerated offense of burglary.

Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that approximately 100 police officers, pedestrians, and occupants of other cars are killed each year in chase-related crashes.

And up to 41% of all chases involve a crash, which always carries some risk of injury.

				Sykes argues that intentional vehicular flight is not a violent felony for two main reasons.  First, he asserts that it is possible to violate Indiana&#x92;s intentional vehicular flight statute without doing anything dangerous.  Second, he urges that the existence of Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B), which includes &#x93;substantial risk&#x94; as an additional element, indicates that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.  Neither argument is persuasive.

				<em>

				Nor has Sykes established that the nonrisky scenario he imagines is the ordinary violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Sykes offers nothing more than two Indiana cases that, in his view, are instances of nonrisky vehicular flight.  See 
				<em>
					Swain

				, the defendant was a getaway driver who picked up her boyfriend&#x92;s accomplice as he ran on foot from two police officers.  2010 WL 623720, *1, *3.  As the officers approached the car and shouted to stop, she yelled, &#x93; &#x91;Hurry up.  Come on.  They&#x92;re coming,&#x92; &#x94; and drove off as the runner jumped in.

				<em>

From this, Sykes infers that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) necessarily concerns only flight that does not present a serious potential risk.  The argument is that, even though the elements of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the presence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) casts &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous light.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				as an element does not restrict &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to nonrisky

				conduct.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, apart from the existence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), the absence of risk as an element of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) does not mean that the offense is not a violent felony.  ACCA does not require that a violent felony expressly include a risk of injury as an element of the offense.  Enumerated violent felonies like arson and burglary have no such element.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Both are class D felonies, and at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction, there was no statutory difference in punishment between them.  Even now, the offenses remain of a single class, meriting similar punishments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equivalent of one type of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) violation.  Section 3(b)(1)(B) enhances punishments for three separate types of in-tentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, &#xA7;3(a)(1); interfering with service of process, &#xA7;3(a)(2); and fleeing from a police officer, &#xA7;3(a)(3).  Under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), committing any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly weapon, inflicting injury, or &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; has long been a class D felony.

				In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to provide that 
				<em>
					any 
				</em>
				use of a vehicle to flee from an officer under &#xA7;3(a)(3) is 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 a class D felony.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment for one particular violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).

				  It is still the case that under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an officer or interfere with service of process is a class D felony only if the vehicle is &#x93;operate[d] &#x2026; in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  But using a vehicle to intentionally flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove risk.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).

				This rough equivalence between &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) and &#xA7;3(b)

				<span class="softbreak"/>

				Third, the remainder of Indiana&#x92;s resisting law enforcement statute confirms that its other provisions do not reserve &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct.  An intentional vehicular flight becomes a class C felony if the vehicle is operated &#x93;in a manner that causes serious bodily injury.&#x94;  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(2).

				Looking to the elements, statistics, common experience, and cases, I conclude that in the ordinary case, Indiana&#x92;s crime of intentional vehicular flight, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A), &#x93;involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

						 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.  His &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road, weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house.  Ante, at 4; 2 App. 11 (Sealed).

						 Indiana law at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction presented two related provisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment.  One was a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a narrower provision that did not.  While Justice Kagan would infer that the offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky, post, at 6&#x96;8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.


Consider reckless endangerment statutes.  In Hawaii, for instance, it is &#x93;reckless endangering in the second degree&#x94; either to &#x93;recklessly plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,&#x94; Haw. Rev. Stat. &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to &#x93;[i]ntentionally discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,&#x94; &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(b).  I would infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given case.  Other States have similar statutes.  See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, &#xA7;&#xA7;603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#xA7;&#xA7;6&#x96;2&#x96;504(a), (b) (2009); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17&#x96;A, &#xA7;&#xA7;301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).


Similarly here, I infer that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A)&#x92;s upgrade of intentional flight to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the offense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).


Justice Kagan argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) when it added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Post, at 12.  There are at least two problems with this reasoning.  First, even though &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) may be redundant with &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in subsection (a)(3), the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).  Thus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  Second, although Justice Kagan can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require perfection in statutory drafting.  See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).  I think it clear enough what the statute means.

						 For that matter, each provision also could be satisfied by a flight that did not satisfy &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), which casts further doubt on Justice Kagan&#x92;s vision of the statutory scheme as a unified structure of neatly progressing offenses with corresponding risk levels and punishments.  See post, at 7.

				Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a felony.  Any person who &#x93;knowingly or intentionally &#x2026; flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered the person to stop&#x94; commits a misdemeanor.  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a)(3).  If the person &#x93;uses a vehicle&#x94; to flee, however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a &#x93;violent felony&#x94; under ACCA if it is &#x93;burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

				, 550 U. S., at 203.  The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars generally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward avoiding detection.  Nevertheless, that small chance sufficed for Congress to list burglary as a &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; and for this Court to hold that attempted burglary also qualifies.  See

				Compared to burglary, the elements of intentional vehicular flight describe conduct that ordinarily poses greater potential risk.  Although interruption and confrontation are quite rare for burglary,

				In sum, every violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in front of a police officer.  Based on its elements, the potential risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles &#x93;armed burglary in the presence of a security guard&#x94; more than simple burglary.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with much more risk&#x97;a far greater likelihood of confrontation with police and a greater chance of violence in that
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				confrontation&#x97;than burglary.  It follows that the &#x93;the con-duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi-nary case,&#x94; poses a greater risk of harm than the enumerated offense of burglary.

Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that approximately 100 police officers, pedestrians, and occupants of other cars are killed each year in chase-related crashes.

				Sykes argues that intentional vehicular flight is not a violent felony for two main reasons.  First, he asserts that it is possible to violate Indiana&#x92;s intentional vehicular flight statute without doing anything dangerous.  Second, he urges that the existence of Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B), which includes &#x93;substantial risk&#x94; as an additional element, indicates that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.  Neither argument is persuasive.

The argument is that, even though the elements of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the presence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) casts &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous light.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, apart from the existence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), the absence of risk as an element of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) does not mean that the offense is not a violent felony.  ACCA does not require that a violent felony expressly include a risk of injury as an element of the offense.  Enumerated violent felonies like arson and burglary have no such element.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Both are class D felonies, and at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction, there was no statutory difference in punishment between them.  Even now, the offenses remain of a single class, meriting similar punishments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equivalent of one type of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) violation.  Section 3(b)(1)(B) enhances punishments for three separate types of in-tentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, &#xA7;3(a)(1); interfering with service of process, &#xA7;3(a)(2); and fleeing from a police officer, &#xA7;3(a)(3).  Under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), committing any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly weapon, inflicting injury, or &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; has long been a class D felony.

				In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to provide that 
				<em>
					any 
				</em>
				use of a vehicle to flee from an officer under &#xA7;3(a)(3) is 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 a class D felony.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment for one particular violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).

				  It is still the case that under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an officer or interfere with service of process is a class D felony only if the vehicle is &#x93;operate[d] &#x2026; in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  But using a vehicle to intentionally flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove risk.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).

				This rough equivalence between &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) and &#xA7;3(b)

				Third, the remainder of Indiana&#x92;s resisting law enforcement statute confirms that its other provisions do not reserve &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct.  An intentional vehicular flight becomes a class C felony if the vehicle is operated &#x93;in a manner that causes serious bodily injury.&#x94;  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(2).

				  Rather, each provision addresses what happens when the risk inherent

				<em>

				 was apparently clear enough to spur the Indiana Legislature to specify greater penalties for the inevitable occasions when physical injury actually occurs.  By comparison, for obviously nonrisky felonies like insurance fraud or misappropriation of escrow funds, legislatures do not specify what additional punishment is warranted when the crime kills or injures bystanders or police.  See,

						 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.  His &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road, weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house.  Ante, at 4; 2 App. 11 (Sealed).

						 Indiana law at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction presented two related provisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment.  One was a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a narrower provision that did not.  While Justice Kagan would infer that the offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky, post, at 6&#x96;8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.


Consider reckless endangerment statutes.  In Hawaii, for instance, it is &#x93;reckless endangering in the second degree&#x94; either to &#x93;recklessly plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,&#x94; Haw. Rev. Stat. &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to &#x93;[i]ntentionally discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,&#x94; &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(b).  I would infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given case.  Other States have similar statutes.  See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, &#xA7;&#xA7;603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#xA7;&#xA7;6&#x96;2&#x96;504(a), (b) (2009); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17&#x96;A, &#xA7;&#xA7;301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).


Similarly here, I infer that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A)&#x92;s upgrade of intentional flight to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the offense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).


Justice Kagan argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) when it added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Post, at 12.  There are at least two problems with this reasoning.  First, even though &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) may be redundant with &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in subsection (a)(3), the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).  Thus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  Second, although Justice Kagan can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require perfection in statutory drafting.  See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).  I think it clear enough what the statute means.

						 For that matter, each provision also could be satisfied by a flight that did not satisfy &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), which casts further doubt on Justice Kagan&#x92;s vision of the statutory scheme as a unified structure of neatly progressing offenses with corresponding risk levels and punishments.

				Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a felony.  Any person who &#x93;knowingly or intentionally &#x2026; flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered the person to stop&#x94; commits a misdemeanor.  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a)(3).  If the person &#x93;uses a vehicle&#x94; to flee, however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a &#x93;violent felony&#x94; under ACCA if it is &#x93;burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars generally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward avoiding detection.  Nevertheless, that small chance sufficed for Congress to list burglary as a &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; and for this Court to hold that attempted burglary also qualifies.  See

				Compared to burglary, the elements of intentional vehicular flight describe conduct that ordinarily poses greater potential risk.  Although interruption and confrontation are quite rare for burglary, 
				<em>
					every

				 &#xA7;3(a)(3) flight is committed in the presence of a police officer.  
				<em>

				&#xA7;3(a)(3) flight also involves a perpetrator acting in knowing defiance

				In sum, every violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in front of a police officer.  Based on its elements, the potential risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles &#x93;armed burglary in the presence of a security guard&#x94; more than simple burglary.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with much more risk&#x97;a far greater likelihood of confrontation with police and a greater chance of violence in that
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				confrontation&#x97;than burglary.  It follows that the &#x93;the con-duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi-nary case,&#x94; poses a greater risk of harm than the enumerated offense of burglary.

Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that approximately 100 police officers, pedestrians, and occupants of other cars are killed each year in chase-related crashes.

And up to 41% of all chases involve a crash, which always carries some risk of injury.

				Sykes argues that intentional vehicular flight is not a violent felony for two main reasons.  First, he asserts that it is possible to violate Indiana&#x92;s intentional vehicular flight statute without doing anything dangerous.  Second, he urges that the existence of Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B), which includes &#x93;substantial risk&#x94; as an additional element, indicates that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.  Neither argument is persuasive.

				<em>

				Nor has Sykes established that the nonrisky scenario he imagines is the ordinary violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Sykes offers nothing more than two Indiana cases that, in his view, are instances of nonrisky vehicular flight.  See 
				<em>
					Swain

				, the defendant was a getaway driver who picked up her boyfriend&#x92;s accomplice as he ran on foot from two police officers.  2010 WL 623720, *1, *3.  As the officers approached the car and shouted to stop, she yelled, &#x93; &#x91;Hurry up.  Come on.  They&#x92;re coming,&#x92; &#x94; and drove off as the runner jumped in.

				<em>

From this, Sykes infers that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) necessarily concerns only flight that does not present a serious potential risk.  The argument is that, even though the elements of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the presence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) casts &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous light.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				as an element does not restrict &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to nonrisky

				conduct.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, apart from the existence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), the absence of risk as an element of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) does not mean that the offense is not a violent felony.  ACCA does not require that a violent felony expressly include a risk of injury as an element of the offense.  Enumerated violent felonies like arson and burglary have no such element.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Both are class D felonies, and at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction, there was no statutory difference in punishment between them.  Even now, the offenses remain of a single class, meriting similar punishments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equivalent of one type of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) violation.  Section 3(b)(1)(B) enhances punishments for three separate types of in-tentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, &#xA7;3(a)(1); interfering with service of process, &#xA7;3(a)(2); and fleeing from a police officer, &#xA7;3(a)(3).  Under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), committing any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly weapon, inflicting injury, or &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; has long been a class D felony.

				In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to provide that 
				<em>
					any 
				</em>
				use of a vehicle to flee from an officer under &#xA7;3(a)(3) is 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 a class D felony.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment for one particular violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).

				  It is still the case that under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an officer or interfere with service of process is a class D felony only if the vehicle is &#x93;operate[d] &#x2026; in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  But using a vehicle to intentionally flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove risk.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).

				This rough equivalence between &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) and &#xA7;3(b)

				<span class="softbreak"/>

				Third, the remainder of Indiana&#x92;s resisting law enforcement statute confirms that its other provisions do not reserve &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct.  An intentional vehicular flight becomes a class C felony if the vehicle is operated &#x93;in a manner that causes serious bodily injury.&#x94;  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(2).

				Looking to the elements, statistics, common experience, and cases, I conclude that in the ordinary case, Indiana&#x92;s crime of intentional vehicular flight, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A), &#x93;involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

						 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.  His &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road, weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house.  Ante, at 4; 2 App. 11 (Sealed).

						 Indiana law at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction presented two related provisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment.  One was a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a narrower provision that did not.  While Justice Kagan would infer that the offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky, post, at 6&#x96;8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.


Consider reckless endangerment statutes.  In Hawaii, for instance, it is &#x93;reckless endangering in the second degree&#x94; either to &#x93;recklessly plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,&#x94; Haw. Rev. Stat. &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to &#x93;[i]ntentionally discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,&#x94; &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(b).  I would infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given case.  Other States have similar statutes.  See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, &#xA7;&#xA7;603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#xA7;&#xA7;6&#x96;2&#x96;504(a), (b) (2009); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17&#x96;A, &#xA7;&#xA7;301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).


Similarly here, I infer that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A)&#x92;s upgrade of intentional flight to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the offense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).


Justice Kagan argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) when it added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Post, at 12.  There are at least two problems with this reasoning.  First, even though &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) may be redundant with &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in subsection (a)(3), the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).  Thus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  Second, although Justice Kagan can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require perfection in statutory drafting.  See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).  I think it clear enough what the statute means.

						 For that matter, each provision also could be satisfied by a flight that did not satisfy &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), which casts further doubt on Justice Kagan&#x92;s vision of the statutory scheme as a unified structure of neatly progressing offenses with corresponding risk levels and punishments.  See post, at 7.

				Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a felony.  Any person who &#x93;knowingly or intentionally &#x2026; flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered the person to stop&#x94; commits a misdemeanor.  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a)(3).  If the person &#x93;uses a vehicle&#x94; to flee, however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a &#x93;violent felony&#x94; under ACCA if it is &#x93;burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

				, 550 U. S., at 203.  The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars generally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward avoiding detection.  Nevertheless, that small chance sufficed for Congress to list burglary as a &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; and for this Court to hold that attempted burglary also qualifies.  See

				Compared to burglary, the elements of intentional vehicular flight describe conduct that ordinarily poses greater potential risk.  Although interruption and confrontation are quite rare for burglary,

				In sum, every violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in front of a police officer.  Based on its elements, the potential risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles &#x93;armed burglary in the presence of a security guard&#x94; more than simple burglary.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with much more risk&#x97;a far greater likelihood of confrontation with police and a greater chance of violence in that
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				confrontation&#x97;than burglary.  It follows that the &#x93;the con-duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi-nary case,&#x94; poses a greater risk of harm than the enumerated offense of burglary.

Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that approximately 100 police officers, pedestrians, and occupants of other cars are killed each year in chase-related crashes.

				Sykes argues that intentional vehicular flight is not a violent felony for two main reasons.  First, he asserts that it is possible to violate Indiana&#x92;s intentional vehicular flight statute without doing anything dangerous.  Second, he urges that the existence of Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B), which includes &#x93;substantial risk&#x94; as an additional element, indicates that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.  Neither argument is persuasive.

The argument is that, even though the elements of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the presence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) casts &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous light.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, apart from the existence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), the absence of risk as an element of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) does not mean that the offense is not a violent felony.  ACCA does not require that a violent felony expressly include a risk of injury as an element of the offense.  Enumerated violent felonies like arson and burglary have no such element.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Both are class D felonies, and at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction, there was no statutory difference in punishment between them.  Even now, the offenses remain of a single class, meriting similar punishments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equivalent of one type of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) violation.  Section 3(b)(1)(B) enhances punishments for three separate types of in-tentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, &#xA7;3(a)(1); interfering with service of process, &#xA7;3(a)(2); and fleeing from a police officer, &#xA7;3(a)(3).  Under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), committing any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly weapon, inflicting injury, or &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; has long been a class D felony.

				In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to provide that 
				<em>
					any 
				</em>
				use of a vehicle to flee from an officer under &#xA7;3(a)(3) is 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 a class D felony.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment for one particular violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).

				  It is still the case that under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an officer or interfere with service of process is a class D felony only if the vehicle is &#x93;operate[d] &#x2026; in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  But using a vehicle to intentionally flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove risk.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).

				This rough equivalence between &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) and &#xA7;3(b)

				Third, the remainder of Indiana&#x92;s resisting law enforcement statute confirms that its other provisions do not reserve &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct.  An intentional vehicular flight becomes a class C felony if the vehicle is operated &#x93;in a manner that causes serious bodily injury.&#x94;  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(2).

				  Rather, each provision addresses what happens when the risk inherent

				<em>

				 was apparently clear enough to spur the Indiana Legislature to specify greater penalties for the inevitable occasions when physical injury actually occurs.  By comparison, for obviously nonrisky felonies like insurance fraud or misappropriation of escrow funds, legislatures do not specify what additional punishment is warranted when the crime kills or injures bystanders or police.  See,

						 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.  His &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road, weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house.  Ante, at 4; 2 App. 11 (Sealed).

						 Indiana law at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction presented two related provisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment.  One was a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a narrower provision that did not.  While Justice Kagan would infer that the offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky, post, at 6&#x96;8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.


Consider reckless endangerment statutes.  In Hawaii, for instance, it is &#x93;reckless endangering in the second degree&#x94; either to &#x93;recklessly plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,&#x94; Haw. Rev. Stat. &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to &#x93;[i]ntentionally discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,&#x94; &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(b).  I would infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given case.  Other States have similar statutes.  See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, &#xA7;&#xA7;603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#xA7;&#xA7;6&#x96;2&#x96;504(a), (b) (2009); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17&#x96;A, &#xA7;&#xA7;301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).


Similarly here, I infer that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A)&#x92;s upgrade of intentional flight to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the offense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).


Justice Kagan argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) when it added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Post, at 12.  There are at least two problems with this reasoning.  First, even though &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) may be redundant with &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in subsection (a)(3), the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).  Thus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  Second, although Justice Kagan can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require perfection in statutory drafting.  See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).  I think it clear enough what the statute means.

						 For that matter, each provision also could be satisfied by a flight that did not satisfy &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), which casts further doubt on Justice Kagan&#x92;s vision of the statutory scheme as a unified structure of neatly progressing offenses with corresponding risk levels and punishments.

				Under Indiana law, intentional vehicular flight is a felony.  Any person who &#x93;knowingly or intentionally &#x2026; flees from a law enforcement officer after the officer has, by visible or audible means, identified himself and ordered the person to stop&#x94; commits a misdemeanor.  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(a)(3).  If the person &#x93;uses a vehicle&#x94; to flee, however, the offense is elevated to a class D felony.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  That felony, the parties agree, qualifies as a &#x93;violent felony&#x94; under ACCA if it is &#x93;burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

The chance of an interruption or confrontation in an ordinary burglary is, of course, quite small; burglars generally plan and commit their crimes with an eye toward avoiding detection.  Nevertheless, that small chance sufficed for Congress to list burglary as a &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; and for this Court to hold that attempted burglary also qualifies.  See

				Compared to burglary, the elements of intentional vehicular flight describe conduct that ordinarily poses greater potential risk.  Although interruption and confrontation are quite rare for burglary, 
				<em>
					every

				 &#xA7;3(a)(3) flight is committed in the presence of a police officer.  
				<em>

				&#xA7;3(a)(3) flight also involves a perpetrator acting in knowing defiance

				In sum, every violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) involves a defiant suspect with a dangerous weapon committing a felony in front of a police officer.  Based on its elements, the potential risk of intentional vehicular flight resembles &#x93;armed burglary in the presence of a security guard&#x94; more than simple burglary.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) outlaws conduct with much more risk&#x97;a far greater likelihood of confrontation with police and a greater chance of violence in that
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				confrontation&#x97;than burglary.  It follows that the &#x93;the con-duct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordi-nary case,&#x94; poses a greater risk of harm than the enumerated offense of burglary.

Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows that approximately 100 police officers, pedestrians, and occupants of other cars are killed each year in chase-related crashes.

And up to 41% of all chases involve a crash, which always carries some risk of injury.

				Sykes argues that intentional vehicular flight is not a violent felony for two main reasons.  First, he asserts that it is possible to violate Indiana&#x92;s intentional vehicular flight statute without doing anything dangerous.  Second, he urges that the existence of Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(1)(B), which includes &#x93;substantial risk&#x94; as an additional element, indicates that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is nonrisky.  Neither argument is persuasive.

				<em>

				Nor has Sykes established that the nonrisky scenario he imagines is the ordinary violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Sykes offers nothing more than two Indiana cases that, in his view, are instances of nonrisky vehicular flight.  See 
				<em>
					Swain

				, the defendant was a getaway driver who picked up her boyfriend&#x92;s accomplice as he ran on foot from two police officers.  2010 WL 623720, *1, *3.  As the officers approached the car and shouted to stop, she yelled, &#x93; &#x91;Hurry up.  Come on.  They&#x92;re coming,&#x92; &#x94; and drove off as the runner jumped in.

				<em>

From this, Sykes infers that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) necessarily concerns only flight that does not present a serious potential risk.  The argument is that, even though the elements of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) describe conduct that ordinarily will satisfy the requisite level of risk, the presence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) casts &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) in a less dangerous light.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				as an element does not restrict &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to nonrisky

				conduct.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				First, apart from the existence of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), the absence of risk as an element of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) does not mean that the offense is not a violent felony.  ACCA does not require that a violent felony expressly include a risk of injury as an element of the offense.  Enumerated violent felonies like arson and burglary have no such element.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is not a risky, aggravated version
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Both are class D felonies, and at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction, there was no statutory difference in punishment between them.  Even now, the offenses remain of a single class, meriting similar punishments.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The similarity in punishment for these related, overlapping offenses suggests that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) is the rough equivalent of one type of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) violation.  Section 3(b)(1)(B) enhances punishments for three separate types of in-tentional misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, &#xA7;3(a)(1); interfering with service of process, &#xA7;3(a)(2); and fleeing from a police officer, &#xA7;3(a)(3).  Under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), committing any of those offenses while also drawing a deadly weapon, inflicting injury, or &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; has long been a class D felony.

				In 1998, the Indiana Legislature added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) to provide that 
				<em>
					any 
				</em>
				use of a vehicle to flee from an officer under &#xA7;3(a)(3) is 
				<em>
					always
				</em>
				 a class D felony.  Section 3(b)(1)(A) is, in effect, a shortcut to the same punishment for one particular violation of &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).

				  It is still the case that under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), using a vehicle to obstruct an officer or interfere with service of process is a class D felony only if the vehicle is &#x93;operate[d] &#x2026; in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person.&#x94;  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  But using a vehicle to intentionally flee is always a class D felony, without any need to prove risk.  &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).

				This rough equivalence between &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) and &#xA7;3(b)

				<span class="softbreak"/>

				Third, the remainder of Indiana&#x92;s resisting law enforcement statute confirms that its other provisions do not reserve &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) for nonrisky conduct.  An intentional vehicular flight becomes a class C felony if the vehicle is operated &#x93;in a manner that causes serious bodily injury.&#x94;  Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3(b)(2).

				Looking to the elements, statistics, common experience, and cases, I conclude that in the ordinary case, Indiana&#x92;s crime of intentional vehicular flight, &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A), &#x93;involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

						 Sykes certainly cannot use his own flight as an example.  His &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) conviction was based on fleeing from police in a damaged car at night without headlights, driving on the wrong side of the road, weaving through traffic, barreling through two yards and among bystanders, destroying a fence, and crashing into a house.  Ante, at 4; 2 App. 11 (Sealed).

						 Indiana law at the time of Sykes&#x92; conviction presented two related provisions, within a single statute, carrying the same punishment.  One was a broad provision that had risk as an element, and the other was a narrower provision that did not.  While Justice Kagan would infer that the offense lacking risk as an element was likely not ordinarily risky, post, at 6&#x96;8, I think it makes more sense to infer the opposite.


Consider reckless endangerment statutes.  In Hawaii, for instance, it is &#x93;reckless endangering in the second degree&#x94; either to &#x93;recklessly plac[e] another person in danger of death or serious bodily injury,&#x94; Haw. Rev. Stat. &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(a) (2009 Cum. Supp.), or to &#x93;[i]ntentionally discharg[e] a firearm in a populated area,&#x94; &#xA7;707&#x96;714(1)(b).  I would infer that discharging the firearm is deemed dangerous enough per se that the statute does not require the State to prove danger in any given case.  Other States have similar statutes.  See, e.g., Del. Code Ann., Tit. 11, &#xA7;&#xA7;603(a)(1), (2) (2007); Wyo. Stat. Ann. &#xA7;&#xA7;6&#x96;2&#x96;504(a), (b) (2009); Me. Rev. Stat. Ann., Tit. 17&#x96;A, &#xA7;&#xA7;301(1)(B)(1), (2) (Supp. 2010).


Similarly here, I infer that &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A)&#x92;s upgrade of intentional flight to a class D felony based on the use of a vehicle alone indicates that the offense inherently qualifies as, or approximates, &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle in a manner that creates a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person&#x94; under &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).


Justice Kagan argues that if my reading were correct, the Indiana Legislature would have removed the reference to vehicular flight from &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) when it added &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A).  Post, at 12.  There are at least two problems with this reasoning.  First, even though &#xA7;3(b)(1)(A) may be redundant with &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) as to the vehicular flight offenses in subsection (a)(3), the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B) is still independently useful for the offenses in subsections (a)(1) and (2).  Thus, it is hardly strange for the legislature to have left the reference to &#x93;operat[ing] a vehicle&#x94; in &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B).  Second, although Justice Kagan can envision a more perfectly drafted statute, we do not require perfection in statutory drafting.  See, e.g., Bruesewitz v. Wyeth LLC, 562 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).  I think it clear enough what the statute means.

						 For that matter, each provision also could be satisfied by a flight that did not satisfy &#xA7;3(b)(1)(B), which casts further doubt on Justice Kagan&#x92;s vision of the statutory scheme as a unified structure of neatly progressing offenses with corresponding risk levels and punishments.  See post, at 7.

				As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar-ification of the Delphic residual clause, today&#x92;s opinion produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further confusion.  Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.  Four times is enough.  We should admit that ACCA&#x92;s residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void for vagueness.  See

				ACCA defines &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; in relevant part, as &#x93;any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year &#x2026; that &#x2026; is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

Many years of prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this definition.  A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence and the possibility of life imprisonment.  See &#xA7;924(e)(1); see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harrison
				</em>
				, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009).  Without those prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence, which could not possibly exceed 10 years.  See &#xA7;924(a)(2).

				Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within ACCA&#x92;s residual clause; that is, if it &#x93;involves conduct

				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Today&#x92;s opinion says, or initially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of risk &#x93; &#x91;comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x92; &#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 6.  That is a quotation from the Court&#x92;s opinion in the first of our
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				residual-clause trilogy, 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				, 550 U. S., at 203.  I did not join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was the closest analog.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 230 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  The problem with applying the 
				<em>

				 standard to the pres-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				ent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under Indiana law are not analogous to 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 of the four enumerated offenses.  See Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 (2004).  Nor is it apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely resembles, for example, statutory rape, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Daye
				</em>
				, 571 F. 3d 225, 228&#x96;236 (CA2 2009); possession of a sawed-off shotgun, see

				</em>
				dissent.  See 550 U. S., at 215.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But as it turns out, the Court&#x92;s inability to identify an analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present case.  For today&#x92;s opinion introduces the 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				standard with the words &#x93;[f]or instance,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  It is (according to the Court) merely 
				<em>
					one example
				</em>
				 of how the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explosives) &#x93;provide guidance.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  And the opinion then proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least-risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				&#x97;finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both arson and burglary.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6&#x96;9.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But what about the test that determined the outcome in our second case in this &#x93;series&#x94;&#x97;the &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test of 
				<em>
					Begay?
				</em>
				  Fear not.  That incompatible variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in today&#x92;s tutti-frutti opinion.  &#x93;In many cases,&#x94; we are told, it &#x93;will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  That seems to be the case here&#x97;though why, and when it will 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				be the case, are not entirely clear.  The Court&#x92;s accusation that Sykes &#x93;overreads the opinions of this Court,&#x94; 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 10, apparently applies to his interpretation of 
				<em>

				&#x92;s &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test, which the Court now suggests applies only &#x93;to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes,&#x94;  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But that makes no sense.  If the test excluded only those unintentional crimes, it would be recast as the &#x93;purposeful&#x94; test, since the last two adjectives (&#x93;violent, and aggressive&#x94;) would do no work.  For that reason, perhaps, all 11 Circuits that have addressed

				The only case that is not brought forward in today&#x92;s opinion to represent yet another test is the third and most recent in the trilogy,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/555/122" class="subref" title="subref">555 U.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				was not a crime of violence under ACCA.  But today&#x92;s opinion does cite 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				for another point: Whereas

				rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be-cause, among other reasons, no &#x93;hard statistics&#x94; on risk-iness &#x93;have been called to our attention,&#x94; 550 U. S., at

				made no mention of statistics; 
				<em>

				explained (as today&#x92;s opinion points out) that &#x93;statistical evidence sometimes &#x91;helps provide a conclusive &#x2026; answer&#x92; concerning the risks that crimes present,&#x94; 
				<em>

				</em>
				, at 8 (quoting 
				<em>

				, at 129).  Today&#x92;s opinion then outdoes

				Supreme Court briefs are an inappropriate place to develop the key facts in a case.  We normally give parties more robust protection, leaving important factual questions to district courts and juries aided by expert witnesses and the procedural protections of discovery.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid. 702&#x96;703, 705.  An adversarial process in the trial courts can identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that the parties put forward; here, we accept the studies&#x92; findings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.  The Court does not examine, for example, whether the police-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative sample of all vehicular flights.  The data may be skewed towards the rare and riskier forms of flight.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 6, n. 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kagan
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  We also have no way of knowing how many injuries reported in that data would have occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was driving recklessly even before the police gave chase.  Similar questions undermine confidence in the burglary and arson data the Court cites.  For example, the Court relies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude that 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 9.  But a 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration suggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons.  See Arson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research Series, No. 8, pp. 1&#x96;2 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at http: / / www.usfa.dhs.gov / downloads / pdf / tfrs / v1i8-508.pdf (as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  The Court does not reveal why it chose one dataset over another.  In sum, our statistical analysis in ACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading as statutory interpretation.  Most of the statistics on which the Court relies today come from government-funded studies, and did not make an appearance in this litigation until the Government&#x92;s merits brief to this Court.  See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 128&#x96;129 (demonstrating that the same was true in that case).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But the more fundamental problem with the Court&#x92;s use of statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of the residual clause, it increases the vagueness.  Vagueness, of course, must be measured 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				&#x97;
				<em>
					before 
				</em>
				the Court gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision, not 
				<em>

				Nothing is vague once the Court decrees precisely what it means.  And is it seriously to be expected that the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry statistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that this-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury than what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be believed) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extortion, or use of explosives?  To ask the question is to answer it.  A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.

The reality is that the phrase &#x93;otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x94; does not clearly define the crimes that will subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA penalties.  It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity which the text itself does not honestly contain.

				The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be unconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibitions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant&#x92;s conduct.  See

				We face a Congress that puts forth an ever-increasing volume of laws in general, and of criminal laws in particular.  It should be no surprise that as the volume increases, so do the number of imprecise laws.  And no surprise that our indulgence of imprecisions that violate the Consti-tution encourages imprecisions that violate the Constitution.  Fuzzy, leave-the-details-to-be-sorted-out-by-the-courts legislation is attractive to the Congressman who wants credit for addressing a national problem but does not have the time (or perhaps the votes) to grapple with the nitty-gritty.  In the field of criminal law, at least, it is time to call a halt.  I do not think it would be a radical step&#x97;indeed, I think it would be highly responsible&#x97;to limit ACCA to the named violent crimes.  Congress can quickly add what it wishes.  Because the majority prefers to let vagueness reign, I respectfully dissent.

				As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar-ification of the Delphic residual clause, today&#x92;s opinion produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further confusion.  Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.  Four times is enough.  We should admit that ACCA&#x92;s residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void for vagueness.  See

				ACCA defines &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; in relevant part, as &#x93;any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year &#x2026; that &#x2026; is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

Many years of prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this definition.  A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence and the possibility of life imprisonment.  See &#xA7;924(e)(1); see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harrison
				</em>
				, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009).  Without those prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence, which could not possibly exceed 10 years.  See &#xA7;924(a)(2).

				Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within ACCA&#x92;s residual clause; that is, if it &#x93;involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Today&#x92;s opinion says, or initially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of risk &#x93; &#x91;comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x92; &#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  That is a quotation from the Court&#x92;s opinion in the first of our
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				residual-clause trilogy, 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				, 550 U. S., at 203.  I did not join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was the closest analog.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 230 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  The problem with applying the 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				 standard to the pres-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				ent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under Indiana law are not analogous to 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 of the four enumerated offenses.  See Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 (2004).  Nor is it apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely resembles, for example, statutory rape, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Daye
				</em>
				, 571 F. 3d 225, 228&#x96;236 (CA2 2009); possession of a sawed-off shotgun, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton

				, 512 F. 3d 394, 403&#x96;405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison, see 
				<em>
					Chambers,
				</em>
            <em>

				</em>
				.  I predicted this inadequacy of the &#x93;closest analog&#x94; test in my 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				dissent.  See 550 U. S., at 215.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But as it turns out, the Court&#x92;s inability to identify an analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present case.  For today&#x92;s opinion introduces the 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				standard with the words &#x93;[f]or instance,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  It is (according to the Court) merely 
				<em>
					one example
				</em>
				 of how the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explosives) &#x93;provide guidance.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  And the opinion then proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least-risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				&#x97;finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both arson and burglary.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6&#x96;9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But what about the test that determined the outcome in our second case in this &#x93;series&#x94;&#x97;the &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test of 
				<em>
					Begay?
				</em>
				  Fear not.  That incompatible variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in today&#x92;s tutti-frutti opinion.  &#x93;In many cases,&#x94; we are told, it &#x93;will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  That seems to be the case here&#x97;though why, and when it will 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				be the case, are not entirely clear.  The Court&#x92;s accusation that Sykes &#x93;overreads the opinions of this Court,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, apparently applies to his interpretation of 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test, which the Court now suggests applies only &#x93;to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes,&#x94;  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But that makes no sense.  If the test excluded only those unintentional crimes, it would be recast as the &#x93;purposeful&#x94; test, since the last two adjectives (&#x93;violent, and aggressive&#x94;) would do no work.  For that reason, perhaps, all 11 Circuits that have addressed 
				<em>
					Begay

				 &#x93;overrea[d]&#x94; it just as Sykes does

				The only case that is not brought forward in today&#x92;s opinion to represent yet another test is the third and most recent in the trilogy, 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/555/122" class="subref" title="subref">555 U.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				was not a crime of violence under ACCA.  But today&#x92;s opinion does cite 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				for another point: Whereas 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be-cause, among other reasons, no &#x93;hard statistics&#x94; on risk-iness &#x93;have been called to our attention,&#x94; 550 U. S., at
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				210; and whereas 
				<em>
					Begay 
				</em>
				made no mention of statistics; 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				explained (as today&#x92;s opinion points out) that &#x93;statistical evidence sometimes &#x91;helps provide a conclusive &#x2026; answer&#x92; concerning the risks that crimes present,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (quoting 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 129).  Today&#x92;s opinion then outdoes 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				in the volume of statistics that it spews forth&#x97;statistics compiled by the International Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries attributable to police pursuits, 
				<em>

				Supreme Court briefs are an inappropriate place to develop the key facts in a case.  We normally give parties more robust protection, leaving important factual questions to district courts and juries aided by expert witnesses and the procedural protections of discovery.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid. 702&#x96;703, 705.  An adversarial process in the trial courts can identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that the parties put forward; here, we accept the studies&#x92; findings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.  The Court does not examine, for example, whether the police-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative sample of all vehicular flights.  The data may be skewed towards the rare and riskier forms of flight.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 6, n. 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kagan
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  We also have no way of knowing how many injuries reported in that data would have occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was driving recklessly even before the police gave chase.  Similar questions undermine confidence in the burglary and arson data the Court cites.  For example, the Court relies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude that 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 9.  But a 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration suggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons.  See Arson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research Series, No. 8, pp. 1&#x96;2 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at http: / / www.usfa.dhs.gov / downloads / pdf / tfrs / v1i8-508.pdf (as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  The Court does not reveal why it chose one dataset over another.  In sum, our statistical analysis in ACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading as statutory interpretation.  Most of the statistics on which the Court relies today come from government-funded studies, and did not make an appearance in this litigation until the Government&#x92;s merits brief to this Court.  See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 128&#x96;129 (demonstrating that the same was true in that case).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But the more fundamental problem with the Court&#x92;s use of statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of the residual clause, it increases the vagueness.  Vagueness, of course, must be measured 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				&#x97;
				<em>
					before 
				</em>
				the Court gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision, not 
				<em>
					after.  
				</em>
				Nothing is vague once the Court decrees precisely what it means.  And is it seriously to be expected that the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry statistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that this-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury than what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be believed) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extortion, or use of explosives?  To ask the question is to answer it.  A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.

The reality is that the phrase &#x93;otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x94; does not clearly define the crimes that will subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA penalties.  It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity which the text itself does not honestly contain.

				The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be unconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibitions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant&#x92;s conduct.  See

				 &#x93;None of the provisions the Court cites &#x2026; is similar in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical injury with the word &#x91;otherwise,&#x92; preceded by four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to the supposedly defining characteristic.

				We face a Congress that puts forth an ever-increasing volume of laws in general, and of criminal laws in particular.  It should be no surprise that as the volume increases, so do the number of imprecise laws.  And no surprise that our indulgence of imprecisions that violate the Consti-tution encourages imprecisions that violate the Constitution.  Fuzzy, leave-the-details-to-be-sorted-out-by-the-courts legislation is attractive to the Congressman who wants credit for addressing a national problem but does not have the time (or perhaps the votes) to grapple with the nitty-gritty.  In the field of criminal law, at least, it is time to call a halt.  I do not think it would be a radical step&#x97;indeed, I think it would be highly responsible&#x97;to limit ACCA to the named violent crimes.  Congress can quickly add what it wishes.  Because the majority prefers to let vagueness reign, I respectfully dissent.

				As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar-ification of the Delphic residual clause, today&#x92;s opinion produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further confusion.  Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.  Four times is enough.  We should admit that ACCA&#x92;s residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void for vagueness.  See

				ACCA defines &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; in relevant part, as &#x93;any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year &#x2026; that &#x2026; is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

Many years of prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this definition.  A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence and the possibility of life imprisonment.  See &#xA7;924(e)(1); see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harrison
				</em>
				, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009).  Without those prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence, which could not possibly exceed 10 years.  See &#xA7;924(a)(2).

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within ACCA&#x92;s residual clause; that is, if it &#x93;involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Today&#x92;s opinion says, or initially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of risk &#x93; &#x91;comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x92; &#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  That is a quotation from the Court&#x92;s opinion in the first of our
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				residual-clause trilogy, 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				, 550 U. S., at 203.  I did not join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was the closest analog.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 230 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  The problem with applying the 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				 standard to the pres-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				ent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under Indiana law are not analogous to 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 of the four enumerated offenses.  See Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 (2004).  Nor is it apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely resembles, for example, statutory rape, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Daye
				</em>
				, 571 F. 3d 225, 228&#x96;236 (CA2 2009); possession of a sawed-off shotgun, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton
				</em>
				, 512 F. 3d 394, 403&#x96;405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison, see 
				<em>
					Chambers,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				.  I predicted this inadequacy of the &#x93;closest analog&#x94; test in my 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				dissent.  See 550 U. S., at 215.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But as it turns out, the Court&#x92;s inability to identify an analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present case.  For today&#x92;s opinion introduces the 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				standard with the words &#x93;[f]or instance,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  It is (according to the Court) merely 
				<em>
					one example
				</em>
				 of how the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explosives) &#x93;provide guidance.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  And the opinion then proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least-risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				&#x97;finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both arson and burglary.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6&#x96;9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But what about the test that determined the outcome in our second case in this &#x93;series&#x94;&#x97;the &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test of 
				<em>
					Begay?
				</em>
				  Fear not.  That incompatible variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in today&#x92;s tutti-frutti opinion.  &#x93;In many cases,&#x94; we are told, it &#x93;will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  That seems to be the case here&#x97;though why, and when it will 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				be the case, are not entirely clear.  The Court&#x92;s accusation that Sykes &#x93;overreads the opinions of this Court,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, apparently applies to his interpretation of 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test, which the Court now suggests applies only &#x93;to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes,&#x94;  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But that makes no sense.  If the test excluded only those unintentional crimes, it would be recast as the &#x93;purposeful&#x94; test, since the last two adjectives (&#x93;violent, and aggressive&#x94;) would do no work.  For that reason, perhaps, all 11 Circuits that have addressed 
				<em>
					Begay

				 &#x93;overrea[d]&#x94; it just as Sykes does

				The only case that is not brought forward in today&#x92;s opinion to represent yet another test is the third and most recent in the trilogy, 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/555/122" class="subref" title="subref">555 U.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				was not a crime of violence under ACCA.  But today&#x92;s opinion does cite 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				for another point: Whereas 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be-cause, among other reasons, no &#x93;hard statistics&#x94; on risk-iness &#x93;have been called to our attention,&#x94; 550 U. S., at
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				210; and whereas 
				<em>
					Begay 
				</em>
				made no mention of statistics; 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				explained (as today&#x92;s opinion points out) that &#x93;statistical evidence sometimes &#x91;helps provide a conclusive &#x2026; answer&#x92; concerning the risks that crimes present,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (quoting 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 129).  Today&#x92;s opinion then outdoes 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				in the volume of statistics that it spews forth&#x97;statistics compiled by the International Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries attributable to police pursuits, 
				<em>

				<em>

				Supreme Court briefs are an inappropriate place to develop the key facts in a case.  We normally give parties more robust protection, leaving important factual questions to district courts and juries aided by expert witnesses and the procedural protections of discovery.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid. 702&#x96;703, 705.  An adversarial process in the trial courts can identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that the parties put forward; here, we accept the studies&#x92; findings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.  The Court does not examine, for example, whether the police-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative sample of all vehicular flights.  The data may be skewed towards the rare and riskier forms of flight.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 6, n. 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kagan
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  We also have no way of knowing how many injuries reported in that data would have occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was driving recklessly even before the police gave chase.  Similar questions undermine confidence in the burglary and arson data the Court cites.  For example, the Court relies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude that 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 9.  But a 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration suggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons.  See Arson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research Series, No. 8, pp. 1&#x96;2 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at http: / / www.usfa.dhs.gov / downloads / pdf / tfrs / v1i8-508.pdf (as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  The Court does not reveal why it chose one dataset over another.  In sum, our statistical analysis in ACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading as statutory interpretation.  Most of the statistics on which the Court relies today come from government-funded studies, and did not make an appearance in this litigation until the Government&#x92;s merits brief to this Court.  See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 128&#x96;129 (demonstrating that the same was true in that case).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But the more fundamental problem with the Court&#x92;s use of statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of the residual clause, it increases the vagueness.  Vagueness, of course, must be measured 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				&#x97;
				<em>
					before 
				</em>
				the Court gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision, not 
				<em>
					after.  
				</em>
				Nothing is vague once the Court decrees precisely what it means.  And is it seriously to be expected that the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry statistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that this-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury than what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be believed) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extortion, or use of explosives?  To ask the question is to answer it.  A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.

					Kolender
				</em>
				, 461 U. S., at 357.  The Court&#x92;s ever-evolving interpretation of the residual clause will keep defendants and judges guessing for years to come.  The reality is that the phrase &#x93;otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x94; does not clearly define the crimes that will subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA penalties.  It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity which the text itself does not honestly contain.  And even if that were our job, the further reality is that we have by now demonstrated our inability to accomplish the task.

				We have, I recognize, upheld hopelessly vague criminal statutes in the past&#x97;indeed, in the recent past.  See,

What sets ACCA apart from those statutes&#x97;and what confirms its incurable vagueness&#x97;is our repeated inability to craft a principled test out of the statutory text.  We have demonstrated by our opinions that the clause is too vague to yield &#x93;an intelligible principle,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante

				We face a Congress that puts forth an ever-increasing volume of laws in general, and of criminal laws in particular.  It should be no surprise that as the volume increases, so do the number of imprecise laws.  And no surprise that our indulgence of imprecisions that violate the Consti-tution encourages imprecisions that violate the Constitution.  Fuzzy, leave-the-details-to-be-sorted-out-by-the-courts legislation is attractive to the Congressman who wants credit for addressing a national problem but does not have the time (or perhaps the votes) to grapple with the nitty-gritty.  In the field of criminal law, at least, it is time to call a halt.  I do not think it would be a radical step&#x97;indeed, I think it would be highly responsible&#x97;to limit ACCA to the named violent crimes.  Congress can quickly add what it wishes.  Because the majority prefers to let vagueness reign, I respectfully dissent.

				As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar-ification of the Delphic residual clause, today&#x92;s opinion produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further confusion.  Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.  Four times is enough.  We should admit that ACCA&#x92;s residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void for vagueness.  See

				ACCA defines &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; in relevant part, as &#x93;any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year &#x2026; that &#x2026; is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

Many years of prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this definition.  A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence and the possibility of life imprisonment.  See &#xA7;924(e)(1); see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harrison
				</em>
				, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009).  Without those prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence, which could not possibly exceed 10 years.  See &#xA7;924(a)(2).

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within ACCA&#x92;s residual clause; that is, if it &#x93;involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Today&#x92;s opinion says, or initially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of risk &#x93; &#x91;comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x92; &#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  That is a quotation from the Court&#x92;s opinion in the first of our
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				residual-clause trilogy, 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				, 550 U. S., at 203.  I did not join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was the closest analog.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 230 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  The problem with applying the 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				 standard to the pres-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				ent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under Indiana law are not analogous to 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 of the four enumerated offenses.  See Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 (2004).  Nor is it apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely resembles, for example, statutory rape, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Daye
				</em>
				, 571 F. 3d 225, 228&#x96;236 (CA2 2009); possession of a sawed-off shotgun, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton
				</em>
				, 512 F. 3d 394, 403&#x96;405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison, see 
				<em>
					Chambers,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				.  I predicted this inadequacy of the &#x93;closest analog&#x94; test in my 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				dissent.  See 550 U. S., at 215.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But as it turns out, the Court&#x92;s inability to identify an analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present case.  For today&#x92;s opinion introduces the 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				standard with the words &#x93;[f]or instance,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  It is (according to the Court) merely 
				<em>
					one example
				</em>
				 of how the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explosives) &#x93;provide guidance.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  And the opinion then proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least-risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				&#x97;finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both arson and burglary.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6&#x96;9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But what about the test that determined the outcome in our second case in this &#x93;series&#x94;&#x97;the &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test of 
				<em>
					Begay?
				</em>
				  Fear not.  That incompatible variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in today&#x92;s tutti-frutti opinion.  &#x93;In many cases,&#x94; we are told, it &#x93;will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  That seems to be the case here&#x97;though why, and when it will 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				be the case, are not entirely clear.  The Court&#x92;s accusation that Sykes &#x93;overreads the opinions of this Court,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, apparently applies to his interpretation of 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test, which the Court now suggests applies only &#x93;to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes,&#x94;  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But that makes no sense.  If the test excluded only those unintentional crimes, it would be recast as the &#x93;purposeful&#x94; test, since the last two adjectives (&#x93;violent, and aggressive&#x94;) would do no work.  For that reason, perhaps, all 11 Circuits that have addressed 
				<em>
					Begay

				 &#x93;overrea[d]&#x94; it just as Sykes does

				The only case that is not brought forward in today&#x92;s opinion to represent yet another test is the third and most recent in the trilogy, 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/555/122" class="subref" title="subref">555 U.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				was not a crime of violence under ACCA.  But today&#x92;s opinion does cite 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				for another point: Whereas 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be-cause, among other reasons, no &#x93;hard statistics&#x94; on risk-iness &#x93;have been called to our attention,&#x94; 550 U. S., at
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				210; and whereas 
				<em>
					Begay 
				</em>
				made no mention of statistics; 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				explained (as today&#x92;s opinion points out) that &#x93;statistical evidence sometimes &#x91;helps provide a conclusive &#x2026; answer&#x92; concerning the risks that crimes present,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (quoting 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 129).  Today&#x92;s opinion then outdoes 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				in the volume of statistics that it spews forth&#x97;statistics compiled by the International Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries attributable to police pursuits, 
				<em>

				<em>

				<span class="smallcaps">

				Supreme Court briefs are an inappropriate place to develop the key facts in a case.  We normally give parties more robust protection, leaving important factual questions to district courts and juries aided by expert witnesses and the procedural protections of discovery.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid. 702&#x96;703, 705.  An adversarial process in the trial courts can identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that the parties put forward; here, we accept the studies&#x92; findings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.  The Court does not examine, for example, whether the police-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative sample of all vehicular flights.  The data may be skewed towards the rare and riskier forms of flight.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 6, n. 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kagan
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  We also have no way of knowing how many injuries reported in that data would have occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was driving recklessly even before the police gave chase.  Similar questions undermine confidence in the burglary and arson data the Court cites.  For example, the Court relies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude that 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 9.  But a 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration suggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons.  See Arson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research Series, No. 8, pp. 1&#x96;2 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at http: / / www.usfa.dhs.gov / downloads / pdf / tfrs / v1i8-508.pdf (as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  The Court does not reveal why it chose one dataset over another.  In sum, our statistical analysis in ACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading as statutory interpretation.  Most of the statistics on which the Court relies today come from government-funded studies, and did not make an appearance in this litigation until the Government&#x92;s merits brief to this Court.  See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 128&#x96;129 (demonstrating that the same was true in that case).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But the more fundamental problem with the Court&#x92;s use of statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of the residual clause, it increases the vagueness.  Vagueness, of course, must be measured 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				&#x97;
				<em>
					before 
				</em>
				the Court gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision, not 
				<em>
					after.  
				</em>
				Nothing is vague once the Court decrees precisely what it means.  And is it seriously to be expected that the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry statistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that this-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury than what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be believed) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extortion, or use of explosives?  To ask the question is to answer it.  A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.

				&#x93;They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtually all predicate offenses, &#x2026; ; (2) apply it case by case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the particular reviewing panel) believes there is a &#x91;serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x92; (whatever that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of interpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness &#x2026; .&#x94; 550 U.

				That does not violate the Constitution.  What does vio-late the Constitution is approving the enforcement of a sentencing statute that does not &#x93;give a person of ordinarily intelligence fair notice&#x94; of its reach,

				<em>
					Kolender
				</em>
				, 461 U. S., at 357.  The Court&#x92;s ever-evolving interpretation of the residual clause will keep defendants and judges guessing for years to come.  The reality is that the phrase &#x93;otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x94; does not clearly define the crimes that will subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA penalties.  It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity which the text itself does not honestly contain.  And even if that were our job, the further reality is that we have by now demonstrated our inability to accomplish the task.

				We have, I recognize, upheld hopelessly vague criminal statutes in the past&#x97;indeed, in the recent past.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>

				, at ___ (

What sets ACCA apart from those statutes&#x97;and what confirms its incurable vagueness&#x97;is our repeated inability to craft a principled test out of the statutory text.  We have demonstrated by our opinions that the clause is too vague to yield &#x93;an intelligible principle,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 13, each attempt to ignore that reality producing a new regime that is less predictable and more arbitrary than the last.  ACCA&#x92;s residual clause fails to speak with the clarity that criminal proscriptions require.  See

				The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be unconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibitions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant&#x92;s conduct.  See

				We face a Congress that puts forth an ever-increasing volume of laws in general, and of criminal laws in particular.  It should be no surprise that as the volume increases, so do the number of imprecise laws.  And no surprise that our indulgence of imprecisions that violate the Consti-tution encourages imprecisions that violate the Constitution.  Fuzzy, leave-the-details-to-be-sorted-out-by-the-courts legislation is attractive to the Congressman who wants credit for addressing a national problem but does not have the time (or perhaps the votes) to grapple with the nitty-gritty.  In the field of criminal law, at least, it is time to call a halt.  I do not think it would be a radical step&#x97;indeed, I think it would be highly responsible&#x97;to limit ACCA to the named violent crimes.  Congress can quickly add what it wishes.  Because the majority prefers to let vagueness reign, I respectfully dissent.

				As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar-ification of the Delphic residual clause, today&#x92;s opinion produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further confusion.  Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.  Four times is enough.  We should admit that ACCA&#x92;s residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void for vagueness.  See

				ACCA defines &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; in relevant part, as &#x93;any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year &#x2026; that &#x2026; is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/924.html#e_2_B_ii" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii)</a>.  Many years of prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this definition.  A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence and the possibility of life imprisonment.  See &#xA7;924(e)(1); see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harrison
				</em>
				, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009).  Without those prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence, which could not possibly exceed 10 years.  See &#xA7;924(a)(2).

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within ACCA&#x92;s residual clause; that is, if it &#x93;involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Today&#x92;s opinion says, or initially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of risk &#x93; &#x91;comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x92; &#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  That is a quotation from the Court&#x92;s opinion in the first of our
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				residual-clause trilogy, 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				, 550 U. S., at 203.  I did not join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was the closest analog.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 230 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  The problem with applying the 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				 standard to the pres-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				ent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under Indiana law are not analogous to 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 of the four enumerated offenses.  See Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 (2004).  Nor is it apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely resembles, for example, statutory rape, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Daye
				</em>
				, 571 F. 3d 225, 228&#x96;236 (CA2 2009); possession of a sawed-off shotgun, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton
				</em>
				, 512 F. 3d 394, 403&#x96;405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison, see 
				<em>
					Chambers,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				.  I predicted this inadequacy of the &#x93;closest analog&#x94; test in my 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				dissent.  See 550 U. S., at 215.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But as it turns out, the Court&#x92;s inability to identify an analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present case.  For today&#x92;s opinion introduces the 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				standard with the words &#x93;[f]or instance,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  It is (according to the Court) merely 
				<em>
					one example
				</em>
				 of how the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explosives) &#x93;provide guidance.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  And the opinion then proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least-risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				&#x97;finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both arson and burglary.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6&#x96;9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But what about the test that determined the outcome in our second case in this &#x93;series&#x94;&#x97;the &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test of 
				<em>
					Begay?
				</em>
				  Fear not.  That incompatible variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in today&#x92;s tutti-frutti opinion.  &#x93;In many cases,&#x94; we are told, it &#x93;will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  That seems to be the case here&#x97;though why, and when it will 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				be the case, are not entirely clear.  The Court&#x92;s accusation that Sykes &#x93;overreads the opinions of this Court,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, apparently applies to his interpretation of 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test, which the Court now suggests applies only &#x93;to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes,&#x94;  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But that makes no sense.  If the test excluded only those unintentional crimes, it would be recast as the &#x93;purposeful&#x94; test, since the last two adjectives (&#x93;violent, and aggressive&#x94;) would do no work.  For that reason, perhaps, all 11 Circuits that have addressed 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				 &#x93;overrea[d]&#x94; it just as Sykes does

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The only case that is not brought forward in today&#x92;s opinion to represent yet another test is the third and most recent in the trilogy, 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/555/122" class="subref" title="subref">555 U.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				was not a crime of violence under ACCA.  But today&#x92;s opinion does cite 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				for another point: Whereas 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be-cause, among other reasons, no &#x93;hard statistics&#x94; on risk-iness &#x93;have been called to our attention,&#x94; 550 U. S., at
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				210; and whereas 
				<em>
					Begay 
				</em>
				made no mention of statistics; 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				explained (as today&#x92;s opinion points out) that &#x93;statistical evidence sometimes &#x91;helps provide a conclusive &#x2026; answer&#x92; concerning the risks that crimes present,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (quoting 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 129).  Today&#x92;s opinion then outdoes 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				in the volume of statistics that it spews forth&#x97;statistics compiled by the International Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries attributable to police pursuits, 
				<em>

				<em>

				<em>

				<span class="smallcaps">

				Supreme Court briefs are an inappropriate place to develop the key facts in a case.  We normally give parties more robust protection, leaving important factual questions to district courts and juries aided by expert witnesses and the procedural protections of discovery.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid. 702&#x96;703, 705.  An adversarial process in the trial courts can identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that the parties put forward; here, we accept the studies&#x92; findings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.  The Court does not examine, for example, whether the police-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative sample of all vehicular flights.  The data may be skewed towards the rare and riskier forms of flight.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 6, n. 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kagan
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  We also have no way of knowing how many injuries reported in that data would have occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was driving recklessly even before the police gave chase.  Similar questions undermine confidence in the burglary and arson data the Court cites.  For example, the Court relies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude that 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 9.  But a 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration suggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons.  See Arson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research Series, No. 8, pp. 1&#x96;2 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at http: / / www.usfa.dhs.gov / downloads / pdf / tfrs / v1i8-508.pdf (as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  The Court does not reveal why it chose one dataset over another.  In sum, our statistical analysis in ACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading as statutory interpretation.  Most of the statistics on which the Court relies today come from government-funded studies, and did not make an appearance in this litigation until the Government&#x92;s merits brief to this Court.  See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 128&#x96;129 (demonstrating that the same was true in that case).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But the more fundamental problem with the Court&#x92;s use of statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of the residual clause, it increases the vagueness.  Vagueness, of course, must be measured 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				&#x97;
				<em>
					before 
				</em>
				the Court gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision, not 
				<em>
					after.  
				</em>
				Nothing is vague once the Court decrees precisely what it means.  And is it seriously to be expected that the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry statistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that this-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury than what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be believed) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extortion, or use of explosives?  To ask the question is to answer it.  A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.

				When I dissented from the Court&#x92;s judgment in

				&#x93;They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtually all predicate offenses, &#x2026; ; (2) apply it case by case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the particular reviewing panel) believes there is a &#x91;serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x92; (whatever that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of interpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness &#x2026; .&#x94; 550 U.

				That does not violate the Constitution.  What does vio-late the Constitution is approving the enforcement of a sentencing statute that does not &#x93;give a person of ordinarily intelligence fair notice&#x94; of its reach,

				<em>
					Kolender
				</em>
				, 461 U. S., at 357.  The Court&#x92;s ever-evolving interpretation of the residual clause will keep defendants and judges guessing for years to come.  The reality is that the phrase &#x93;otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x94; does not clearly define the crimes that will subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA penalties.  It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity which the text itself does not honestly contain.  And even if that were our job, the further reality is that we have by now demonstrated our inability to accomplish the task.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We have, I recognize, upheld hopelessly vague criminal statutes in the past&#x97;indeed, in the recent past.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Skilling

				 v.

				</em>
				, at ___ (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia, J.,
				</span>
				 concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).  What sets ACCA apart from those statutes&#x97;and what confirms its incurable vagueness&#x97;is our repeated inability to craft a principled test out of the statutory text.  We have demonstrated by our opinions that the clause is too vague to yield &#x93;an intelligible principle,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 13, each attempt to ignore that reality producing a new regime that is less predictable and more arbitrary than the last.  ACCA&#x92;s residual clause fails to speak with the clarity that criminal proscriptions require.  See

				 v.

				The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be unconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibitions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant&#x92;s conduct.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  Even apart from the fact that our opinions dealing with those statutes have not displayed the confusion evident in our four ACCA efforts,

        <p class="bodytext">
				 &#x93;None of the provisions the Court cites &#x2026; is similar in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical injury with the word &#x91;otherwise,&#x92; preceded by four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to the supposedly defining characteristic. The phrase &#x91;shades of red,&#x92; standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase &#x91;fire-engine red, light pink, maroon,

Fuzzy, leave-the-details-to-be-sorted-out-by-the-courts legislation is attractive to the Congressman who wants credit for addressing a national problem but does not have the time (or perhaps the votes) to grapple with the nitty-gritty.  In the field of criminal law, at least, it is time to call a halt.  I do not think it would be a radical step&#x97;indeed, I think it would be highly responsible&#x97;to limit ACCA to the named violent crimes.  Congress can quickly add what it wishes.  Because the majority prefers to let vagueness reign, I respectfully dissent.

				As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar-ification of the Delphic residual clause, today&#x92;s opinion produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further confusion.  Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.  Four times is enough.  We should admit that ACCA&#x92;s residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void for vagueness.  See

				ACCA defines &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; in relevant part, as &#x93;any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year &#x2026; that &#x2026; is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

Many years of prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this definition.  A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence and the possibility of life imprisonment.  See &#xA7;924(e)(1); see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harrison
				</em>
				, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009).  Without those prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence, which could not possibly exceed 10 years.  See &#xA7;924(a)(2).

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within ACCA&#x92;s residual clause; that is, if it &#x93;involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Today&#x92;s opinion says, or initially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of risk &#x93; &#x91;comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x92; &#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  That is a quotation from the Court&#x92;s opinion in the first of our
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				residual-clause trilogy, 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				, 550 U. S., at 203.  I did not join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was the closest analog.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 230 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  The problem with applying the 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				 standard to the pres-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				ent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under Indiana law are not analogous to 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 of the four enumerated offenses.  See Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 (2004).  Nor is it apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely resembles, for example, statutory rape, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Daye
				</em>
				, 571 F. 3d 225, 228&#x96;236 (CA2 2009); possession of a sawed-off shotgun, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton
				</em>
				, 512 F. 3d 394, 403&#x96;405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison, see 
				<em>
					Chambers,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				.  I predicted this inadequacy of the &#x93;closest analog&#x94; test in my 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				dissent.  See 550 U. S., at 215.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But as it turns out, the Court&#x92;s inability to identify an analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present case.  For today&#x92;s opinion introduces the 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				standard with the words &#x93;[f]or instance,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  It is (according to the Court) merely 
				<em>
					one example
				</em>
				 of how the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explosives) &#x93;provide guidance.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  And the opinion then proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least-risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				&#x97;finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both arson and burglary.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6&#x96;9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But what about the test that determined the outcome in our second case in this &#x93;series&#x94;&#x97;the &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test of 
				<em>
					Begay?
				</em>
				  Fear not.  That incompatible variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in today&#x92;s tutti-frutti opinion.  &#x93;In many cases,&#x94; we are told, it &#x93;will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  That seems to be the case here&#x97;though why, and when it will 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				be the case, are not entirely clear.  The Court&#x92;s accusation that Sykes &#x93;overreads the opinions of this Court,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, apparently applies to his interpretation of 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test, which the Court now suggests applies only &#x93;to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes,&#x94;  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But that makes no sense.  If the test excluded only those unintentional crimes, it would be recast as the &#x93;purposeful&#x94; test, since the last two adjectives (&#x93;violent, and aggressive&#x94;) would do no work.  For that reason, perhaps, all 11 Circuits that have addressed 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				 &#x93;overrea[d]&#x94; it just as Sykes does

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The only case that is not brought forward in today&#x92;s opinion to represent yet another test is the third and most recent in the trilogy, 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/555/122" class="subref" title="subref">555 U.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				was not a crime of violence under ACCA.  But today&#x92;s opinion does cite 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				for another point: Whereas 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be-cause, among other reasons, no &#x93;hard statistics&#x94; on risk-iness &#x93;have been called to our attention,&#x94; 550 U. S., at
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				210; and whereas 
				<em>
					Begay 
				</em>
				made no mention of statistics; 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				explained (as today&#x92;s opinion points out) that &#x93;statistical evidence sometimes &#x91;helps provide a conclusive &#x2026; answer&#x92; concerning the risks that crimes present,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (quoting 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 129).  Today&#x92;s opinion then outdoes 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				in the volume of statistics that it spews forth&#x97;statistics compiled by the International Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries attributable to police pursuits, 
				<em>

				<em>

				<em>

				<span class="smallcaps">

				Supreme Court briefs are an inappropriate place to develop the key facts in a case.  We normally give parties more robust protection, leaving important factual questions to district courts and juries aided by expert witnesses and the procedural protections of discovery.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid. 702&#x96;703, 705.  An adversarial process in the trial courts can identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that the parties put forward; here, we accept the studies&#x92; findings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.  The Court does not examine, for example, whether the police-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative sample of all vehicular flights.  The data may be skewed towards the rare and riskier forms of flight.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 6, n. 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kagan
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  We also have no way of knowing how many injuries reported in that data would have occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was driving recklessly even before the police gave chase.  Similar questions undermine confidence in the burglary and arson data the Court cites.  For example, the Court relies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude that 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 9.  But a 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration suggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons.  See Arson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research Series, No. 8, pp. 1&#x96;2 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at http: / / www.usfa.dhs.gov / downloads / pdf / tfrs / v1i8-508.pdf (as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  The Court does not reveal why it chose one dataset over another.  In sum, our statistical analysis in ACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading as statutory interpretation.  Most of the statistics on which the Court relies today come from government-funded studies, and did not make an appearance in this litigation until the Government&#x92;s merits brief to this Court.  See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 128&#x96;129 (demonstrating that the same was true in that case).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But the more fundamental problem with the Court&#x92;s use of statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of the residual clause, it increases the vagueness.  Vagueness, of course, must be measured 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				&#x97;
				<em>
					before 
				</em>
				the Court gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision, not 
				<em>
					after.  
				</em>
				Nothing is vague once the Court decrees precisely what it means.  And is it seriously to be expected that the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry statistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that this-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury than what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be believed) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extortion, or use of explosives?  To ask the question is to answer it.  A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.

				When I dissented from the Court&#x92;s judgment in

				&#x93;They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtually all predicate offenses, &#x2026; ; (2) apply it case by case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the particular reviewing panel) believes there is a &#x91;serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x92; (whatever that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of interpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness &#x2026; .&#x94; 550 U.

				That does not violate the Constitution.  What does vio-late the Constitution is approving the enforcement of a sentencing statute that does not &#x93;give a person of ordinarily intelligence fair notice&#x94; of its reach,

 (internal quotation marks omitted), and that permits, indeed invites, arbitrary enforcement, see 
				<em>
					Kolender
				</em>
				, 461 U. S., at 357.  The Court&#x92;s ever-evolving interpretation of the residual clause will keep defendants and judges guessing for years to come.  The reality is that the phrase &#x93;otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x94; does not clearly define the crimes that will subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA penalties.  It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity which the text itself does not honestly contain.  And even if that were our job, the further reality is that we have by now demonstrated our inability to accomplish the task.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We have, I recognize, upheld hopelessly vague criminal statutes in the past&#x97;indeed, in the recent past.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Skilling

				 v.

				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at ___ (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia, J.,
				</span>
				 concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).  What sets ACCA apart from those statutes&#x97;and what confirms its incurable vagueness&#x97;is our repeated inability to craft a principled test out of the statutory text.  We have demonstrated by our opinions that the clause is too vague to yield &#x93;an intelligible principle,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 13, each attempt to ignore that reality producing a new regime that is less predictable and more arbitrary than the last.  ACCA&#x92;s residual clause fails to speak with the clarity that criminal proscriptions require.  See 
				<em>
					United States

				 v. 
				<em>
					L. Cohen Grocery Co.

				The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be unconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibitions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant&#x92;s conduct.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  Even apart from the fact that our opinions dealing with those statutes have not displayed the confusion evident in our four ACCA efforts,
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				this is not the first time I have found the comparison unpersuasive:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				 &#x93;None of the provisions the Court cites &#x2026; is similar in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical injury with the word &#x91;otherwise,&#x92; preceded by four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to the supposedly defining characteristic. The phrase &#x91;shades of red,&#x92; standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase &#x91;fire-engine red, light pink, maroon,

				As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar-ification of the Delphic residual clause, today&#x92;s opinion produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further confusion.  Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.  Four times is enough.  We should admit that ACCA&#x92;s residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void for vagueness.  See

				ACCA defines &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; in relevant part, as &#x93;any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year &#x2026; that &#x2026; is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/924.html#e_2_B_ii" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii)</a>.  Many years of prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this definition.  A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence and the possibility of life imprisonment.  See &#xA7;924(e)(1); see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harrison
				</em>
				, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009).  Without those prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence, which could not possibly exceed 10 years.  See &#xA7;924(a)(2).

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within ACCA&#x92;s residual clause; that is, if it &#x93;involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Today&#x92;s opinion says, or initially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of risk &#x93; &#x91;comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x92; &#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  That is a quotation from the Court&#x92;s opinion in the first of our
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				residual-clause trilogy, 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				, 550 U. S., at 203.  I did not join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was the closest analog.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 230 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  The problem with applying the 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				 standard to the pres-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				ent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under Indiana law are not analogous to 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 of the four enumerated offenses.  See Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 (2004).  Nor is it apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely resembles, for example, statutory rape, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Daye
				</em>
				, 571 F. 3d 225, 228&#x96;236 (CA2 2009); possession of a sawed-off shotgun, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton
				</em>
				, 512 F. 3d 394, 403&#x96;405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison, see 
				<em>
					Chambers,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				.  I predicted this inadequacy of the &#x93;closest analog&#x94; test in my 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				dissent.  See 550 U. S., at 215.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But as it turns out, the Court&#x92;s inability to identify an analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present case.  For today&#x92;s opinion introduces the 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				standard with the words &#x93;[f]or instance,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  It is (according to the Court) merely 
				<em>
					one example
				</em>
				 of how the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explosives) &#x93;provide guidance.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  And the opinion then proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least-risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				&#x97;finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both arson and burglary.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6&#x96;9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But what about the test that determined the outcome in our second case in this &#x93;series&#x94;&#x97;the &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test of 
				<em>
					Begay?
				</em>
				  Fear not.  That incompatible variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in today&#x92;s tutti-frutti opinion.  &#x93;In many cases,&#x94; we are told, it &#x93;will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  That seems to be the case here&#x97;though why, and when it will 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				be the case, are not entirely clear.  The Court&#x92;s accusation that Sykes &#x93;overreads the opinions of this Court,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, apparently applies to his interpretation of 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test, which the Court now suggests applies only &#x93;to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes,&#x94;  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But that makes no sense.  If the test excluded only those unintentional crimes, it would be recast as the &#x93;purposeful&#x94; test, since the last two adjectives (&#x93;violent, and aggressive&#x94;) would do no work.  For that reason, perhaps, all 11 Circuits that have addressed 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				 &#x93;overrea[d]&#x94; it just as Sykes does

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The only case that is not brought forward in today&#x92;s opinion to represent yet another test is the third and most recent in the trilogy, 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/555/122" class="subref" title="subref">555 U.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				was not a crime of violence under ACCA.  But today&#x92;s opinion does cite 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				for another point: Whereas 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be-cause, among other reasons, no &#x93;hard statistics&#x94; on risk-iness &#x93;have been called to our attention,&#x94; 550 U. S., at
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				210; and whereas 
				<em>
					Begay 
				</em>
				made no mention of statistics; 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				explained (as today&#x92;s opinion points out) that &#x93;statistical evidence sometimes &#x91;helps provide a conclusive &#x2026; answer&#x92; concerning the risks that crimes present,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (quoting 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 129).  Today&#x92;s opinion then outdoes 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				in the volume of statistics that it spews forth&#x97;statistics compiled by the International Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries attributable to police pursuits, 
				<em>

				<em>

				<em>

				, and (by reference to 
				<span class="smallcaps">

				Supreme Court briefs are an inappropriate place to develop the key facts in a case.  We normally give parties more robust protection, leaving important factual questions to district courts and juries aided by expert witnesses and the procedural protections of discovery.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid. 702&#x96;703, 705.  An adversarial process in the trial courts can identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that the parties put forward; here, we accept the studies&#x92; findings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.  The Court does not examine, for example, whether the police-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative sample of all vehicular flights.  The data may be skewed towards the rare and riskier forms of flight.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 6, n. 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kagan
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  We also have no way of knowing how many injuries reported in that data would have occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was driving recklessly even before the police gave chase.  Similar questions undermine confidence in the burglary and arson data the Court cites.  For example, the Court relies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude that 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 9.  But a 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration suggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons.  See Arson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research Series, No. 8, pp. 1&#x96;2 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at http: / / www.usfa.dhs.gov / downloads / pdf / tfrs / v1i8-508.pdf (as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  The Court does not reveal why it chose one dataset over another.  In sum, our statistical analysis in ACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading as statutory interpretation.  Most of the statistics on which the Court relies today come from government-funded studies, and did not make an appearance in this litigation until the Government&#x92;s merits brief to this Court.  See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 128&#x96;129 (demonstrating that the same was true in that case).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But the more fundamental problem with the Court&#x92;s use of statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of the residual clause, it increases the vagueness.  Vagueness, of course, must be measured 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				&#x97;
				<em>
					before 
				</em>
				the Court gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision, not 
				<em>
					after.  
				</em>
				Nothing is vague once the Court decrees precisely what it means.  And is it seriously to be expected that the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry statistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that this-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury than what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be believed) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extortion, or use of explosives?  To ask the question is to answer it.  A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.

				When I dissented from the Court&#x92;s judgment in

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtually all predicate offenses, &#x2026; ; (2) apply it case by case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the particular reviewing panel) believes there is a &#x91;serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x92; (whatever that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of interpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness &#x2026; .&#x94; 550 U.

				the third option; and the Court, I believed, had chosen the second.  &#x93;Today&#x92;s opinion,&#x94; I wrote, &#x93;permits an unintelligible crim-inal statute to survive uncorrected, unguided, and unexplained.&#x94;

				That does not violate the Constitution.  What does vio-late the Constitution is approving the enforcement of a sentencing statute that does not &#x93;give a person of ordinarily intelligence fair notice&#x94; of its reach,

 (internal quotation marks omitted), and that permits, indeed invites, arbitrary enforcement, see 
				<em>
					Kolender
				</em>
				, 461 U. S., at 357.  The Court&#x92;s ever-evolving interpretation of the residual clause will keep defendants and judges guessing for years to come.  The reality is that the phrase &#x93;otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x94; does not clearly define the crimes that will subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA penalties.  It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity which the text itself does not honestly contain.  And even if that were our job, the further reality is that we have by now demonstrated our inability to accomplish the task.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We have, I recognize, upheld hopelessly vague criminal statutes in the past&#x97;indeed, in the recent past.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Skilling
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States

				, 561 U. S. ___ (2010).  That is regrettable, see 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at ___ (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia, J.,
				</span>
				 concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).  What sets ACCA apart from those statutes&#x97;and what confirms its incurable vagueness&#x97;is our repeated inability to craft a principled test out of the statutory text.  We have demonstrated by our opinions that the clause is too vague to yield &#x93;an intelligible principle,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 13, each attempt to ignore that reality producing a new regime that is less predictable and more arbitrary than the last.  ACCA&#x92;s residual clause fails to speak with the clarity that criminal proscriptions require.  See 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					L. Cohen Grocery Co.

				The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be unconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibitions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant&#x92;s conduct.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  Even apart from the fact that our opinions dealing with those statutes have not displayed the confusion evident in our four ACCA efforts,
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				this is not the first time I have found the comparison unpersuasive:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				 &#x93;None of the provisions the Court cites &#x2026; is similar in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical injury with the word &#x91;otherwise,&#x92; preceded by four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to the supposedly defining characteristic. The phrase &#x91;shades of red,&#x92; standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase &#x91;fire-engine red, light pink, maroon, 
				<em>

				We face a Congress that puts forth an ever-increasing volume of laws in general, and of criminal laws in particular.  It should be no surprise that as the volume increases, so do the number of imprecise laws.  And no surprise that our indulgence of imprecisions that violate the Consti-tution encourages imprecisions that violate the Constitution.  Fuzzy, leave-the-details-to-be-sorted-out-by-the-courts legislation is attractive to the Congressman who wants credit for addressing a national problem but does not have the time (or perhaps the votes) to grapple with the nitty-gritty.  In the field of criminal law, at least, it is time to call a halt.  I do not think it would be a radical step&#x97;indeed, I think it would be highly responsible&#x97;to limit ACCA to the named violent crimes.  Congress can quickly add what it wishes.  Because the majority prefers to let vagueness reign, I respectfully dissent.

				As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar-ification of the Delphic residual clause, today&#x92;s opinion produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further confusion.  Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.  Four times is enough.  We should admit that ACCA&#x92;s residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void for vagueness.  See

				ACCA defines &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; in relevant part, as &#x93;any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year &#x2026; that &#x2026; is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

Many years of prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this definition.  A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence and the possibility of life imprisonment.  See &#xA7;924(e)(1); see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harrison
				</em>
				, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009).  Without those prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence, which could not possibly exceed 10 years.  See &#xA7;924(a)(2).

				Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within ACCA&#x92;s residual clause; that is, if it &#x93;involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Today&#x92;s opinion says, or initially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of risk &#x93; &#x91;comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x92; &#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  That is a quotation from the Court&#x92;s opinion in the first of our
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				residual-clause trilogy, 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				, 550 U. S., at 203.  I did not join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was the closest analog.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 230 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  The problem with applying the 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				 standard to the pres-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				ent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under Indiana law are not analogous to 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 of the four enumerated offenses.  See Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 (2004).  Nor is it apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely resembles, for example, statutory rape, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Daye
				</em>
				, 571 F. 3d 225, 228&#x96;236 (CA2 2009); possession of a sawed-off shotgun, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton

				, 512 F. 3d 394, 403&#x96;405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison, see 
				<em>
					Chambers,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				.  I predicted this inadequacy of the &#x93;closest analog&#x94; test in my 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				dissent.  See 550 U. S., at 215.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But as it turns out, the Court&#x92;s inability to identify an analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present case.  For today&#x92;s opinion introduces the 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				standard with the words &#x93;[f]or instance,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  It is (according to the Court) merely 
				<em>
					one example
				</em>
				 of how the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explosives) &#x93;provide guidance.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  And the opinion then proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least-risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				&#x97;finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both arson and burglary.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6&#x96;9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But what about the test that determined the outcome in our second case in this &#x93;series&#x94;&#x97;the &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test of 
				<em>
					Begay?
				</em>
				  Fear not.  That incompatible variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in today&#x92;s tutti-frutti opinion.  &#x93;In many cases,&#x94; we are told, it &#x93;will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  That seems to be the case here&#x97;though why, and when it will 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				be the case, are not entirely clear.  The Court&#x92;s accusation that Sykes &#x93;overreads the opinions of this Court,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, apparently applies to his interpretation of 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test, which the Court now suggests applies only &#x93;to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes,&#x94;  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But that makes no sense.  If the test excluded only those unintentional crimes, it would be recast as the &#x93;purposeful&#x94; test, since the last two adjectives (&#x93;violent, and aggressive&#x94;) would do no work.  For that reason, perhaps, all 11 Circuits that have addressed 
				<em>
					Begay

				 &#x93;overrea[d]&#x94; it just as Sykes does

				The only case that is not brought forward in today&#x92;s opinion to represent yet another test is the third and most recent in the trilogy, 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/555/122" class="subref" title="subref">555 U.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				was not a crime of violence under ACCA.  But today&#x92;s opinion does cite 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				for another point: Whereas 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be-cause, among other reasons, no &#x93;hard statistics&#x94; on risk-iness &#x93;have been called to our attention,&#x94; 550 U. S., at
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				210; and whereas 
				<em>
					Begay 
				</em>
				made no mention of statistics; 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				explained (as today&#x92;s opinion points out) that &#x93;statistical evidence sometimes &#x91;helps provide a conclusive &#x2026; answer&#x92; concerning the risks that crimes present,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (quoting 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 129).  Today&#x92;s opinion then outdoes 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				in the volume of statistics that it spews forth&#x97;statistics compiled by the International Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries attributable to police pursuits, 
				<em>

				Supreme Court briefs are an inappropriate place to develop the key facts in a case.  We normally give parties more robust protection, leaving important factual questions to district courts and juries aided by expert witnesses and the procedural protections of discovery.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid. 702&#x96;703, 705.  An adversarial process in the trial courts can identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that the parties put forward; here, we accept the studies&#x92; findings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.  The Court does not examine, for example, whether the police-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative sample of all vehicular flights.  The data may be skewed towards the rare and riskier forms of flight.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 6, n. 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kagan
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  We also have no way of knowing how many injuries reported in that data would have occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was driving recklessly even before the police gave chase.  Similar questions undermine confidence in the burglary and arson data the Court cites.  For example, the Court relies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude that 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 9.  But a 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration suggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons.  See Arson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research Series, No. 8, pp. 1&#x96;2 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at http: / / www.usfa.dhs.gov / downloads / pdf / tfrs / v1i8-508.pdf (as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  The Court does not reveal why it chose one dataset over another.  In sum, our statistical analysis in ACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading as statutory interpretation.  Most of the statistics on which the Court relies today come from government-funded studies, and did not make an appearance in this litigation until the Government&#x92;s merits brief to this Court.  See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 128&#x96;129 (demonstrating that the same was true in that case).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But the more fundamental problem with the Court&#x92;s use of statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of the residual clause, it increases the vagueness.  Vagueness, of course, must be measured 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				&#x97;
				<em>
					before 
				</em>
				the Court gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision, not 
				<em>
					after.  
				</em>
				Nothing is vague once the Court decrees precisely what it means.  And is it seriously to be expected that the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry statistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that this-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury than what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be believed) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extortion, or use of explosives?  To ask the question is to answer it.  A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.

				When I dissented from the Court&#x92;s judgment in

				&#x93;They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtually all predicate offenses, &#x2026; ; (2) apply it case by case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the particular reviewing panel) believes there is a &#x91;serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x92; (whatever that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of interpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness &#x2026; .&#x94; 550 U.

				That does not violate the Constitution.  What does vio-late the Constitution is approving the enforcement of a sentencing statute that does not &#x93;give a person of ordinarily intelligence fair notice&#x94; of its reach,

				<em>
					Kolender
				</em>
				, 461 U. S., at 357.  The Court&#x92;s ever-evolving interpretation of the residual clause will keep defendants and judges guessing for years to come.  The reality is that the phrase &#x93;otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x94; does not clearly define the crimes that will subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA penalties.  It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity which the text itself does not honestly contain.  And even if that were our job, the further reality is that we have by now demonstrated our inability to accomplish the task.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We have, I recognize, upheld hopelessly vague criminal statutes in the past&#x97;indeed, in the recent past.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Skilling

				</em>
				, at ___ (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia, J.,
				</span>
				 concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).  What sets ACCA apart from those statutes&#x97;and what confirms its incurable vagueness&#x97;is our repeated inability to craft a principled test out of the statutory text.  We have demonstrated by our opinions that the clause is too vague to yield &#x93;an intelligible principle,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 13, each attempt to ignore that reality producing a new regime that is less predictable and more arbitrary than the last.  ACCA&#x92;s residual clause fails to speak with the clarity that criminal proscriptions require.  See

				The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be unconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibitions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant&#x92;s conduct.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  Even apart from the fact that our opinions dealing with those statutes have not displayed the confusion evident in our four ACCA efforts,

				this is not the first time I have found the comparison unpersuasive:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				 &#x93;None of the provisions the Court cites &#x2026; is similar in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical injury with the word &#x91;otherwise,&#x92; preceded by four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to the supposedly defining characteristic. The phrase &#x91;shades of red,&#x92; standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase &#x91;fire-engine red, light pink, maroon,

				We face a Congress that puts forth an ever-increasing volume of laws in general, and of criminal laws in particular.  It should be no surprise that as the volume increases, so do the number of imprecise laws.  And no surprise that our indulgence of imprecisions that violate the Consti-tution encourages imprecisions that violate the Constitution.  Fuzzy, leave-the-details-to-be-sorted-out-by-the-courts legislation is attractive to the Congressman who wants credit for addressing a national problem but does not have the time (or perhaps the votes) to grapple with the nitty-gritty.  In the field of criminal law, at least, it is time to call a halt.  I do not think it would be a radical step&#x97;indeed, I think it would be highly responsible&#x97;to limit ACCA to the named violent crimes.  Congress can quickly add what it wishes.  Because the majority prefers to let vagueness reign, I respectfully dissent.

				As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar-ification of the Delphic residual clause, today&#x92;s opinion produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further confusion.  Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.  Four times is enough.  We should admit that ACCA&#x92;s residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void for vagueness.  See

				ACCA defines &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; in relevant part, as &#x93;any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year &#x2026; that &#x2026; is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

Many years of prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this definition.  A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence and the possibility of life imprisonment.  See &#xA7;924(e)(1); see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harrison
				</em>
				, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009).  Without those prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence, which could not possibly exceed 10 years.  See &#xA7;924(a)(2).

				Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within ACCA&#x92;s residual clause; that is, if it &#x93;involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Today&#x92;s opinion says, or initially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of risk &#x93; &#x91;comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x92; &#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  That is a quotation from the Court&#x92;s opinion in the first of our
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				residual-clause trilogy, 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				, 550 U. S., at 203.  I did not join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was the closest analog.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 230 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  The problem with applying the 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				 standard to the pres-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				ent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under Indiana law are not analogous to 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 of the four enumerated offenses.  See Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 (2004).  Nor is it apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely resembles, for example, statutory rape, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Daye
				</em>
				, 571 F. 3d 225, 228&#x96;236 (CA2 2009); possession of a sawed-off shotgun, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton
				</em>
				, 512 F. 3d 394, 403&#x96;405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison, see 
				<em>
					Chambers,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				.  I predicted this inadequacy of the &#x93;closest analog&#x94; test in my 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				dissent.  See 550 U. S., at 215.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But as it turns out, the Court&#x92;s inability to identify an analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present case.  For today&#x92;s opinion introduces the 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				standard with the words &#x93;[f]or instance,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  It is (according to the Court) merely 
				<em>
					one example
				</em>
				 of how the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explosives) &#x93;provide guidance.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  And the opinion then proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least-risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				&#x97;finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both arson and burglary.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6&#x96;9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But what about the test that determined the outcome in our second case in this &#x93;series&#x94;&#x97;the &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test of 
				<em>
					Begay?
				</em>
				  Fear not.  That incompatible variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in today&#x92;s tutti-frutti opinion.  &#x93;In many cases,&#x94; we are told, it &#x93;will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  That seems to be the case here&#x97;though why, and when it will 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				be the case, are not entirely clear.  The Court&#x92;s accusation that Sykes &#x93;overreads the opinions of this Court,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, apparently applies to his interpretation of 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test, which the Court now suggests applies only &#x93;to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes,&#x94;  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But that makes no sense.  If the test excluded only those unintentional crimes, it would be recast as the &#x93;purposeful&#x94; test, since the last two adjectives (&#x93;violent, and aggressive&#x94;) would do no work.  For that reason, perhaps, all 11 Circuits that have addressed 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				 &#x93;overrea[d]&#x94; it just as Sykes does

				The only case that is not brought forward in today&#x92;s opinion to represent yet another test is the third and most recent in the trilogy, 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/555/122" class="subref" title="subref">555 U.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				was not a crime of violence under ACCA.  But today&#x92;s opinion does cite 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				for another point: Whereas 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be-cause, among other reasons, no &#x93;hard statistics&#x94; on risk-iness &#x93;have been called to our attention,&#x94; 550 U. S., at
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				210; and whereas 
				<em>
					Begay 
				</em>
				made no mention of statistics; 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				explained (as today&#x92;s opinion points out) that &#x93;statistical evidence sometimes &#x91;helps provide a conclusive &#x2026; answer&#x92; concerning the risks that crimes present,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (quoting 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 129).  Today&#x92;s opinion then outdoes 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				in the volume of statistics that it spews forth&#x97;statistics compiled by the International Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries attributable to police pursuits, 
				<em>

				Supreme Court briefs are an inappropriate place to develop the key facts in a case.  We normally give parties more robust protection, leaving important factual questions to district courts and juries aided by expert witnesses and the procedural protections of discovery.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid. 702&#x96;703, 705.  An adversarial process in the trial courts can identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that the parties put forward; here, we accept the studies&#x92; findings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.  The Court does not examine, for example, whether the police-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative sample of all vehicular flights.  The data may be skewed towards the rare and riskier forms of flight.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 6, n. 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kagan
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  We also have no way of knowing how many injuries reported in that data would have occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was driving recklessly even before the police gave chase.  Similar questions undermine confidence in the burglary and arson data the Court cites.  For example, the Court relies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude that 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 9.  But a 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration suggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons.  See Arson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research Series, No. 8, pp. 1&#x96;2 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at http: / / www.usfa.dhs.gov / downloads / pdf / tfrs / v1i8-508.pdf (as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  The Court does not reveal why it chose one dataset over another.  In sum, our statistical analysis in ACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading as statutory interpretation.  Most of the statistics on which the Court relies today come from government-funded studies, and did not make an appearance in this litigation until the Government&#x92;s merits brief to this Court.  See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 128&#x96;129 (demonstrating that the same was true in that case).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But the more fundamental problem with the Court&#x92;s use of statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of the residual clause, it increases the vagueness.  Vagueness, of course, must be measured 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				&#x97;
				<em>
					before 
				</em>
				the Court gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision, not 
				<em>
					after.  
				</em>
				Nothing is vague once the Court decrees precisely what it means.  And is it seriously to be expected that the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry statistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that this-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury than what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be believed) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extortion, or use of explosives?  To ask the question is to answer it.  A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.

				When I dissented from the Court&#x92;s judgment in

        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtually all predicate offenses, &#x2026; ; (2) apply it case by case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the particular reviewing panel) believes there is a &#x91;serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x92; (whatever that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of interpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness &#x2026; .&#x94; 550 U.

				That does not violate the Constitution.  What does vio-late the Constitution is approving the enforcement of a sentencing statute that does not &#x93;give a person of ordinarily intelligence fair notice&#x94; of its reach,

				<em>
					Kolender
				</em>
				, 461 U. S., at 357.  The Court&#x92;s ever-evolving interpretation of the residual clause will keep defendants and judges guessing for years to come.  The reality is that the phrase &#x93;otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x94; does not clearly define the crimes that will subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA penalties.  It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity which the text itself does not honestly contain.  And even if that were our job, the further reality is that we have by now demonstrated our inability to accomplish the task.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We have, I recognize, upheld hopelessly vague criminal statutes in the past&#x97;indeed, in the recent past.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Skilling

				 v.

				</em>
				, at ___ (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia, J.,
				</span>
				 concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).  What sets ACCA apart from those statutes&#x97;and what confirms its incurable vagueness&#x97;is our repeated inability to craft a principled test out of the statutory text.  We have demonstrated by our opinions that the clause is too vague to yield &#x93;an intelligible principle,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 13, each attempt to ignore that reality producing a new regime that is less predictable and more arbitrary than the last.  ACCA&#x92;s residual clause fails to speak with the clarity that criminal proscriptions require.  See

				 v.

				The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be unconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibitions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant&#x92;s conduct.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  Even apart from the fact that our opinions dealing with those statutes have not displayed the confusion evident in our four ACCA efforts,
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				this is not the first time I have found the comparison unpersuasive:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				 &#x93;None of the provisions the Court cites &#x2026; is similar in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical injury with the word &#x91;otherwise,&#x92; preceded by four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to the supposedly defining characteristic. The phrase &#x91;shades of red,&#x92; standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase &#x91;fire-engine red, light pink, maroon,

				We face a Congress that puts forth an ever-increasing volume of laws in general, and of criminal laws in particular.  It should be no surprise that as the volume increases, so do the number of imprecise laws.  And no surprise that our indulgence of imprecisions that violate the Consti-tution encourages imprecisions that violate the Constitution.  Fuzzy, leave-the-details-to-be-sorted-out-by-the-courts legislation is attractive to the Congressman who wants credit for addressing a national problem but does not have the time (or perhaps the votes) to grapple with the nitty-gritty.  In the field of criminal law, at least, it is time to call a halt.  I do not think it would be a radical step&#x97;indeed, I think it would be highly responsible&#x97;to limit ACCA to the named violent crimes.  Congress can quickly add what it wishes.  Because the majority prefers to let vagueness reign, I respectfully dissent.

				As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar-ification of the Delphic residual clause, today&#x92;s opinion produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further confusion.  Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.  Four times is enough.  We should admit that ACCA&#x92;s residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void for vagueness.  See

				ACCA defines &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; in relevant part, as &#x93;any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year &#x2026; that &#x2026; is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

Many years of prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this definition.  A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence and the possibility of life imprisonment.  See &#xA7;924(e)(1); see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harrison
				</em>
				, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009).  Without those prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence, which could not possibly exceed 10 years.  See &#xA7;924(a)(2).

				Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within ACCA&#x92;s residual clause; that is, if it &#x93;involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Today&#x92;s opinion says, or initially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of risk &#x93; &#x91;comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x92; &#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  That is a quotation from the Court&#x92;s opinion in the first of our
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				residual-clause trilogy, 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				, 550 U. S., at 203.  I did not join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was the closest analog.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 230 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  The problem with applying the 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				 standard to the pres-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				ent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under Indiana law are not analogous to 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 of the four enumerated offenses.  See Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 (2004).  Nor is it apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely resembles, for example, statutory rape, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Daye
				</em>
				, 571 F. 3d 225, 228&#x96;236 (CA2 2009); possession of a sawed-off shotgun, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton
				</em>
				, 512 F. 3d 394, 403&#x96;405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison, see 
				<em>
					Chambers,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				.  I predicted this inadequacy of the &#x93;closest analog&#x94; test in my 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				dissent.  See 550 U. S., at 215.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But as it turns out, the Court&#x92;s inability to identify an analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present case.  For today&#x92;s opinion introduces the 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				standard with the words &#x93;[f]or instance,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  It is (according to the Court) merely 
				<em>
					one example
				</em>
				 of how the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explosives) &#x93;provide guidance.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  And the opinion then proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least-risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				&#x97;finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both arson and burglary.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6&#x96;9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But what about the test that determined the outcome in our second case in this &#x93;series&#x94;&#x97;the &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test of 
				<em>
					Begay?
				</em>
				  Fear not.  That incompatible variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in today&#x92;s tutti-frutti opinion.  &#x93;In many cases,&#x94; we are told, it &#x93;will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  That seems to be the case here&#x97;though why, and when it will 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				be the case, are not entirely clear.  The Court&#x92;s accusation that Sykes &#x93;overreads the opinions of this Court,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, apparently applies to his interpretation of 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test, which the Court now suggests applies only &#x93;to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes,&#x94;  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But that makes no sense.  If the test excluded only those unintentional crimes, it would be recast as the &#x93;purposeful&#x94; test, since the last two adjectives (&#x93;violent, and aggressive&#x94;) would do no work.  For that reason, perhaps, all 11 Circuits that have addressed 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				 &#x93;overrea[d]&#x94; it just as Sykes does

				The only case that is not brought forward in today&#x92;s opinion to represent yet another test is the third and most recent in the trilogy, 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/555/122" class="subref" title="subref">555 U.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				was not a crime of violence under ACCA.  But today&#x92;s opinion does cite 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				for another point: Whereas 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be-cause, among other reasons, no &#x93;hard statistics&#x94; on risk-iness &#x93;have been called to our attention,&#x94; 550 U. S., at
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				210; and whereas 
				<em>
					Begay 
				</em>
				made no mention of statistics; 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				explained (as today&#x92;s opinion points out) that &#x93;statistical evidence sometimes &#x91;helps provide a conclusive &#x2026; answer&#x92; concerning the risks that crimes present,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (quoting 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 129).  Today&#x92;s opinion then outdoes 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				in the volume of statistics that it spews forth&#x97;statistics compiled by the International Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries attributable to police pursuits, 
				<em>

				Supreme Court briefs are an inappropriate place to develop the key facts in a case.  We normally give parties more robust protection, leaving important factual questions to district courts and juries aided by expert witnesses and the procedural protections of discovery.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid. 702&#x96;703, 705.  An adversarial process in the trial courts can identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that the parties put forward; here, we accept the studies&#x92; findings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.  The Court does not examine, for example, whether the police-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative sample of all vehicular flights.  The data may be skewed towards the rare and riskier forms of flight.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 6, n. 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kagan
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  We also have no way of knowing how many injuries reported in that data would have occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was driving recklessly even before the police gave chase.  Similar questions undermine confidence in the burglary and arson data the Court cites.  For example, the Court relies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude that 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 9.  But a 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration suggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons.  See Arson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research Series, No. 8, pp. 1&#x96;2 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at http: / / www.usfa.dhs.gov / downloads / pdf / tfrs / v1i8-508.pdf (as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  The Court does not reveal why it chose one dataset over another.  In sum, our statistical analysis in ACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading as statutory interpretation.  Most of the statistics on which the Court relies today come from government-funded studies, and did not make an appearance in this litigation until the Government&#x92;s merits brief to this Court.  See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 128&#x96;129 (demonstrating that the same was true in that case).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But the more fundamental problem with the Court&#x92;s use of statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of the residual clause, it increases the vagueness.  Vagueness, of course, must be measured 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				&#x97;
				<em>
					before 
				</em>
				the Court gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision, not 
				<em>
					after.  
				</em>
				Nothing is vague once the Court decrees precisely what it means.  And is it seriously to be expected that the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry statistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that this-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury than what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be believed) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extortion, or use of explosives?  To ask the question is to answer it.  A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.

				When I dissented from the Court&#x92;s judgment in

        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtually all predicate offenses, &#x2026; ; (2) apply it case by case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the particular reviewing panel) believes there is a &#x91;serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x92; (whatever that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of interpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness &#x2026; .&#x94; 550 U.

				That does not violate the Constitution.  What does vio-late the Constitution is approving the enforcement of a sentencing statute that does not &#x93;give a person of ordinarily intelligence fair notice&#x94; of its reach,

				<em>
					Kolender
				</em>
				, 461 U. S., at 357.  The Court&#x92;s ever-evolving interpretation of the residual clause will keep defendants and judges guessing for years to come.  The reality is that the phrase &#x93;otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x94; does not clearly define the crimes that will subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA penalties.  It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity which the text itself does not honestly contain.  And even if that were our job, the further reality is that we have by now demonstrated our inability to accomplish the task.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We have, I recognize, upheld hopelessly vague criminal statutes in the past&#x97;indeed, in the recent past.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Skilling

				 v.

				</em>
				, at ___ (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia, J.,
				</span>
				 concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).  What sets ACCA apart from those statutes&#x97;and what confirms its incurable vagueness&#x97;is our repeated inability to craft a principled test out of the statutory text.  We have demonstrated by our opinions that the clause is too vague to yield &#x93;an intelligible principle,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 13, each attempt to ignore that reality producing a new regime that is less predictable and more arbitrary than the last.  ACCA&#x92;s residual clause fails to speak with the clarity that criminal proscriptions require.  See

				 v.

				The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be unconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibitions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant&#x92;s conduct.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  Even apart from the fact that our opinions dealing with those statutes have not displayed the confusion evident in our four ACCA efforts,
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				this is not the first time I have found the comparison unpersuasive:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				 &#x93;None of the provisions the Court cites &#x2026; is similar in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical injury with the word &#x91;otherwise,&#x92; preceded by four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to the supposedly defining characteristic. The phrase &#x91;shades of red,&#x92; standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase &#x91;fire-engine red, light pink, maroon,

				We face a Congress that puts forth an ever-increasing volume of laws in general, and of criminal laws in particular.  It should be no surprise that as the volume increases, so do the number of imprecise laws.  And no surprise that our indulgence of imprecisions that violate the Consti-tution encourages imprecisions that violate the Constitution.  Fuzzy, leave-the-details-to-be-sorted-out-by-the-courts legislation is attractive to the Congressman who wants credit for addressing a national problem but does not have the time (or perhaps the votes) to grapple with the nitty-gritty.  In the field of criminal law, at least, it is time to call a halt.  I do not think it would be a radical step&#x97;indeed, I think it would be highly responsible&#x97;to limit ACCA to the named violent crimes.  Congress can quickly add what it wishes.  Because the majority prefers to let vagueness reign, I respectfully dissent.

				As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar-ification of the Delphic residual clause, today&#x92;s opinion produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further confusion.  Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.  Four times is enough.  We should admit that ACCA&#x92;s residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void for vagueness.  See

				ACCA defines &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; in relevant part, as &#x93;any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year &#x2026; that &#x2026; is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

Many years of prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this definition.  A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence and the possibility of life imprisonment.  See &#xA7;924(e)(1); see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harrison
				</em>
				, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009).  Without those prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence, which could not possibly exceed 10 years.  See &#xA7;924(a)(2).

				Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within ACCA&#x92;s residual clause; that is, if it &#x93;involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Today&#x92;s opinion says, or initially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of risk &#x93; &#x91;comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x92; &#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  That is a quotation from the Court&#x92;s opinion in the first of our
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				residual-clause trilogy, 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				, 550 U. S., at 203.  I did not join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was the closest analog.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 230 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  The problem with applying the 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				 standard to the pres-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				ent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under Indiana law are not analogous to 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 of the four enumerated offenses.  See Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 (2004).  Nor is it apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely resembles, for example, statutory rape, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Daye
				</em>
				, 571 F. 3d 225, 228&#x96;236 (CA2 2009); possession of a sawed-off shotgun, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton
				</em>
				, 512 F. 3d 394, 403&#x96;405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison, see 
				<em>
					Chambers,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				.  I predicted this inadequacy of the &#x93;closest analog&#x94; test in my 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				dissent.  See 550 U. S., at 215.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But as it turns out, the Court&#x92;s inability to identify an analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present case.  For today&#x92;s opinion introduces the 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				standard with the words &#x93;[f]or instance,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  It is (according to the Court) merely 
				<em>
					one example
				</em>
				 of how the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explosives) &#x93;provide guidance.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  And the opinion then proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least-risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				&#x97;finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both arson and burglary.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6&#x96;9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But what about the test that determined the outcome in our second case in this &#x93;series&#x94;&#x97;the &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test of 
				<em>
					Begay?
				</em>
				  Fear not.  That incompatible variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in today&#x92;s tutti-frutti opinion.  &#x93;In many cases,&#x94; we are told, it &#x93;will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  That seems to be the case here&#x97;though why, and when it will 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				be the case, are not entirely clear.  The Court&#x92;s accusation that Sykes &#x93;overreads the opinions of this Court,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, apparently applies to his interpretation of 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test, which the Court now suggests applies only &#x93;to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes,&#x94;  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But that makes no sense.  If the test excluded only those unintentional crimes, it would be recast as the &#x93;purposeful&#x94; test, since the last two adjectives (&#x93;violent, and aggressive&#x94;) would do no work.  For that reason, perhaps, all 11 Circuits that have addressed 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				 &#x93;overrea[d]&#x94; it just as Sykes does

				The only case that is not brought forward in today&#x92;s opinion to represent yet another test is the third and most recent in the trilogy, 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/555/122" class="subref" title="subref">555 U.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				was not a crime of violence under ACCA.  But today&#x92;s opinion does cite 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				for another point: Whereas 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be-cause, among other reasons, no &#x93;hard statistics&#x94; on risk-iness &#x93;have been called to our attention,&#x94; 550 U. S., at
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				210; and whereas 
				<em>
					Begay 
				</em>
				made no mention of statistics; 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				explained (as today&#x92;s opinion points out) that &#x93;statistical evidence sometimes &#x91;helps provide a conclusive &#x2026; answer&#x92; concerning the risks that crimes present,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (quoting 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 129).  Today&#x92;s opinion then outdoes 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				in the volume of statistics that it spews forth&#x97;statistics compiled by the International Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries attributable to police pursuits, 
				<em>

				Supreme Court briefs are an inappropriate place to develop the key facts in a case.  We normally give parties more robust protection, leaving important factual questions to district courts and juries aided by expert witnesses and the procedural protections of discovery.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid. 702&#x96;703, 705.  An adversarial process in the trial courts can identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that the parties put forward; here, we accept the studies&#x92; findings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.  The Court does not examine, for example, whether the police-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative sample of all vehicular flights.  The data may be skewed towards the rare and riskier forms of flight.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 6, n. 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kagan
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  We also have no way of knowing how many injuries reported in that data would have occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was driving recklessly even before the police gave chase.  Similar questions undermine confidence in the burglary and arson data the Court cites.  For example, the Court relies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude that 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 9.  But a 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration suggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons.  See Arson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research Series, No. 8, pp. 1&#x96;2 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at http: / / www.usfa.dhs.gov / downloads / pdf / tfrs / v1i8-508.pdf (as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  The Court does not reveal why it chose one dataset over another.  In sum, our statistical analysis in ACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading as statutory interpretation.  Most of the statistics on which the Court relies today come from government-funded studies, and did not make an appearance in this litigation until the Government&#x92;s merits brief to this Court.  See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 128&#x96;129 (demonstrating that the same was true in that case).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But the more fundamental problem with the Court&#x92;s use of statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of the residual clause, it increases the vagueness.  Vagueness, of course, must be measured 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				&#x97;
				<em>
					before 
				</em>
				the Court gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision, not 
				<em>
					after.  
				</em>
				Nothing is vague once the Court decrees precisely what it means.  And is it seriously to be expected that the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry statistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that this-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury than what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be believed) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extortion, or use of explosives?  To ask the question is to answer it.  A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.

				When I dissented from the Court&#x92;s judgment in

        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtually all predicate offenses, &#x2026; ; (2) apply it case by case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the particular reviewing panel) believes there is a &#x91;serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x92; (whatever that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of interpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness &#x2026; .&#x94; 550 U.

				That does not violate the Constitution.  What does vio-late the Constitution is approving the enforcement of a sentencing statute that does not &#x93;give a person of ordinarily intelligence fair notice&#x94; of its reach,

				<em>
					Kolender
				</em>
				, 461 U. S., at 357.  The Court&#x92;s ever-evolving interpretation of the residual clause will keep defendants and judges guessing for years to come.  The reality is that the phrase &#x93;otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x94; does not clearly define the crimes that will subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA penalties.  It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity which the text itself does not honestly contain.  And even if that were our job, the further reality is that we have by now demonstrated our inability to accomplish the task.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We have, I recognize, upheld hopelessly vague criminal statutes in the past&#x97;indeed, in the recent past.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Skilling

				 v.

				</em>
				, at ___ (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia, J.,
				</span>
				 concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).  What sets ACCA apart from those statutes&#x97;and what confirms its incurable vagueness&#x97;is our repeated inability to craft a principled test out of the statutory text.  We have demonstrated by our opinions that the clause is too vague to yield &#x93;an intelligible principle,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 13, each attempt to ignore that reality producing a new regime that is less predictable and more arbitrary than the last.  ACCA&#x92;s residual clause fails to speak with the clarity that criminal proscriptions require.  See

				 v.

				The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be unconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibitions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant&#x92;s conduct.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  Even apart from the fact that our opinions dealing with those statutes have not displayed the confusion evident in our four ACCA efforts,
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				this is not the first time I have found the comparison unpersuasive:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				 &#x93;None of the provisions the Court cites &#x2026; is similar in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical injury with the word &#x91;otherwise,&#x92; preceded by four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to the supposedly defining characteristic. The phrase &#x91;shades of red,&#x92; standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase &#x91;fire-engine red, light pink, maroon,

				We face a Congress that puts forth an ever-increasing volume of laws in general, and of criminal laws in particular.  It should be no surprise that as the volume increases, so do the number of imprecise laws.  And no surprise that our indulgence of imprecisions that violate the Consti-tution encourages imprecisions that violate the Constitution.  Fuzzy, leave-the-details-to-be-sorted-out-by-the-courts legislation is attractive to the Congressman who wants credit for addressing a national problem but does not have the time (or perhaps the votes) to grapple with the nitty-gritty.  In the field of criminal law, at least, it is time to call a halt.  I do not think it would be a radical step&#x97;indeed, I think it would be highly responsible&#x97;to limit ACCA to the named violent crimes.  Congress can quickly add what it wishes.  Because the majority prefers to let vagueness reign, I respectfully dissent.

				As was perhaps predictable, instead of producing a clar-ification of the Delphic residual clause, today&#x92;s opinion produces a fourth ad hoc judgment that will sow further confusion.  Insanity, it has been said, is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.  Four times is enough.  We should admit that ACCA&#x92;s residual provision is a drafting failure and declare it void for vagueness.  See

				ACCA defines &#x93;violent felony,&#x94; in relevant part, as &#x93;any crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year &#x2026; that &#x2026; is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;

Many years of prison hinge on whether a crime falls within this definition.  A felon convicted of possessing a firearm who has three prior violent-felony convictions faces a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence and the possibility of life imprisonment.  See &#xA7;924(e)(1); see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Harrison
				</em>
				, 558 F. 3d 1280, 1282, n. 1 (CA11 2009).  Without those prior convictions, he would face a much lesser sentence, which could not possibly exceed 10 years.  See &#xA7;924(a)(2).

				Vehicular flight is a violent felony only if it falls within ACCA&#x92;s residual clause; that is, if it &#x93;involves conduct
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.&#x94;  &#xA7;924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Today&#x92;s opinion says, or initially seems to say, that an offense qualifies as a violent felony if its elements, in the typical case, create a degree
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of risk &#x93; &#x91;comparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses.&#x92; &#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  That is a quotation from the Court&#x92;s opinion in the first of our
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				residual-clause trilogy, 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				, 550 U. S., at 203.  I did not join that opinion because I thought it should suffice if the elements created a degree of risk comparable to the least risky of the enumerated offenses, whether or not it was the closest analog.  See 
				<em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 230 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  The problem with applying the 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				 standard to the pres-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				ent case is that the elements of vehicular flight under Indiana law are not analogous to 
				<em>
					any
				</em>
				 of the four enumerated offenses.  See Ind. Code &#xA7;35&#x96;44&#x96;3&#x96;3 (2004).  Nor is it apparent which of the enumerated offenses most closely resembles, for example, statutory rape, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Daye
				</em>
				, 571 F. 3d 225, 228&#x96;236 (CA2 2009); possession of a sawed-off shotgun, see 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton
				</em>
				, 512 F. 3d 394, 403&#x96;405 (CA7 2008); or a failure to report to prison, see 
				<em>
					Chambers,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				.  I predicted this inadequacy of the &#x93;closest analog&#x94; test in my 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				dissent.  See 550 U. S., at 215.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But as it turns out, the Court&#x92;s inability to identify an analog makes no difference to the outcome of the present case.  For today&#x92;s opinion introduces the 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				standard with the words &#x93;[f]or instance,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6.  It is (according to the Court) merely 
				<em>
					one example
				</em>
				 of how the enumerated crimes (burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes using explosives) &#x93;provide guidance.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				  And the opinion then proceeds to obtain guidance from the risky-as-the-least-risky test that I suggested (but the Court rejected) in 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				&#x97;finding vehicular flight at least as risky as both arson and burglary.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 6&#x96;9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But what about the test that determined the outcome in our second case in this &#x93;series&#x94;&#x97;the &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test of 
				<em>
					Begay?
				</em>
				  Fear not.  That incompatible variation has been neither overlooked nor renounced in today&#x92;s tutti-frutti opinion.  &#x93;In many cases,&#x94; we are told, it &#x93;will be redundant with the inquiry into risk.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  That seems to be the case here&#x97;though why, and when it will 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				be the case, are not entirely clear.  The Court&#x92;s accusation that Sykes &#x93;overreads the opinions of this Court,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 10, apparently applies to his interpretation of 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;purposeful, violent, and aggressive&#x94; test, which the Court now suggests applies only &#x93;to strict liability, negligence, and recklessness crimes,&#x94;  
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 11.  But that makes no sense.  If the test excluded only those unintentional crimes, it would be recast as the &#x93;purposeful&#x94; test, since the last two adjectives (&#x93;violent, and aggressive&#x94;) would do no work.  For that reason, perhaps, all 11 Circuits that have addressed 
				<em>
					Begay
				</em>
				 &#x93;overrea[d]&#x94; it just as Sykes does

				The only case that is not brought forward in today&#x92;s opinion to represent yet another test is the third and most recent in the trilogy, 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/555/122" class="subref" title="subref">555 U.

				<span class="softbreak"/>
				was not a crime of violence under ACCA.  But today&#x92;s opinion does cite 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				for another point: Whereas 
				<em>
					James 
				</em>
				rejected the risky-as-the-least-risky approach be-cause, among other reasons, no &#x93;hard statistics&#x94; on risk-iness &#x93;have been called to our attention,&#x94; 550 U. S., at
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				210; and whereas 
				<em>
					Begay 
				</em>
				made no mention of statistics; 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				explained (as today&#x92;s opinion points out) that &#x93;statistical evidence sometimes &#x91;helps provide a conclusive &#x2026; answer&#x92; concerning the risks that crimes present,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 8 (quoting 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 129).  Today&#x92;s opinion then outdoes 
				<em>
					Chambers 
				</em>
				in the volume of statistics that it spews forth&#x97;statistics compiled by the International Association of Chiefs of Police concerning injuries attributable to police pursuits, 
				<em>

				Supreme Court briefs are an inappropriate place to develop the key facts in a case.  We normally give parties more robust protection, leaving important factual questions to district courts and juries aided by expert witnesses and the procedural protections of discovery.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(F), (G); Fed. Rules Evid. 702&#x96;703, 705.  An adversarial process in the trial courts can identify flaws in the methodology of the studies that the parties put forward; here, we accept the studies&#x92; findings on faith, without examining their methodology at all.  The Court does not examine, for example, whether the police-pursuit data on which it relies is a representative sample of all vehicular flights.  The data may be skewed towards the rare and riskier forms of flight.  See 
				<em>
					post
				</em>
				, at 6, n. 4 (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Kagan
				</span>
				, J., dissenting).  We also have no way of knowing how many injuries reported in that data would have occurred even absent pursuit, by a driver who was driving recklessly even before the police gave chase.  Similar questions undermine confidence in the burglary and arson data the Court cites.  For example, the Court relies on a U. S. Fire Administration dataset to conclude that 3.3 injuries occur per 100 arsons. See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 9.  But a 2001 report from the same U. S. Fire Administration suggests that roughly 1 injury occurs per 100 arsons.  See Arson in the United States, Vol. 1 Topical Fire Research Series, No. 8, pp. 1&#x96;2 (rev. Dec. 2001), online at http: / / www.usfa.dhs.gov / downloads / pdf / tfrs / v1i8-508.pdf (as visited May 27, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  The Court does not reveal why it chose one dataset over another.  In sum, our statistical analysis in ACCA cases is untested judicial factfinding masquerading as statutory interpretation.  Most of the statistics on which the Court relies today come from government-funded studies, and did not make an appearance in this litigation until the Government&#x92;s merits brief to this Court.  See Brief for Petitioner 17; see also 
				<em>
					Chambers
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 128&#x96;129 (demonstrating that the same was true in that case).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				But the more fundamental problem with the Court&#x92;s use of statistics is that, far from eliminating the vagueness
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				of the residual clause, it increases the vagueness.  Vagueness, of course, must be measured 
				<em>
					ex ante
				</em>
				&#x97;
				<em>
					before 
				</em>
				the Court gives definitive meaning to a statutory provision, not 
				<em>
					after.  
				</em>
				Nothing is vague once the Court decrees precisely what it means.  And is it seriously to be expected that the average citizen would be familiar with the sundry statistical studies showing (if they are to be believed) that this-or-that crime is more likely to lead to physical injury than what sundry statistical studies (if they are to be believed) show to be the case for burglary, arson, extortion, or use of explosives?  To ask the question is to answer it.  A few words, then, about unconstitutional vagueness.

				When I dissented from the Court&#x92;s judgment in

        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;They can (1) apply the ACCA enhancement to virtually all predicate offenses, &#x2026; ; (2) apply it case by case in its pristine abstraction, finding it applicable whenever the particular sentencing judge (or the particular reviewing panel) believes there is a &#x91;serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x92; (whatever that means); (3) try to figure out a coherent way of interpreting the statute so that it applies in a relatively predictable and administrable fashion to a smaller subset of crimes; or (4) recognize the statute for the drafting failure it is and hold it void for vagueness &#x2026; .&#x94; 550 U.

				That does not violate the Constitution.  What does vio-late the Constitution is approving the enforcement of a sentencing statute that does not &#x93;give a person of ordinarily intelligence fair notice&#x94; of its reach,

				<em>
					Kolender
				</em>
				, 461 U. S., at 357.  The Court&#x92;s ever-evolving interpretation of the residual clause will keep defendants and judges guessing for years to come.  The reality is that the phrase &#x93;otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another&#x94; does not clearly define the crimes that will subject defendants to the greatly increased ACCA penalties.  It is not the job of this Court to impose a clarity which the text itself does not honestly contain.  And even if that were our job, the further reality is that we have by now demonstrated our inability to accomplish the task.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We have, I recognize, upheld hopelessly vague criminal statutes in the past&#x97;indeed, in the recent past.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Skilling

				 v.

				</em>
				, at ___ (
				<span class="smallcaps">
					Scalia, J.,
				</span>
				 concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1).  What sets ACCA apart from those statutes&#x97;and what confirms its incurable vagueness&#x97;is our repeated inability to craft a principled test out of the statutory text.  We have demonstrated by our opinions that the clause is too vague to yield &#x93;an intelligible principle,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 13, each attempt to ignore that reality producing a new regime that is less predictable and more arbitrary than the last.  ACCA&#x92;s residual clause fails to speak with the clarity that criminal proscriptions require.  See

				 v.

				The Court believes that the residual clause cannot be unconstitutionally vague because other criminal prohibitions also refer to the degree of risk posed by a defendant&#x92;s conduct.  See 
				<em>
					ante
				</em>
				, at 14.  Even apart from the fact that our opinions dealing with those statutes have not displayed the confusion evident in our four ACCA efforts,
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				this is not the first time I have found the comparison unpersuasive:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				 &#x93;None of the provisions the Court cites &#x2026; is similar in the crucial relevant respect: None prefaces its judicially-to-be-determined requirement of risk of physical injury with the word &#x91;otherwise,&#x92; preceded by four confusing examples that have little in common with respect to the supposedly defining characteristic. The phrase &#x91;shades of red,&#x92; standing alone, does not generate confusion or unpredictability; but the phrase &#x91;fire-engine red, light pink, maroon,

				We face a Congress that puts forth an ever-increasing volume of laws in general, and of criminal laws in particular.  It should be no surprise that as the volume increases, so do the number of imprecise laws.  And no surprise that our indulgence of imprecisions that violate the Consti-tution encourages imprecisions that violate the Constitution.  Fuzzy, leave-the-details-to-be-sorted-out-by-the-courts legislation is attractive to the Congressman who wants credit for addressing a national problem but does not have the time (or perhaps the votes) to grapple with the nitty-gritty.  In the field of criminal law, at least, it is time to call a halt.  I do not think it would be a radical step&#x97;indeed, I think it would be highly responsible&#x97;to limit ACCA to the named violent crimes.  Congress can quickly add what it wishes.  Because the majority prefers to let vagueness reign, I respectfully dissent.
