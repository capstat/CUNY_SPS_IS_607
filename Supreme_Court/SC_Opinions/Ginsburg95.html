				This case stems from a California county&#x92;s investigation of Native American tribe members for alleged off-reservation crimes.  Pursuing the investigation, county law-enforcement officers executed a state court warrant for casino employment records kept by the Tribe on its reservation.  The Tribe sued the County, the District Attorney, and the Sheriff in federal court, asserting sovereign immunity from state court processes and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.

				The parties and, as 
				<em>
					amicus
				</em>
            <em>
					curiae
				</em>
				, the United States agree that a Native American Tribe, like a State of the United States, is not a &#x93;person&#x94; subject to suit under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;1983</a>.  We hold that, in the situation here presented, the Tribe does not qualify as a &#x93;person&#x94; who may sue under &#xA7;1983.  Whether the Tribe&#x92;s suit qualifies for federal-court jurisdiction because it arises under some federal law other than &#xA7;1983 is an issue the parties have not precisely addressed, and the trial and appellate courts have not clearly decided.  We therefore remand the case for close consideration and specific resolution of that threshold question.

				In March 1999, the Inyo County Department of Health and Human Services received information from the State Department of Social Services indicating that three Casino employees had failed to report Casino earnings on their applications for state welfare benefits.

				In February 2000, the District Attorney&#x92;s Office asked the Casino for the three employees&#x92; employment records, explaining that it was investigating &#x93;alleged welfare fraud.&#x94;  291 F. 3d 549, 554 (CA9 2002).  The Tribe responded that its privacy policy precluded release of the records without the employees&#x92; consent.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The District Attorney then sought and, on showing probable cause, obtained a search warrant from the Inyo County Superior Court.  The warrant authorized a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees.  On March 23, 2000, the Inyo County Sheriff and the District Attorney executed the warrant.  They did so over the objection of tribal officials.  Those officials urged that the state court lacked jurisdiction to authorize a search of premises and seizure of records belonging to a sovereign tribe.

				  The Sheriff and the District Attorney, lacking cooperation from the Tribe, cut the locks off the storage facility containing the Casino&#x92;s personnel records.  The county officials seized timecard entries, payroll registers, and payroll check registers relating to the three employees; the seizure also garnered information contained in quarterly wage and withholding reports the Corporation had submitted to the State.  Each item seized contained at least one reference to an employee under investigation.

				In July 2000, the District Attorney&#x92;s Office asked the Tribe for the personnel records of six other Casino employees.  The Tribe reiterated its privacy policy, but offered to accept as evidence of consent a redacted copy of the last page of each employee&#x92;s signed welfare application.  That page contained a statement that employment records of individuals applying for public assistance were subject to review by county officials.  The District Attorney refused the offer.

				On November 22, 2000, the District Court, on defendants&#x92; motion, dismissed the Tribe&#x92;s complaint.  Tribal sovereign immunity, the court held, did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the Casino&#x92;s personnel records.  Taking into account the competing interests of the State and the Tribe, the court concluded that, &#x93;[i]n the interest of a fair and uniform application of California&#x92;s criminal law, state officials should be able to execute search warrant[s] against the tribe and tribal property.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a.

				This case stems from a California county&#x92;s investigation of Native American tribe members for alleged off-reservation crimes.  Pursuing the investigation, county law-enforcement officers executed a state court warrant for casino employment records kept by the Tribe on its reservation.  The Tribe sued the County, the District Attorney, and the Sheriff in federal court, asserting sovereign immunity from state court processes and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.

Whether the Tribe&#x92;s suit qualifies for federal-court jurisdiction because it arises under some federal law other than &#xA7;1983 is an issue the parties have not precisely addressed, and the trial and appellate courts have not clearly decided.

				In February 2000, the District Attorney&#x92;s Office asked the Casino for the three employees&#x92; employment records, explaining that it was investigating &#x93;alleged welfare fraud.&#x94;  291 F. 3d 549, 554 (CA9 2002).  The Tribe responded that its privacy policy precluded release of the records without the employees&#x92; consent.

				The District Attorney then sought and, on showing probable cause, obtained a search warrant from the Inyo County Superior Court.  The warrant authorized a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees.  On March 23, 2000, the Inyo County Sheriff and the District Attorney executed the warrant.  They did so over the objection of tribal officials.  Those officials urged that the state court lacked jurisdiction to authorize a search of premises and seizure of records belonging to a sovereign tribe.

				  The Sheriff and the District Attorney, lacking cooperation from the Tribe, cut the locks off the storage facility containing the Casino&#x92;s personnel records.  The county officials seized timecard entries, payroll registers, and payroll check registers relating to the three employees; the seizure also garnered information contained in quarterly wage and withholding reports the Corporation had submitted to the State.  Each item seized contained at least one reference to an employee under investigation.

The Tribe reiterated its privacy policy, but offered to accept as evidence of consent a redacted copy of the last page of each employee&#x92;s signed welfare application.  That page contained a statement that employment records of individuals applying for public assistance were subject to review by county officials.  The District Attorney refused the offer.

				To ward off any additional searches, the Tribe and the Corporation filed suit in Federal District Court naming as defendants the District Attorney and the Sheriff in their individual and official capacities, and the County.  Asserting federal question jurisdiction under

				On November 22, 2000, the District Court, on defendants&#x92; motion, dismissed the Tribe&#x92;s complaint.  Tribal sovereign immunity, the court held, did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the Casino&#x92;s personnel records.  Taking into account the competing interests of the State and the Tribe, the court concluded that, &#x93;[i]n the interest of a fair and uniform application of California&#x92;s criminal law, state officials should be able to execute search warrant[s] against the tribe and tribal property.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a.

				the District Court&#x92;s judgment dismissing the action.  &#x93;[E]xecution of a search warrant against the Tribe,&#x94; the Court of Appeals said, &#x93;interferes with &#x91;the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.&#x92; &#x94;  291 F. 3d, at 558 (quoting

).  In the appellate court&#x92;s view, the District Court should not have &#x93;balanced the interests at stake&#x94; to determine whether the warrant was enforceable.  291 F. 3d, at 559.  This Court&#x92;s precedent, the Ninth Circuit said, advanced &#x93;a more categorical approach denying state jurisdiction &#x2026; over a tribe absent a waiver by the tribe or a clear grant of authority by Congress.&#x94;

				&#x93;[E]ven if a balancing test is the appropriate legal framework,&#x94; the Court of Appeals added, &#x93;the balance of interests favors a ruling for the Tribe.&#x94;  291 F. 3d, at 559.  The Tribe&#x92;s privacy policies regarding employee records &#x93;promote tribal [self-government] interests,&#x94; the Ninth Circuit reasoned; notably, those policies fostered &#x93;a trusting relationship with tribal members,&#x94; and &#x93;affect[ed] the Casino, the Tribe&#x92;s predominant source of economic development revenue.&#x94;

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> and therefore within &#xA7;1983&#x92;s compass.  291 F. 3d, at 568, and n. 7.  On December 2, 2002, we granted certiorari.

				There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective.  It is only by virtue of the Tribe&#x92;s asserted &#x93;sovereign&#x94; status that it claims immunity from the County&#x92;s processes.  See App. 97&#x96;105, &#xB6;&#xB6;1&#x96;25, 108&#x96;110, &#xB6;&#xB6;33&#x96;39; 291 F. 3d, at 554 (Court of Appeals &#x93;find[s] that the County and its agents

				<em>
					Will

				, 491 U. S., at 66, not to advance a sovereign&#x92;s prerogative to withhold evidence relevant to a criminal investigation.  For example, as the County acknowledges, a tribal member complaining of a 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> violation would be a &#x93;person&#x94; qualified to sue under &#xA7;1983.  See Brief for Petitioners 20, n. 7.  But, like other private persons, that member would have no right to immunity from an appropriately executed search warrant based on probable cause.  Accordingly, we hold that the Tribe may not sue under &#xA7;1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims.

				This case stems from a California county&#x92;s investigation of Native American tribe members for alleged off-reservation crimes.  Pursuing the investigation, county law-enforcement officers executed a state court warrant for casino employment records kept by the Tribe on its reservation.  The Tribe sued the County, the District Attorney, and the Sheriff in federal court, asserting sovereign immunity from state court processes and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.

Whether the Tribe&#x92;s suit qualifies for federal-court jurisdiction because it arises under some federal law other than &#xA7;1983 is an issue the parties have not precisely addressed, and the trial and appellate courts have not clearly decided.  We therefore remand the case for close consideration and specific resolution of that threshold question.

				The District Attorney then sought and, on showing probable cause, obtained a search warrant from the Inyo County Superior Court.  The warrant authorized a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees.  On March 23, 2000, the Inyo County Sheriff and the District Attorney executed the warrant.  They did so over the objection of tribal officials.  Those officials urged that the state court lacked jurisdiction to authorize a search of premises and seizure of records belonging to a sovereign tribe.

				  The Sheriff and the District Attorney, lacking cooperation from the Tribe, cut the locks off the storage facility containing the Casino&#x92;s personnel records.  The county officials seized timecard entries, payroll registers, and payroll check registers relating to the three employees; the seizure also garnered information contained in quarterly wage and withholding reports the Corporation had submitted to the State.  Each item seized contained at least one reference to an employee under investigation.

That page contained a statement that employment records of individuals applying for public assistance were subject to review by county officials.  The District Attorney refused the offer.

				To ward off any additional searches, the Tribe and the Corporation filed suit in Federal District Court naming as defendants the District Attorney and the Sheriff in their individual and official capacities, and the County.  Asserting federal question jurisdiction under

				On November 22, 2000, the District Court, on defendants&#x92; motion, dismissed the Tribe&#x92;s complaint.  Tribal sovereign immunity, the court held, did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the Casino&#x92;s personnel records.  Taking into account the competing interests of the State and the Tribe, the court concluded that, &#x93;[i]n the interest of a fair and uniform application of California&#x92;s criminal law, state officials should be able to execute search warrant[s] against the tribe and tribal property.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a.

This Court&#x92;s precedent, the Ninth Circuit said, advanced &#x93;a more categorical approach denying state jurisdiction &#x2026; over a tribe absent a waiver by the tribe or a clear grant of authority by Congress.&#x94;

The Tribe&#x92;s privacy policies regarding employee records &#x93;promote tribal [self-government] interests,&#x94; the Ninth Circuit reasoned; notably, those policies fostered &#x93;a trusting relationship with tribal members,&#x94; and &#x93;affect[ed] the Casino, the Tribe&#x92;s predominant source of economic development revenue.&#x94;

				There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective.

See App. 97&#x96;105, &#xB6;&#xB6;1&#x96;25, 108&#x96;110, &#xB6;&#xB6;33&#x96;39; 291 F. 3d, at 554 (Court of Appeals &#x93;find[s] that the County and its agents

Accordingly, we hold that the Tribe may not sue under &#xA7;1983 to vindicate the sovereign right it here claims.

				This case stems from a California county&#x92;s investigation of Native American tribe members for alleged off-reservation crimes.  Pursuing the investigation, county law-enforcement officers executed a state court warrant for casino employment records kept by the Tribe on its reservation.  The Tribe sued the County, the District Attorney, and the Sheriff in federal court, asserting sovereign immunity from state court processes and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.

They did so over the objection of tribal officials.

The Tribe&#x92;s privacy policies regarding employee records &#x93;promote tribal [self-government] interests,&#x94; the Ninth Circuit reasoned; notably, those policies fostered &#x93;a trusting relationship with tribal members,&#x94; and &#x93;affect[ed] the Casino, the Tribe&#x92;s predominant source of economic development revenue.&#x94;

				There is in this case no allegation that the County lacked probable cause or that the warrant was otherwise defective.

				This case stems from a California county&#x92;s investigation of Native American tribe members for alleged off-reservation crimes.  Pursuing the investigation, county law-enforcement officers executed a state court warrant for casino employment records kept by the Tribe on its reservation.  The Tribe sued the County, the District Attorney, and the Sheriff in federal court, asserting sovereign immunity from state court processes and seeking declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.

				In February 2000, the District Attorney&#x92;s Office asked the Casino for the three employees&#x92; employment records, explaining that it was investigating &#x93;alleged welfare fraud.&#x94;  291 F. 3d 549, 554 (CA9 2002).  The Tribe responded that its privacy policy precluded release of the records without the employees&#x92; consent.

				The District Attorney then sought and, on showing probable cause, obtained a search warrant from the Inyo County Superior Court.  The warrant authorized a search of the Casino for payroll records of the three employees.  On March 23, 2000, the Inyo County Sheriff and the District Attorney executed the warrant.  They did so over the objection of tribal officials.  Those officials urged that the state court lacked jurisdiction to authorize a search of premises and seizure of records belonging to a sovereign tribe.

				  The Sheriff and the District Attorney, lacking cooperation from the Tribe, cut the locks off the storage facility containing the Casino&#x92;s personnel records.  The county officials seized timecard entries, payroll registers, and payroll check registers relating to the three employees; the seizure also garnered information contained in quarterly wage and withholding reports the Corporation had submitted to the State.  Each item seized contained at least one reference to an employee under investigation.

				In July 2000, the District Attorney&#x92;s Office asked the Tribe for the personnel records of six other Casino employees.  The Tribe reiterated its privacy policy, but offered to accept as evidence of consent a redacted copy of the last page of each employee&#x92;s signed welfare application.  That page contained a statement that employment records of individuals applying for public assistance were subject to review by county officials.  The District Attorney refused the offer.

				On November 22, 2000, the District Court, on defendants&#x92; motion, dismissed the Tribe&#x92;s complaint.  Tribal sovereign immunity, the court held, did not categorically preclude the search and seizure of the Casino&#x92;s personnel records.  Taking into account the competing interests of the State and the Tribe, the court concluded that, &#x93;[i]n the interest of a fair and uniform application of California&#x92;s criminal law, state officials should be able to execute search warrant[s] against the tribe and tribal property.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a.

The Tribe&#x92;s privacy policies regarding employee records &#x93;promote tribal [self-government] interests,&#x94; the Ninth Circuit reasoned; notably, those policies fostered &#x93;a trusting relationship with tribal members,&#x94; and &#x93;affect[ed] the Casino, the Tribe&#x92;s predominant source of economic development revenue.&#x94;

						 The United States maintains, and the County does not dispute, that the Corporation is an &#x93;arm&#x94; of the Tribe for sovereign immunity purposes.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 11&#x96;14.

						 At oral argument, the County defended this refusal by asserting that federal law prohibited it from releasing the relevant pages of the employees&#x92; welfare applications.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4&#x96;5.  But the United States assured the Court that &#x93;[t]here is no Federal regulation or other Federal requirement&#x94; that would have prevented the County from sharing the relevant information with the Tribe.  Id., at 21.  This entire controversy, it thus appears, might have been avoided had the county officials understood that federal law allowed the accommodation sought by the Tribe.

						 Courts of Appeals have expressed divergent views on this question.  See Native Village of Venetie IRA Council v. Alaska, 155 F. 3d 1150, 1152, n. 1 (CA9 1998) (concluding that Tribes are persons entitled to sue under &#xA7;1983); American Vantage Co. v. Table Mountain Rancheria, 292 F. 3d 1091, 1097, n. 4 (CA9 2002) (&#x93;[I]t is doubtful whether [a] Tribe qua sovereign would qualify as a &#x91;citizen of the United States or other person&#x92; eligible to bring an action under &#xA7;1983.&#x94; (quoting White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Williams, 810 F. 2d 844, 865, n. 16 (CA9 1987) (Fletcher, J., dissenting))); cf. Illinois v. Chicago, 137 F. 3d 474, 477 (CA7 1998) (stating in dictum that &#x93;a state is not a &#x91;person&#x92; under [&#xA7;1983]&#x94;); Pennsylvania v. Porter, 659 F. 2d 306, 314&#x96;318 (CA3 1981) (en banc) (holding that a State may bring a &#xA7;1983 action in a parens patriae capacity).

						 It hardly &#x93;demean[s] . . . Native American Tribes,&#x94; see post, at 1 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment), in our view, to bracket them with States of the Union in this regard.
