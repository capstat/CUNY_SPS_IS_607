        <p class="bodytext">
				Respondent Chicago Park District adopted an ordinance requiring individuals to obtain a permit before conducting large-scale events in public parks.  The ordinance provides that the Park District may deny a permit on any of 13 specified grounds, must process applications within 28 days, and must explain its reasons for a denial.  An unsuccessful applicant may appeal, first, to the Park District&#x92;s general superintendent and then to state court.  Petitioners, dissatisfied that the Park District has denied some, though not all, of their applications for permits to hold rallies advocating the legalization of marijuana, filed a 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/1983.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;1983</a> suit, alleging, 
				<em>
					inter alia,
				</em>
				 that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face.  The District Court granted the Park District summary judgment, and the Seventh Circuit affirmed.

				1. A content-neutral permit scheme regulating uses (including speech uses) of a public forum need not contain the procedural safeguards described in 
				<em>
					Freedman
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Maryland,
				</em>

				<em>
					Freedman
				</em>
				 is inapposite because, unlike the motion picture censorship scheme in that case, the Park District&#x92;s ordinance is not subject-matter censorship but content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation of the use of a public forum.  None of the grounds for denying a permit has anything to do with the content of speech.  Indeed, the ordinance is not directed at communicative activity as such, but to all activity in a public park.  And its object is not to exclude particular communication, but to coordinate multiple uses of limited space; assure preservation of park facilities; prevent dangerous, unlawful, or impermissible uses; and assure financial accountability for damage caused by an event.  Pp. 4&#x96;7.

				2. A content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation can be applied in such a manner as to stifle free expression.  It thus must contain adequate standards to guide an official&#x92;s decision and render that decision subject to effective judicial review.  See

				Respondent, the Chicago Park District (Park District), is responsible for operating public parks and other public property in Chicago.  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 70, &#xA7;1505/7.01 (2001).  Pursuant to its authority to &#x93;establish by ordinance all needful rules and regulations for the government and protection of parks &#x2026; and other property under its jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1505/7.02, the Park District adopted an ordinance that requires a person to obtain a permit in order to &#x93;conduct a public assembly, parade, picnic, or other event involving more than fifty individuals,&#x94; or engage in an activity such as &#x93;creat[ing] or emit[ting] any Amplified Sound.&#x94;  Chicago Park Dist. Code, ch. VII, &#xA7;&#xA7;C.3.a(1), C.3.a(6).  The ordinance provides that &#x93;[a]pplications for permits shall be processed in order of receipt,&#x94; &#xA7;C.5.a, and the Park District must decide whether to grant or deny an application within 14 days unless, by written notice to the applicant, it extends the period an additional 14 days, &#xA7;C.5.c.  Applications can be denied on any of 13 specified grounds.  &#xA7;C.5.e.

, we confronted a state law that enacted a strikingly similar system of prior restraint for motion pictures.  It required that every motion picture film be submitted to a Board of Censors before the film was shown anywhere in the State.  The Board enjoyed authority to reject films that it considered &#x93; &#x91;obscene&#x92; &#x94; or that &#x93; &#x91;tend[ed], in the judgment of the Board, to debase or corrupt morals or incite to crimes,&#x92; &#x94; characteristics defined by the statute in broad terms.

				Petitioners contend that the Park District, like the Board of Censors in

				</em>
				, must initiate litigation every time it denies a permit and that the ordinance must specify a deadline for judicial review of a challenge to a permit denial.  We reject those contentions.  
				<em>
					Freedman
				</em>
				 is inapposite because the licensing scheme at issue here is not subject-matter censorship but content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation of the use of a public forum.  The Park District&#x92;s ordinance does not authorize a licensor to pass judgment on the content of speech: None of the grounds for denying a permit has anything to do with what a speaker might say.  Indeed, the ordinance (unlike the classic censorship scheme) is not even directed to communicative activity as such, but rather to 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 activity conducted in a public park.  The picnicker and soccer-player, no less than the political activist or parade marshal, must apply for a permit if the 50-person limit is to be exceeded.  And the object of the permit system (as plainly indicated by the permissible grounds for permit denial) is not to exclude communication of a particular content, but to coordinate multiple uses of limited space, to assure preservation of the park facilities, to prevent uses that are dangerous, unlawful, or impermissible under the Park District&#x92;s rules, and to assure financial accountability for damage caused by the event.  As the Court of Appeals well put it: &#x93;[T]o allow unregulated access to all comers could easily reduce rather than enlarge the park&#x92;s utility as a forum for speech.&#x94;  227 F. 3d 921, 924 (CA7 2000).

				Of course even content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions can be applied in such a manner as to stifle free expression.  Where the licensing official enjoys unduly broad discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a permit, there is a risk that he will favor or disfavor speech based on its content.  See

				We think not.  As we have described, the Park District may deny a permit only for one or more of the reasons set forth in the ordinance.  See n. 1, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				.  It may deny, for example, when the application is incomplete or contains a material falsehood or misrepresentation; when the applicant has damaged Park District property on prior occasions and has not paid for the damage; when a permit has been granted to an earlier applicant for the same time and place; when the intended use would present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety of park users or Park District employees; or when the applicant has violated the terms of a prior permit.  See Chicago Park Dist. Code, ch. VII, &#xA7;C.5.e.  Moreover, the Park District must process applications within 28 days, &#xA7;C.5.c, and must clearly explain its reasons for any denial, &#xA7;C.5.e.

				Petitioners contend that the criteria set forth in the ordinance are insufficiently precise because they are described as grounds on which the Park District &#x93;may&#x94; deny a permit, rather than grounds on which it 
				<em>
					must
				</em>
				 do so.  This, they contend, allows the Park District to waive the permit requirements for some favored speakers, while insisting upon them for others.  That is certainly not the intent of the ordinance, which the Park District has reasonably interpreted to permit overlooking only those inadequacies that, under the circumstances, do no harm to the policies furthered by the application requirements.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31&#x96;32.  Granting waivers to favored speakers (or, more precisely, denying them to disfavored speakers) would of course be unconstitutional, but we think that this abuse must be dealt with if and when a pattern of unlawful favoritism appears, rather than by insisting upon a degree of rigidity that is found in few legal arrangements.  On petitioners&#x92; theory, every obscenity law, or every law placing limits upon political expenditures, contains a constitutional flaw, since it merely permits, but does not require, prosecution.  The prophylaxis achieved by insisting upon a rigid, no-waiver application of the ordinance requirements would be far outweighed, we think, by the accompanying senseless prohibition of speech (and of other activity in the park) by organizations that fail to meet the technical requirements of the ordinance but for one reason or another pose no risk of the evils that those requirements are designed to avoid.  On balance, we think the permissive nature of the ordinance furthers, rather than constricts, free speech.

				Respondent, the Chicago Park District (Park District), is responsible for operating public parks and other public property in Chicago.  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 70, &#xA7;1505/7.01 (2001).  Pursuant to its authority to &#x93;establish by ordinance all needful rules and regulations for the government and protection of parks &#x2026; and other property under its jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1505/7.02, the Park District adopted an ordinance that requires a person to obtain a permit in order to &#x93;conduct a public assembly, parade, picnic, or other event involving more than fifty individuals,&#x94; or engage in an activity such as &#x93;creat[ing] or emit[ting] any Amplified Sound.&#x94;  Chicago Park Dist. Code, ch. VII, &#xA7;&#xA7;C.3.a(1), C.3.a(6).  The ordinance provides that &#x93;[a]pplications for permits shall be processed in order of receipt,&#x94; &#xA7;C.5.a, and the Park District must decide whether to grant or deny an application within 14 days unless, by written notice to the applicant, it extends the period an additional 14 days, &#xA7;C.5.c.  Applications can be denied on any of 13 specified grounds.  &#xA7;C.5.e.

, we confronted a state law that enacted a strikingly similar system of prior restraint for motion pictures.  It required that every motion picture film be submitted to a Board of Censors before the film was shown anywhere in the State.  The Board enjoyed authority to reject films that it considered &#x93; &#x91;obscene&#x92; &#x94; or that &#x93; &#x91;tend[ed], in the judgment of the Board, to debase or corrupt morals or incite to crimes,&#x92; &#x94; characteristics defined by the statute in broad terms.

				Petitioners contend that the Park District, like the Board of Censors in

				</em>
				, must initiate litigation every time it denies a permit and that the ordinance must specify a deadline for judicial review of a challenge to a permit denial.  We reject those contentions.  
				<em>
					Freedman
				</em>
				 is inapposite because the licensing scheme at issue here is not subject-matter censorship but content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation of the use of a public forum.  The Park District&#x92;s ordinance does not authorize a licensor to pass judgment on the content of speech: None of the grounds for denying a permit has anything to do with what a speaker might say.  Indeed, the ordinance (unlike the classic censorship scheme) is not even directed to communicative activity as such, but rather to 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 activity conducted in a public park.  The picnicker and soccer-player, no less than the political activist or parade marshal, must apply for a permit if the 50-person limit is to be exceeded.  And the object of the permit system (as plainly indicated by the permissible grounds for permit denial) is not to exclude communication of a particular content, but to coordinate multiple uses of limited space, to assure preservation of the park facilities, to prevent uses that are dangerous, unlawful, or impermissible under the Park District&#x92;s rules, and to assure financial accountability for damage caused by the event.  As the Court of Appeals well put it: &#x93;[T]o allow unregulated access to all comers could easily reduce rather than enlarge the park&#x92;s utility as a forum for speech.&#x94;  227 F. 3d 921, 924 (CA7 2000).

				Of course even content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions can be applied in such a manner as to stifle free expression.  Where the licensing official enjoys unduly broad discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a permit, there is a risk that he will favor or disfavor speech based on its content.  See 
				<em>
					Forsyth County

				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">131</a> (1992)

				<em>

				We think not.  As we have described, the Park District may deny a permit only for one or more of the reasons set forth in the ordinance.  See n. 1, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				.  It may deny, for example, when the application is incomplete or contains a material falsehood or misrepresentation; when the applicant has damaged Park District property on prior occasions and has not paid for the damage; when a permit has been granted to an earlier applicant for the same time and place; when the intended use would present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety of park users or Park District employees; or when the applicant has violated the terms of a prior permit.  See Chicago Park Dist. Code, ch. VII, &#xA7;C.5.e.  Moreover, the Park District must process applications within 28 days, &#xA7;C.5.c, and must clearly explain its reasons for any denial, &#xA7;C.5.e.

				Petitioners contend that the criteria set forth in the ordinance are insufficiently precise because they are described as grounds on which the Park District &#x93;may&#x94; deny a permit, rather than grounds on which it 
				<em>
					must
				</em>
				 do so.  This, they contend, allows the Park District to waive the permit requirements for some favored speakers, while insisting upon them for others.  That is certainly not the intent of the ordinance, which the Park District has reasonably interpreted to permit overlooking only those inadequacies that, under the circumstances, do no harm to the policies furthered by the application requirements.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31&#x96;32.  Granting waivers to favored speakers (or, more precisely, denying them to disfavored speakers) would of course be unconstitutional, but we think that this abuse must be dealt with if and when a pattern of unlawful favoritism appears, rather than by insisting upon a degree of rigidity that is found in few legal arrangements.  On petitioners&#x92; theory, every obscenity law, or every law placing limits upon political expenditures, contains a constitutional flaw, since it merely permits, but does not require, prosecution.  The prophylaxis achieved by insisting upon a rigid, no-waiver application of the ordinance requirements would be far outweighed, we think, by the accompanying senseless prohibition of speech (and of other activity in the park) by organizations that fail to meet the technical requirements of the ordinance but for one reason or another pose no risk of the evils that those requirements are designed to avoid.  On balance, we think the permissive nature of the ordinance furthers, rather than constricts, free speech.

				Respondent, the Chicago Park District (Park District), is responsible for operating public parks and other public property in Chicago.  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 70, &#xA7;1505/7.01 (2001).  Pursuant to its authority to &#x93;establish by ordinance all needful rules and regulations for the government and protection of parks &#x2026; and other property under its jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1505/7.02, the Park District adopted an ordinance that requires a person to obtain a permit in order to &#x93;conduct a public assembly, parade, picnic, or other event involving more than fifty individuals,&#x94; or engage in an activity such as &#x93;creat[ing] or emit[ting] any Amplified Sound.&#x94;  Chicago Park Dist. Code, ch. VII, &#xA7;&#xA7;C.3.a(1), C.3.a(6).  The ordinance provides that &#x93;[a]pplications for permits shall be processed in order of receipt,&#x94; &#xA7;C.5.a, and the Park District must decide whether to grant or deny an application within 14 days unless, by written notice to the applicant, it extends the period an additional 14 days, &#xA7;C.5.c.  Applications can be denied on any of 13 specified grounds.  &#xA7;C.5.e.

, we confronted a state law that enacted a strikingly similar system of prior restraint for motion pictures.  It required that every motion picture film be submitted to a Board of Censors before the film was shown anywhere in the State.  The Board enjoyed authority to reject films that it considered &#x93; &#x91;obscene&#x92; &#x94; or that &#x93; &#x91;tend[ed], in the judgment of the Board, to debase or corrupt morals or incite to crimes,&#x92; &#x94; characteristics defined by the statute in broad terms.

				Petitioners contend that the Park District, like the Board of Censors in

				, must initiate litigation every time it denies a permit and that the ordinance must specify a deadline for judicial review of a challenge to a permit denial.  We reject those contentions.  
				<em>
					Freedman
				</em>
				 is inapposite because the licensing scheme at issue here is not subject-matter censorship but content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation of the use of a public forum.  The Park District&#x92;s ordinance does not authorize a licensor to pass judgment on the content of speech: None of the grounds for denying a permit has anything to do with what a speaker might say.  Indeed, the ordinance (unlike the classic censorship scheme) is not even directed to communicative activity as such, but rather to 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 activity conducted in a public park.  The picnicker and soccer-player, no less than the political activist or parade marshal, must apply for a permit if the 50-person limit is to be exceeded.  And the object of the permit system (as plainly indicated by the permissible grounds for permit denial) is not to exclude communication of a particular content, but to coordinate multiple uses of limited space, to assure preservation of the park facilities, to prevent uses that are dangerous, unlawful, or impermissible under the Park District&#x92;s rules, and to assure financial accountability for damage caused by the event.  As the Court of Appeals well put it: &#x93;[T]o allow unregulated access to all comers could easily reduce rather than enlarge the park&#x92;s utility as a forum for speech.&#x94;  227 F. 3d 921, 924 (CA7 2000).

				Of course even content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions can be applied in such a manner as to stifle free expression.  Where the licensing official enjoys unduly broad discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a permit, there is a risk that he will favor or disfavor speech based on its content.  See 
				<em>
					Forsyth County

				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">131</a> (1992)

				<em>

				</em>

				We think not.  As we have described, the Park District may deny a permit only for one or more of the reasons set forth in the ordinance.  See n. 1, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				.  It may deny, for example, when the application is incomplete or contains a material falsehood or misrepresentation; when the applicant has damaged Park District property on prior occasions and has not paid for the damage; when a permit has been granted to an earlier applicant for the same time and place; when the intended use would present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety of park users or Park District employees; or when the applicant has violated the terms of a prior permit.  See Chicago Park Dist. Code, ch. VII, &#xA7;C.5.e.  Moreover, the Park District must process applications within 28 days, &#xA7;C.5.c, and must clearly explain its reasons for any denial, &#xA7;C.5.e.

				Petitioners contend that the criteria set forth in the ordinance are insufficiently precise because they are described as grounds on which the Park District &#x93;may&#x94; deny a permit, rather than grounds on which it 
				<em>
					must
				</em>
				 do so.  This, they contend, allows the Park District to waive the permit requirements for some favored speakers, while insisting upon them for others.  That is certainly not the intent of the ordinance, which the Park District has reasonably interpreted to permit overlooking only those inadequacies that, under the circumstances, do no harm to the policies furthered by the application requirements.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31&#x96;32.  Granting waivers to favored speakers (or, more precisely, denying them to disfavored speakers) would of course be unconstitutional, but we think that this abuse must be dealt with if and when a pattern of unlawful favoritism appears, rather than by insisting upon a degree of rigidity that is found in few legal arrangements.  On petitioners&#x92; theory, every obscenity law, or every law placing limits upon political expenditures, contains a constitutional flaw, since it merely permits, but does not require, prosecution.  The prophylaxis achieved by insisting upon a rigid, no-waiver application of the ordinance requirements would be far outweighed, we think, by the accompanying senseless prohibition of speech (and of other activity in the park) by organizations that fail to meet the technical requirements of the ordinance but for one reason or another pose no risk of the evils that those requirements are designed to avoid.  On balance, we think the permissive nature of the ordinance furthers, rather than constricts, free speech.

&#x93;(4)the applicant is legally incompetent to contract or to sue and be sued;


&#x93;(5)the applicant or the person on whose behalf the application for permit was made has on prior occasions damaged Park District property and has not paid in full for such damage, or has other outstanding and unpaid debts to the Park District;


&#x93;(6)a fully executed prior application for permit for the same time and place has been received, and a permit has been or will be granted to a prior applicant authorizing uses or activities which do not reasonably permit multiple occupancy of the particular park or part hereof;

&#x93;(8)the proposed use or activity is prohibited by or inconsistent with the classifications and uses of the park or part thereof designated pursuant to this chapter, Section C.1., above;

				Respondent, the Chicago Park District (Park District), is responsible for operating public parks and other public property in Chicago.  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 70, &#xA7;1505/7.01 (2001).  Pursuant to its authority to &#x93;establish by ordinance all needful rules and regulations for the government and protection of parks &#x2026; and other property under its jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1505/7.02, the Park District adopted an ordinance that requires a person to obtain a permit in order to &#x93;conduct a public assembly, parade, picnic, or other event involving more than fifty individuals,&#x94; or engage in an activity such as &#x93;creat[ing] or emit[ting] any Amplified Sound.&#x94;  Chicago Park Dist. Code, ch. VII, &#xA7;&#xA7;C.3.a(1), C.3.a(6).  The ordinance provides that &#x93;[a]pplications for permits shall be processed in order of receipt,&#x94; &#xA7;C.5.a, and the Park District must decide whether to grant or deny an application within 14 days unless, by written notice to the applicant, it extends the period an additional 14 days, &#xA7;C.5.c.  Applications can be denied on any of 13 specified grounds.  &#xA7;C.5.e.

, we confronted a state law that enacted a strikingly similar system of prior restraint for motion pictures.  It required that every motion picture film be submitted to a Board of Censors before the film was shown anywhere in the State.  The Board enjoyed authority to reject films that it considered &#x93; &#x91;obscene&#x92; &#x94; or that &#x93; &#x91;tend[ed], in the judgment of the Board, to debase or corrupt morals or incite to crimes,&#x92; &#x94; characteristics defined by the statute in broad terms.

				Petitioners contend that the Park District, like the Board of Censors in

				, must initiate litigation every time it denies a permit and that the ordinance must specify a deadline for judicial review of a challenge to a permit denial.  We reject those contentions.  
				<em>
					Freedman
				</em>
				 is inapposite because the licensing scheme at issue here is not subject-matter censorship but content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation of the use of a public forum.  The Park District&#x92;s ordinance does not authorize a licensor to pass judgment on the content of speech: None of the grounds for denying a permit has anything to do with what a speaker might say.  Indeed, the ordinance (unlike the classic censorship scheme) is not even directed to communicative activity as such, but rather to 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 activity conducted in a public park.  The picnicker and soccer-player, no less than the political activist or parade marshal, must apply for a permit if the 50-person limit is to be exceeded.  And the object of the permit system (as plainly indicated by the permissible grounds for permit denial) is not to exclude communication of a particular content, but to coordinate multiple uses of limited space, to assure preservation of the park facilities, to prevent uses that are dangerous, unlawful, or impermissible under the Park District&#x92;s rules, and to assure financial accountability for damage caused by the event.  As the Court of Appeals well put it: &#x93;[T]o allow unregulated access to all comers could easily reduce rather than enlarge the park&#x92;s utility as a forum for speech.&#x94;  227 F. 3d 921, 924 (CA7 2000).

				Of course even content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions can be applied in such a manner as to stifle free expression.  Where the licensing official enjoys unduly broad discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a permit, there is a risk that he will favor or disfavor speech based on its content.  See

				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">131</a> (1992)

				<em>

				</em>

				We think not.  As we have described, the Park District may deny a permit only for one or more of the reasons set forth in the ordinance.  See n. 1, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				.  It may deny, for example, when the application is incomplete or contains a material falsehood or misrepresentation; when the applicant has damaged Park District property on prior occasions and has not paid for the damage; when a permit has been granted to an earlier applicant for the same time and place; when the intended use would present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety of park users or Park District employees; or when the applicant has violated the terms of a prior permit.  See Chicago Park Dist. Code, ch. VII, &#xA7;C.5.e.  Moreover, the Park District must process applications within 28 days, &#xA7;C.5.c, and must clearly explain its reasons for any denial, &#xA7;C.5.e.
				<em>

				Petitioners contend that the criteria set forth in the ordinance are insufficiently precise because they are described as grounds on which the Park District &#x93;may&#x94; deny a permit, rather than grounds on which it 
				<em>
					must
				</em>
				 do so.  This, they contend, allows the Park District to waive the permit requirements for some favored speakers, while insisting upon them for others.  That is certainly not the intent of the ordinance, which the Park District has reasonably interpreted to permit overlooking only those inadequacies that, under the circumstances, do no harm to the policies furthered by the application requirements.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31&#x96;32.  Granting waivers to favored speakers (or, more precisely, denying them to disfavored speakers) would of course be unconstitutional, but we think that this abuse must be dealt with if and when a pattern of unlawful favoritism appears, rather than by insisting upon a degree of rigidity that is found in few legal arrangements.  On petitioners&#x92; theory, every obscenity law, or every law placing limits upon political expenditures, contains a constitutional flaw, since it merely permits, but does not require, prosecution.  The prophylaxis achieved by insisting upon a rigid, no-waiver application of the ordinance requirements would be far outweighed, we think, by the accompanying senseless prohibition of speech (and of other activity in the park) by organizations that fail to meet the technical requirements of the ordinance but for one reason or another pose no risk of the evils that those requirements are designed to avoid.  On balance, we think the permissive nature of the ordinance furthers, rather than constricts, free speech.

&#x93;(1)the application for permit (including any required attachments and submissions) is not fully completed and executed;


&#x93;(2)the applicant has not tendered the required application fee with the application or has not tendered the required user fee, indemnification agreement, insurance certificate, or security deposit within the times prescribed by the General Superintendent;


&#x93;(3)the application for permit contains a material falsehood or misrepresentation;


&#x93;(4)the applicant is legally incompetent to contract or to sue and be sued;


&#x93;(5)the applicant or the person on whose behalf the application for permit was made has on prior occasions damaged Park District property and has not paid in full for such damage, or has other outstanding and unpaid debts to the Park District;

				Respondent, the Chicago Park District (Park District), is responsible for operating public parks and other public property in Chicago.  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 70, &#xA7;1505/7.01 (2001).  Pursuant to its authority to &#x93;establish by ordinance all needful rules and regulations for the government and protection of parks &#x2026; and other property under its jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1505/7.02, the Park District adopted an ordinance that requires a person to obtain a permit in order to &#x93;conduct a public assembly, parade, picnic, or other event involving more than fifty individuals,&#x94; or engage in an activity such as &#x93;creat[ing] or emit[ting] any Amplified Sound.&#x94;  Chicago Park Dist. Code, ch. VII, &#xA7;&#xA7;C.3.a(1), C.3.a(6).  The ordinance provides that &#x93;[a]pplications for permits shall be processed in order of receipt,&#x94; &#xA7;C.5.a, and the Park District must decide whether to grant or deny an application within 14 days unless, by written notice to the applicant, it extends the period an additional 14 days, &#xA7;C.5.c.  Applications can be denied on any of 13 specified grounds.  &#xA7;C.5.e.

, we confronted a state law that enacted a strikingly similar system of prior restraint for motion pictures.  It required that every motion picture film be submitted to a Board of Censors before the film was shown anywhere in the State.  The Board enjoyed authority to reject films that it considered &#x93; &#x91;obscene&#x92; &#x94; or that &#x93; &#x91;tend[ed], in the judgment of the Board, to debase or corrupt morals or incite to crimes,&#x92; &#x94; characteristics defined by the statute in broad terms.

				</em>
				 at 52, n. 2.  The statute punished the exhibition of a film not submitted to the Board for advance approval, even where the film would have received a license had it been properly submitted.  It was no defense that the content of the film was protected by the

				Petitioners contend that the Park District, like the Board of Censors in 
				<em>

				</em>
				, must initiate litigation every time it denies a permit and that the ordinance must specify a deadline for judicial review of a challenge to a permit denial.  We reject those contentions.  
				<em>
					Freedman
				</em>
				 is inapposite because the licensing scheme at issue here is not subject-matter censorship but content-neutral time, place, and manner regulation of the use of a public forum.  The Park District&#x92;s ordinance does not authorize a licensor to pass judgment on the content of speech: None of the grounds for denying a permit has anything to do with what a speaker might say.  Indeed, the ordinance (unlike the classic censorship scheme) is not even directed to communicative activity as such, but rather to 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 activity conducted in a public park.  The picnicker and soccer-player, no less than the political activist or parade marshal, must apply for a permit if the 50-person limit is to be exceeded.  And the object of the permit system (as plainly indicated by the permissible grounds for permit denial) is not to exclude communication of a particular content, but to coordinate multiple uses of limited space, to assure preservation of the park facilities, to prevent uses that are dangerous, unlawful, or impermissible under the Park District&#x92;s rules, and to assure financial accountability for damage caused by the event.  As the Court of Appeals well put it: &#x93;[T]o allow unregulated access to all comers could easily reduce rather than enlarge the park&#x92;s utility as a forum for speech.&#x94;  227 F. 3d 921, 924 (CA7 2000).

				Of course even content-neutral time, place, and manner restrictions can be applied in such a manner as to stifle free expression.  Where the licensing official enjoys unduly broad discretion in determining whether to grant or deny a permit, there is a risk that he will favor or disfavor speech based on its content.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">131</a> (1992)

				<em>

				We think not.  As we have described, the Park District may deny a permit only for one or more of the reasons set forth in the ordinance.  See n. 1, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				.  It may deny, for example, when the application is incomplete or contains a material falsehood or misrepresentation; when the applicant has damaged Park District property on prior occasions and has not paid for the damage; when a permit has been granted to an earlier applicant for the same time and place; when the intended use would present an unreasonable danger to the health or safety of park users or Park District employees; or when the applicant has violated the terms of a prior permit.  See Chicago Park Dist. Code, ch. VII, &#xA7;C.5.e.  Moreover, the Park District must process applications within 28 days, &#xA7;C.5.c, and must clearly explain its reasons for any denial, &#xA7;C.5.e.
				<em>

				Petitioners contend that the criteria set forth in the ordinance are insufficiently precise because they are described as grounds on which the Park District &#x93;may&#x94; deny a permit, rather than grounds on which it 
				<em>
					must
				</em>
				 do so.  This, they contend, allows the Park District to waive the permit requirements for some favored speakers, while insisting upon them for others.  That is certainly not the intent of the ordinance, which the Park District has reasonably interpreted to permit overlooking only those inadequacies that, under the circumstances, do no harm to the policies furthered by the application requirements.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31&#x96;32.  Granting waivers to favored speakers (or, more precisely, denying them to disfavored speakers) would of course be unconstitutional, but we think that this abuse must be dealt with if and when a pattern of unlawful favoritism appears, rather than by insisting upon a degree of rigidity that is found in few legal arrangements.  On petitioners&#x92; theory, every obscenity law, or every law placing limits upon political expenditures, contains a constitutional flaw, since it merely permits, but does not require, prosecution.  The prophylaxis achieved by insisting upon a rigid, no-waiver application of the ordinance requirements would be far outweighed, we think, by the accompanying senseless prohibition of speech (and of other activity in the park) by organizations that fail to meet the technical requirements of the ordinance but for one reason or another pose no risk of the evils that those requirements are designed to avoid.  On balance, we think the permissive nature of the ordinance furthers, rather than constricts, free speech.
