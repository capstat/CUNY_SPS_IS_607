				Federal preemption prescriptions relating to motor carriers, contained in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/49/14501.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">49 U. S. C. &#xA7;14501(c)</a> (1994 ed., Supp. V), specifically save to States &#x93;safety regulatory authority &#x2026; with respect to motor vehicles,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  This case presents the question whether the state power preserved in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) may be delegated to munici-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				palities, permitting them to exercise safety regulatory authority over local tow-truck operations.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The federal legislation preempts provisions by &#x93;a State [or] political subdivision of a State &#x2026; related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; with respect to the transportation of property.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(1).  As an exception to this general rule, Congress provided that the preemption directive &#x93;shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State with respect to motor vehicles.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  Section 14501(c)(1)&#x92;s statement of the general rule explicitly includes &#x93;State[s]&#x94; and their &#x93;political subdivision[s].&#x94;  The exception for safety regulation, however, specifies only &#x93;State[s]&#x94; and does not mention &#x93;political subdivision[s].&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We hold that &#xA7;14501(c) does not bar a State from delegating to municipalities and other local units the State&#x92;s authority to establish safety regulations governing motor carriers of property, including tow trucks.  A locality, as &#xA7;14501(c) recognizes, is a &#x93;political 
				<em>
					subdivision
				</em>
				&#x94;
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				of the State.  Ordinarily, a political subdivision may exercise whatever portion of state power the State, under its own constitution and laws, chooses to delegate to the subdivision.  Absent a clear statement to the contrary, Congress&#x92; reference to the &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94; should be read to preserve, not preempt, the traditional prerogative of the States to delegate their authority to their constituent parts.

				Plaintiff-respondent Ours Garage and Wrecker Service, Inc., joined by a trade association of tow-truck operators, the Towing and Recovery Association of Ohio (TRAO), brought suit in Federal District Court against the City of Columbus and two city officials to enjoin enforcement of the City&#x92;s tow-truck regulations.

Here, the general preemption provision, &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x97;from which &#xA7;14501(c) (2)(A) excepts &#x93;the safety regulatory authority of a State&#x94;&#x97;explicitly preempts regulation both by &#x93;a State&#x94; and by a &#x93;political subdivision of a State.&#x94;  The exception for state safety regulation is the first in a series of four statutory exceptions to the preemption rule.  The third exception in the series, covering regulation of prices for nonconsensual tow-truck services, matches the general preemption provision; it explicitly applies to the &#x93;authority of a State or a political subdivision of a State.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C).  States and their political subdivisions are likewise linked in almost every other provision of &#xA7;14501.  See &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(a), 14501(b)(1), 14501(c)(3)(A), 14501(c)(3)(B), 14501(c)(3)(C).

				Respondents Ours Garage and TRAO, in line with several Courts of Appeals, home in on the statute&#x92;s repeated references to both States and their political subdivisions; in contrast, they urge, the singularly bare reference to &#x93;[s]tate&#x94; authority in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A)&#x92;s exception for safety regulation must mean that Congress intended to limit the exception to States alone.

				We acknowledge that &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s &#x93;disparate inclusion [and] exclusion&#x94; of the words &#x93;political subdivisions&#x94; support an argument of some force, one that could not have been made in

				Respondents Ours Garage and TRAO, as just noted, contrast the first statutory exception to &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s preemption rule, 
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 the exception preserving &#x93;the safety regulatory authority of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A), with the third exception, preserving the &#x93;authority of a State or a political subdivision to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision relating to the price&#x94; charged for nonconsensual towing, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C).  See Brief for Respondents 15&#x96;16.  The nonconsensual towing exception tracks the language and structure of the general preemption rule, omitting only the reference to a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;  Similarly styled, the fourth exception, for carrier-requested regulations in areas such as &#x93;uniform cargo liability&#x94; and antitrust immunity, &#xA7;14501(c)(3), completely parallels the wording of &#xA7;14501(c)(1): It provides that preemption &#x93;shall not affect any authority of a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of 2 or more States to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision&#x94; in those areas.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The safety exception of &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A), however, does not borrow language from &#xA7;14501(c)(1).  It simply states that preemption &#x93;shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Notably, the second statutory exception, on which respondents train no attention, is stated with similar economy.  That exception mentions neither States nor political subdivisions; it simply says that the general preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(1), &#x93;does not apply to the transportation of household goods,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B).  Yet it is abundantly clear that, notwithstanding this difference in verbal formulation, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), like its neighbor &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), permits both state and local regulation.

				The inclusion of the phrase &#x93;the authority of a State

				or a political subdivision of a State to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision&#x94; no doubt synchronizes the nonconsensual towing provision with &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s main rule.  The parallel structure of &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(c)(1)
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				and 14501(c)(2)(C) does not imply, however, that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A)&#x92;s concise statement must be read to use the term &#x93;State&#x94; restrictively.  Respondents&#x92; inference from the absence of &#x93;political subdivision of a State&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) would be more persuasive if the omission were the sole difference in the expression of the general rule and the safety exception.  In contrast to &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C) and (c)(3), however, neither the safety exception nor the household-goods exception refers to the &#x93;authority &#x2026; to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision.&#x94;

				  The

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Respondents&#x92; restrictive reading of the term &#x93;State,&#x94; we note, introduces an interpretive conundrum of another kind.  Section 14501(c)(1) preempts the power of both States and localities to &#x93;
				<em>
					enact or enforce
				</em>
				 a law, regulation, or other provision.&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  Those conjoined words travel together.  If, as Ours Garage and TRAO argue, the safety exception of &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) reaches only States, then localities are preempted not only from enacting, but equally from 
				<em>
					enforcing, 
				</em>
				safety regulations governing motor carriers of property&#x97;even if those regulations are enacted by the state legislature.  It is unlikely that Congress would preserve States&#x92; power to enact safety rules and, at the same time, bar the ordinary method by which States enforce such rules&#x97;through their local instrumentalities.

				Finally, we reiterate, reading the term &#x93;State&#x94; as used in &#xA7;14501 to exclude political  subdivisions would yield a decision at odds with our federal system&#x92;s traditional comprehension of &#x93;the safety regulatory authority of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).

				This case, by contrast, deals not with States&#x92; voluntary agreements to relinquish authority vis-&#xE0;-vis their political subdivisions in exchange for federal funds, but with preemption stemming from Congress&#x92; power to regulate commerce, in a field where States have traditionally allowed localities to address local concerns.  Congress&#x92; clear pur-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				pose in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) is to ensure that its preemption of States&#x92; economic authority over motor carriers of property, &#xA7;14501(c)(1), &#x93;not restrict&#x94; the preexisting and traditional state police power over safety.  That power typically includes the choice to delegate the State&#x92;s &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94; to localities.  Forcing a State to refrain from doing so would effectively &#x93;restrict&#x94; that very authority.  Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x93;clear and manifest purpose&#x94; to the contrary, federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.

				The Conference Report on the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 observed that &#x93;[s]tate economic regulation of motor carrier operations &#x2026; is a huge problem for national and regional carriers attempting to conduct a standard way of doing business.&#x94;  H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103&#x96;677, p. 87 (1994).  Carrying more weight, in the Act itself Congress reported its finding that &#x93;the regulation of intrastate transportation of property by the States&#x94; unreasonably burdened free trade, interstate commerce, and American consumers.  Pub. L. 103&#x96;305, &#xA7;601(a)(1),

1605.  Congress therefore concluded that &#x93;certain aspects of the State regulatory process should be preempted.&#x94; &#xA7;601(a)(2).  These declarations of deregulatory purpose, however, do not justify interpreting through a deregulatory prism &#x93;aspects of the State regu-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				latory process&#x94; that Congress determined should 
				<em>
					not 
				</em>
				be preempted.

				A congressional decision to enact both a general policy that furthers a particular goal and a specific exception that might tend against that goal does not invariably 
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				call for the narrowest possible construction of the exception.  Such a construction is surely resistible here, for &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s preemption rule and &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A)&#x92;s safety exception to it do not necessarily conflict.  The problem to which the congressional conferees attended was &#x93;[s]tate 
				<em>
					economic 
				</em>
				regulation&#x94;; the exemption in question is for state 
				<em>
					safety 
				</em>
				regulation.  Corroboratively, the measure&#x92;s legislative history shows that the deregulatory aim of the legislation had been endorsed by a key interest group&#x97;the American Trucking Association&#x97;subject to &#x93;some conditions that would allow regulatory protection to continue for non-economic factors, such as &#x2026; insurance [and] safety.&#x94;  H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103&#x96;677, at 88.  The conferees believed that the legislation &#x93;address[ed] these

				conditions.&#x94;

				The construction of &#xA7;14501 that respondents Ours Garage and TRAO advocate, moreover, does not guarantee uniform regulation.  On respondents&#x92; reading as on petitioners&#x92;, a State could, without affront to the statute, pass discrete, nonuniform safety regulations applicable to each of its several constituent municipalities.  Ohio thus could adopt the Columbus regulations to govern in that city, 
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				the Toledo regulations to govern there, and so on down
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				the line.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37&#x96;38.  Indeed, because &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) refers only to &#x93;political&#x94; subdivisions, nothing in the statute&#x92;s text would impede a State from creating an administrative agency organized into local offices, each of which could craft local rules suitable to its assigned jurisdiction.  There is no reason to suppose that Congress meant to stop the States from spreading their authority among municipalities unless they employ such artificial or inefficient schemes.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/49/31141.html" class="subref" title="subref">49 U. S. C. &#xA7;31141</a> (1994 ed.) affords the Secretary of Transportation a means to prevent the safety exception from overwhelming the lawmakers&#x92; deregulatory purpose.  That provision authorizes the Secretary to void any &#x93;State law or regulation on commercial motor vehi-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				cle safety&#x94; that, in the Secretary&#x92;s judgment, &#x93;has no safety benefit &#x2026; [or] would cause an unreasonable burden on interstate commerce.&#x94;  &#xA7;&#xA7;31141(a), (c)(4); see also &#xA7;31132(8) (&#x93; &#x91;State law&#x92; includes [for the purposes of &#xA7;31141] a law enacted by a political subdivision of a State&#x94;); &#xA7;31132(9) (parallel definition of &#x93;State regulation&#x94;).  Under this authority, the Secretary can in-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				validate local safety regulations upon finding that their content or multiplicity threatens to clog the avenues of commerce.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We reiterate that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) shields from preemption only &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94; (and &#x93;authority of a State to regulate &#x2026; with regard to minimum amounts of financial responsibility relating to insurance requirements&#x94;).  Local regulation of prices, routes, or services of tow trucks that is not genuinely responsive to safety concerns garners no exemption from &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s preemption rule.

						 The dissent insists that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B) is irrelevant because its phrasing &#x93;ha[s] nothing to do with the issue of separating State and local authority.&#x94;  Post, at 5 (emphasis omitted).  We ultimately draw the same conclusion, of course, regarding the phrasing of the safety exception in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  The dissent, although it urges that &#x93;we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear,&#x94; post, at 5&#x96;6, rests upon the fact that subdivisions of States do not appear in the safety exception&#x97;as they also do not in the household-goods exception of &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B).  That &#xA7;14501(c)(2) comprises three exceptions, each differently stated, seems to us indeed relevant to the interpretive weight that may be attached to the variation among them.

						 Faced with this argument, the dissent is converted, however temporarily, to the view that &#x93;federal interference with the &#x91;historic powers of the States&#x92; must be evinced by a &#x91;plain statement.&#x92; &#x94;  Post, at 8&#x96;9, n. 4 (quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/501/452" class="subref" title="subref">501 U. S. 452</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">461</a> (1991)
).  The dissent finds no plain statement in &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s prohibition on local enforcement because it can be read to mean only that &#x93;a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws&#x94; relating to motor carriage of property.  Ibid.  This is by no means the most natural reading of the preemption provision.  The suggestion of the dissent is that, as applied to localities, &#xA7;14501(c)(1) preempts only local enforcement of locally enacted laws.  See ibid.  This interpretation raises the startling possibility that, although &#xA7;14501(c)(1) forbids both States and localities from &#x93;enact[ing]&#x94; new laws, it permits localities (but not States) to enforce previously enacted state laws relating to motor carriage of property.

						 Nor, the dissent&#x92;s suggestion notwithstanding, see post, at 7, is &#xA7;14501 similar to the Clean Air Act, which mandates that States undertake an environmental planning process that of necessity cannot respect local political boundaries.  See

Even so, States may delegate implementation authority under the Clean Air Act to their political subdivisions, subject to the requirement that the State bear ultimate oversight responsibility.  See &#xA7;7410(a)(2)(E)(iii) (State must provide &#x93;necessary assurances that, where the State has relied on a local or regional government, agency, or instrumentality for the implementation of any [state] plan provision, the State has responsibility for ensuring adequate implementation of such plan provision&#x94;).

This case presents the question whether the state power preserved in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) may be delegated to munici-

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The federal legislation preempts provisions by &#x93;a State [or] political subdivision of a State &#x2026; related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; with respect to the transportation of property.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(1).  As an exception to this general rule, Congress provided that the preemption directive &#x93;shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State with respect to motor vehicles.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  Section 14501(c)(1)&#x92;s statement of the general rule explicitly includes &#x93;State[s]&#x94; and their &#x93;political subdivision[s].&#x94;  The exception for safety regulation, however, specifies only &#x93;State[s]&#x94; and does not mention &#x93;political subdivision[s].&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We hold that &#xA7;14501(c) does not bar a State from delegating to municipalities and other local units the State&#x92;s authority to establish safety regulations governing motor carriers of property, including tow trucks.  A locality, as &#xA7;14501(c) recognizes, is a &#x93;political 
				<em>
					subdivision
				</em>
				&#x94;
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				of the State.  Ordinarily, a political subdivision may exercise whatever portion of state power the State, under its own constitution and laws, chooses to delegate to the subdivision.  Absent a clear statement to the contrary, Congress&#x92; reference to the &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94; should be read to preserve, not preempt, the traditional prerogative of the States to delegate their authority to their constituent parts.

				This case is a closer call than

				</em>
				.  Here, the general preemption provision, &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x97;from which &#xA7;14501(c) (2)(A) excepts &#x93;the safety regulatory authority of a State&#x94;&#x97;explicitly preempts regulation both by &#x93;a State&#x94; and by a &#x93;political subdivision of a State.&#x94;  The exception for state safety regulation is the first in a series of four statutory exceptions to the preemption rule.  The third exception in the series, covering regulation of prices for nonconsensual tow-truck services, matches the general preemption provision; it explicitly applies to the &#x93;authority of a State or a political subdivision of a State.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C).  States and their political subdivisions are likewise linked in almost every other provision of &#xA7;14501.  See &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(a), 14501(b)(1), 14501(c)(3)(A), 14501(c)(3)(B), 14501(c)(3)(C).

				Respondents Ours Garage and TRAO, in line with several Courts of Appeals, home in on the statute&#x92;s repeated references to both States and their political subdivisions; in contrast, they urge, the singularly bare reference to &#x93;[s]tate&#x94; authority in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A)&#x92;s exception for safety regulation must mean that Congress intended to limit the exception to States alone.  See Brief for Respondents 15&#x96;16, 26&#x96;29.  Respondents rely particularly on

				We acknowledge that &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s &#x93;disparate inclusion [and] exclusion&#x94; of the words &#x93;political subdivisions&#x94; support an argument of some force, one that could not have been made in

				Respondents Ours Garage and TRAO, as just noted, contrast the first statutory exception to &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s preemption rule, 
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 the exception preserving &#x93;the safety regulatory authority of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A), with the third exception, preserving the &#x93;authority of a State or a political subdivision to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision relating to the price&#x94; charged for nonconsensual towing, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C).  See Brief for Respondents 15&#x96;16.  The nonconsensual towing exception tracks the language and structure of the general preemption rule, omitting only the reference to a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;  Similarly styled, the fourth exception, for carrier-requested regulations in areas such as &#x93;uniform cargo liability&#x94; and antitrust immunity, &#xA7;14501(c)(3), completely parallels the wording of &#xA7;14501(c)(1): It provides that preemption &#x93;shall not affect any authority of a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of 2 or more States to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision&#x94; in those areas.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The safety exception of &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A), however, does not borrow language from &#xA7;14501(c)(1).  It simply states that preemption &#x93;shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Notably, the second statutory exception, on which respondents train no attention, is stated with similar economy.  That exception mentions neither States nor political subdivisions; it simply says that the general preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(1), &#x93;does not apply to the transportation of household goods,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B).  Yet it is abundantly clear that, notwithstanding this difference in verbal formulation, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), like its neighbor &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), permits both state and local regulation.

				The inclusion of the phrase &#x93;the authority of a State

				or a political subdivision of a State to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision&#x94; no doubt synchronizes the nonconsensual towing provision with &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s main rule.  The parallel structure of &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(c)(1)
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				and 14501(c)(2)(C) does not imply, however, that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A)&#x92;s concise statement must be read to use the term &#x93;State&#x94; restrictively.  Respondents&#x92; inference from the absence of &#x93;political subdivision of a State&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) would be more persuasive if the omission were the sole difference in the expression of the general rule and the safety exception.  In contrast to &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C) and (c)(3), however, neither the safety exception nor the household-goods exception refers to the &#x93;authority &#x2026; to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision.&#x94;

				  The

				Respondents&#x92; restrictive reading of the term &#x93;State,&#x94; we note, introduces an interpretive conundrum of another kind.  Section 14501(c)(1) preempts the power of both States and localities to &#x93;
				<em>
					enact or enforce
				</em>
				 a law, regulation, or other provision.&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  Those conjoined words travel together.  If, as Ours Garage and TRAO argue, the safety exception of &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) reaches only States, then localities are preempted not only from enacting, but equally from 
				<em>
					enforcing, 
				</em>
				safety regulations governing motor carriers of property&#x97;even if those regulations are enacted by the state legislature.  It is unlikely that Congress would preserve States&#x92; power to enact safety rules and, at the same time, bar the ordinary method by which States enforce such rules&#x97;through their local instrumentalities.

				Finally, we reiterate, reading the term &#x93;State&#x94; as used in &#xA7;14501 to exclude political  subdivisions would yield a decision at odds with our federal system&#x92;s traditional comprehension of &#x93;the safety regulatory authority of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).

				This case, by contrast, deals not with States&#x92; voluntary agreements to relinquish authority vis-&#xE0;-vis their political subdivisions in exchange for federal funds, but with preemption stemming from Congress&#x92; power to regulate commerce, in a field where States have traditionally allowed localities to address local concerns.  Congress&#x92; clear pur-

				pose in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) is to ensure that its preemption of States&#x92; economic authority over motor carriers of property, &#xA7;14501(c)(1), &#x93;not restrict&#x94; the preexisting and traditional state police power over safety.  That power typically includes the choice to delegate the State&#x92;s &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94; to localities.  Forcing a State to refrain from doing so would effectively &#x93;restrict&#x94; that very authority.  Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x93;clear and manifest purpose&#x94; to the contrary, federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.

				The Conference Report on the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 observed that &#x93;[s]tate economic regulation of motor carrier operations &#x2026; is a huge problem for national and regional carriers attempting to conduct a standard way of doing business.&#x94;  H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103&#x96;677, p. 87 (1994).  Carrying more weight, in the Act itself Congress reported its finding that &#x93;the regulation of intrastate transportation of property by the States&#x94; unreasonably burdened free trade, interstate commerce, and American consumers.

1605.  Congress therefore concluded that &#x93;certain aspects of the State regulatory process should be preempted.&#x94; &#xA7;601(a)(2).  These declarations of deregulatory purpose, however, do not justify interpreting through a deregulatory prism &#x93;aspects of the State regu-

				A congressional decision to enact both a general policy that furthers a particular goal and a specific exception that might tend against that goal does not invariably

Such a construction is surely resistible here, for &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s preemption rule and &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A)&#x92;s safety exception to it do not necessarily conflict.

				The construction of &#xA7;14501 that respondents Ours Garage and TRAO advocate, moreover, does not guarantee uniform regulation.  On respondents&#x92; reading as on petitioners&#x92;, a State could, without affront to the statute, pass discrete, nonuniform safety regulations applicable to each of its several constituent municipalities.  Ohio thus could adopt the Columbus regulations to govern in that city, 
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				the Toledo regulations to govern there, and so on down
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				the line.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37&#x96;38.  Indeed, because &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) refers only to &#x93;political&#x94; subdivisions, nothing in the statute&#x92;s text would impede a State from creating an administrative agency organized into local offices, each of which could craft local rules suitable to its assigned jurisdiction.  There is no reason to suppose that Congress meant to stop the States from spreading their authority among municipalities unless they employ such artificial or inefficient schemes.

Local regulation of prices, routes, or services of tow trucks that is not genuinely responsive to safety concerns garners no exemption from &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s preemption rule.

						 The dissent insists that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B) is irrelevant because its phrasing &#x93;ha[s] nothing to do with the issue of separating State and local authority.&#x94;  Post, at 5 (emphasis omitted).  We ultimately draw the same conclusion, of course, regarding the phrasing of the safety exception in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  The dissent, although it urges that &#x93;we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear,&#x94; post, at 5&#x96;6, rests upon the fact that subdivisions of States do not appear in the safety exception&#x97;as they also do not in the household-goods exception of &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B).  That &#xA7;14501(c)(2) comprises three exceptions, each differently stated, seems to us indeed relevant to the interpretive weight that may be attached to the variation among them.

						 Faced with this argument, the dissent is converted, however temporarily, to the view that &#x93;federal interference with the &#x91;historic powers of the States&#x92; must be evinced by a &#x91;plain statement.&#x92; &#x94;  Post, at 8&#x96;9, n. 4 (quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">461</a> (1991)
).  The dissent finds no plain statement in &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s prohibition on local enforcement because it can be read to mean only that &#x93;a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws&#x94; relating to motor carriage of property.  Ibid.  This is by no means the most natural reading of the preemption provision.  The suggestion of the dissent is that, as applied to localities, &#xA7;14501(c)(1) preempts only local enforcement of locally enacted laws.  See ibid.  This interpretation raises the startling possibility that, although &#xA7;14501(c)(1) forbids both States and localities from &#x93;enact[ing]&#x94; new laws, it permits localities (but not States) to enforce previously enacted state laws relating to motor carriage of property.

						 Nor, the dissent&#x92;s suggestion notwithstanding, see post, at 7, is &#xA7;14501 similar to the Clean Air Act, which mandates that States undertake an environmental planning process that of necessity cannot respect local political boundaries.  See

Even so, States may delegate implementation authority under the Clean Air Act to their political subdivisions, subject to the requirement that the State bear ultimate oversight responsibility.

				Federal preemption prescriptions relating to motor carriers, contained in 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/49/14501.html#c" class="subref" title="subref">49 U. S. C. &#xA7;14501(c)</a> (1994 ed., Supp. V), specifically save to States &#x93;safety regulatory authority &#x2026; with respect to motor vehicles,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  This case presents the question whether the state power preserved in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) may be delegated to munici-

				palities, permitting them to exercise safety regulatory authority over local tow-truck operations.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The federal legislation preempts provisions by &#x93;a State [or] political subdivision of a State &#x2026; related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; with respect to the transportation of property.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(1).  As an exception to this general rule, Congress provided that the preemption directive &#x93;shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State with respect to motor vehicles.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  Section 14501(c)(1)&#x92;s statement of the general rule explicitly includes &#x93;State[s]&#x94; and their &#x93;political subdivision[s].&#x94;  The exception for safety regulation, however, specifies only &#x93;State[s]&#x94; and does not mention &#x93;political subdivision[s].&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We hold that &#xA7;14501(c) does not bar a State from delegating to municipalities and other local units the State&#x92;s authority to establish safety regulations governing motor carriers of property, including tow trucks.  A locality, as &#xA7;14501(c) recognizes, is a &#x93;political 
				<em>
					subdivision
				</em>
				&#x94;
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				of the State.  Ordinarily, a political subdivision may exercise whatever portion of state power the State, under its own constitution and laws, chooses to delegate to the subdivision.  Absent a clear statement to the contrary, Congress&#x92; reference to the &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94; should be read to preserve, not preempt, the traditional prerogative of the States to delegate their authority to their constituent parts.

				Plaintiff-respondent Ours Garage and Wrecker Service, Inc., joined by a trade association of tow-truck operators, the Towing and Recovery Association of Ohio (TRAO), brought suit in Federal District Court against the City of Columbus and two city officials to enjoin enforcement of the City&#x92;s tow-truck regulations.

				Respondents Ours Garage and TRAO, as just noted, contrast the first statutory exception to &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s preemption rule, 
				<em>

				 the exception preserving &#x93;the safety regulatory authority of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A), with the third exception, preserving the &#x93;authority of a State or a political subdivision to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision relating to the price&#x94; charged for nonconsensual towing, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C).  See Brief for Respondents 15&#x96;16.  The nonconsensual towing exception tracks the language and structure of the general preemption rule, omitting only the reference to a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;  Similarly styled, the fourth exception, for carrier-requested regulations in areas such as &#x93;uniform cargo liability&#x94; and antitrust immunity, &#xA7;14501(c)(3), completely parallels the wording of &#xA7;14501(c)(1): It provides that preemption &#x93;shall not affect any authority of a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of 2 or more States to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision&#x94; in those areas.

				The safety exception of &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A), however, does not borrow language from &#xA7;14501(c)(1).  It simply states that preemption &#x93;shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Notably, the second statutory exception, on which respondents train no attention, is stated with similar economy.  That exception mentions neither States nor political subdivisions; it simply says that the general preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(1), &#x93;does not apply to the transportation of household goods,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B).  Yet it is abundantly clear that, notwithstanding this difference in verbal formulation, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), like its neighbor &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), permits both state and local regulation.

Respondents&#x92; inference from the absence of &#x93;political subdivision of a State&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) would be more persuasive if the omission were the sole difference in the expression of the general rule and the safety exception.  In contrast to &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C) and (c)(3), however, neither the safety exception nor the household-goods exception refers to the &#x93;authority &#x2026; to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision.&#x94;

				Respondents&#x92; restrictive reading of the term &#x93;State,&#x94; we note, introduces an interpretive conundrum of another kind.  Section 14501(c)(1) preempts the power of both States and localities to &#x93;

				 a law, regulation, or other provision.&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  Those conjoined words travel together.  If, as Ours Garage and TRAO argue, the safety exception of &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) reaches only States, then localities are preempted not only from enacting, but equally from 
				<em>
					enforcing, 
				</em>
				safety regulations governing motor carriers of property&#x97;even if those regulations are enacted by the state legislature.  It is unlikely that Congress would preserve States&#x92; power to enact safety rules and, at the same time, bar the ordinary method by which States enforce such rules&#x97;through their local instrumentalities.

				This case, by contrast, deals not with States&#x92; voluntary agreements to relinquish authority vis-&#xE0;-vis their political subdivisions in exchange for federal funds, but with preemption stemming from Congress&#x92; power to regulate commerce, in a field where States have traditionally allowed localities to address local concerns.  Congress&#x92; clear pur-

				pose in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) is to ensure that its preemption of States&#x92; economic authority over motor carriers of property, &#xA7;14501(c)(1), &#x93;not restrict&#x94; the preexisting and traditional state police power over safety.  That power typically includes the choice to delegate the State&#x92;s &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94; to localities.  Forcing a State to refrain from doing so would effectively &#x93;restrict&#x94; that very authority.  Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x93;clear and manifest purpose&#x94; to the contrary, federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.

				The Conference Report on the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 observed that &#x93;[s]tate economic regulation of motor carrier operations &#x2026; is a huge problem for national and regional carriers attempting to conduct a standard way of doing business.&#x94;  H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103&#x96;677, p. 87 (1994).  Carrying more weight, in the Act itself Congress reported its finding that &#x93;the regulation of intrastate transportation of property by the States&#x94; unreasonably burdened free trade, interstate commerce, and American consumers.

				A congressional decision to enact both a general policy that furthers a particular goal and a specific exception that might tend against that goal does not invariably

Such a construction is surely resistible here, for &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s preemption rule and &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A)&#x92;s safety exception to it do not necessarily conflict.  The problem to which the congressional conferees attended was &#x93;[s]tate

Corroboratively, the measure&#x92;s legislative history shows that the deregulatory aim of the legislation had been endorsed by a key interest group&#x97;the American Trucking Association&#x97;subject to &#x93;some conditions that would allow regulatory protection to continue for non-economic factors, such as &#x2026; insurance [and] safety.&#x94;  H.

				The construction of &#xA7;14501 that respondents Ours Garage and TRAO advocate, moreover, does not guarantee uniform regulation.  On respondents&#x92; reading as on petitioners&#x92;, a State could, without affront to the statute, pass discrete, nonuniform safety regulations applicable to each of its several constituent municipalities.  Ohio thus could adopt the Columbus regulations to govern in that city, 
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				the Toledo regulations to govern there, and so on down
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				the line.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37&#x96;38.  Indeed, because &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) refers only to &#x93;political&#x94; subdivisions, nothing in the statute&#x92;s text would impede a State from creating an administrative agency organized into local offices, each of which could craft local rules suitable to its assigned jurisdiction.  There is no reason to suppose that Congress meant to stop the States from spreading their authority among municipalities unless they employ such artificial or inefficient schemes.

The dissent, although it urges that &#x93;we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear,&#x94; post, at 5&#x96;6, rests upon the fact that subdivisions of States do not appear in the safety exception&#x97;as they also do not in the household-goods exception of &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B).

The dissent finds no plain statement in &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s prohibition on local enforcement because it can be read to mean only that &#x93;a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws&#x94; relating to motor carriage of property.  Ibid.  This is by no means the most natural reading of the preemption provision.  The suggestion of the dissent is that, as applied to localities, &#xA7;14501(c)(1) preempts only local enforcement of locally enacted laws.  See ibid.  This interpretation raises the startling possibility that, although &#xA7;14501(c)(1) forbids both States and localities from &#x93;enact[ing]&#x94; new laws, it permits localities (but not States) to enforce previously enacted state laws relating to motor carriage of property.

				Federal preemption prescriptions relating to motor carriers, contained in

				The federal legislation preempts provisions by &#x93;a State [or] political subdivision of a State &#x2026; related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; with respect to the transportation of property.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(1).  As an exception to this general rule, Congress provided that the preemption directive &#x93;shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State with respect to motor vehicles.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  Section 14501(c)(1)&#x92;s statement of the general rule explicitly includes &#x93;State[s]&#x94; and their &#x93;political subdivision[s].&#x94;  The exception for safety regulation, however, specifies only &#x93;State[s]&#x94; and does not mention &#x93;political subdivision[s].&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We hold that &#xA7;14501(c) does not bar a State from delegating to municipalities and other local units the State&#x92;s authority to establish safety regulations governing motor carriers of property, including tow trucks.  A locality, as &#xA7;14501(c) recognizes, is a &#x93;political 
				<em>
					subdivision
				</em>
				&#x94;
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				of the State.  Ordinarily, a political subdivision may exercise whatever portion of state power the State, under its own constitution and laws, chooses to delegate to the subdivision.  Absent a clear statement to the contrary, Congress&#x92; reference to the &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94; should be read to preserve, not preempt, the traditional prerogative of the States to delegate their authority to their constituent parts.

				Plaintiff-respondent Ours Garage and Wrecker Service, Inc., joined by a trade association of tow-truck operators, the Towing and Recovery Association of Ohio (TRAO), brought suit in Federal District Court against the City of Columbus and two city officials to enjoin enforcement of the City&#x92;s tow-truck regulations.

The third exception in the series, covering regulation of prices for nonconsensual tow-truck services, matches the general preemption provision; it explicitly applies to the &#x93;authority of a State or a political subdivision of a State.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C).  States and their political subdivisions are likewise linked in almost every other provision of &#xA7;14501.  See &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(a), 14501(b)(1), 14501(c)(3)(A), 14501(c)(3)(B), 14501(c)(3)(C).

				Respondents Ours Garage and TRAO, in line with several Courts of Appeals, home in on the statute&#x92;s repeated references to both States and their political subdivisions; in contrast, they urge, the singularly bare reference to &#x93;[s]tate&#x94; authority in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A)&#x92;s exception for safety regulation must mean that Congress intended to limit the exception to States alone.

				Respondents Ours Garage and TRAO, as just noted, contrast the first statutory exception to &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s preemption rule, 
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 the exception preserving &#x93;the safety regulatory authority of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A), with the third exception, preserving the &#x93;authority of a State or a political subdivision to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision relating to the price&#x94; charged for nonconsensual towing, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C).  See Brief for Respondents 15&#x96;16.  The nonconsensual towing exception tracks the language and structure of the general preemption rule, omitting only the reference to a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;  Similarly styled, the fourth exception, for carrier-requested regulations in areas such as &#x93;uniform cargo liability&#x94; and antitrust immunity, &#xA7;14501(c)(3), completely parallels the wording of &#xA7;14501(c)(1): It provides that preemption &#x93;shall not affect any authority of a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of 2 or more States to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision&#x94; in those areas.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The safety exception of &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A), however, does not borrow language from &#xA7;14501(c)(1).  It simply states that preemption &#x93;shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Notably, the second statutory exception, on which respondents train no attention, is stated with similar economy.  That exception mentions neither States nor political subdivisions; it simply says that the general preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(1), &#x93;does not apply to the transportation of household goods,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B).  Yet it is abundantly clear that, notwithstanding this difference in verbal formulation, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), like its neighbor &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), permits both state and local regulation.

Respondents&#x92; inference from the absence of &#x93;political subdivision of a State&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) would be more persuasive if the omission were the sole difference in the expression of the general rule and the safety exception.  In contrast to &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C) and (c)(3), however, neither the safety exception nor the household-goods exception refers to the &#x93;authority &#x2026; to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision.&#x94;

				Respondents&#x92; restrictive reading of the term &#x93;State,&#x94; we note, introduces an interpretive conundrum of another kind.  Section 14501(c)(1) preempts the power of both States and localities to &#x93;

				 a law, regulation, or other provision.&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  Those conjoined words travel together.  If, as Ours Garage and TRAO argue, the safety exception of &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) reaches only States, then localities are preempted not only from enacting, but equally from 
				<em>
					enforcing, 
				</em>
				safety regulations governing motor carriers of property&#x97;even if those regulations are enacted by the state legislature.  It is unlikely that Congress would preserve States&#x92; power to enact safety rules and, at the same time, bar the ordinary method by which States enforce such rules&#x97;through their local instrumentalities.

				This case, by contrast, deals not with States&#x92; voluntary agreements to relinquish authority vis-&#xE0;-vis their political subdivisions in exchange for federal funds, but with preemption stemming from Congress&#x92; power to regulate commerce, in a field where States have traditionally allowed localities to address local concerns.  Congress&#x92; clear pur-

				pose in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) is to ensure that its preemption of States&#x92; economic authority over motor carriers of property, &#xA7;14501(c)(1), &#x93;not restrict&#x94; the preexisting and traditional state police power over safety.  That power typically includes the choice to delegate the State&#x92;s &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94; to localities.  Forcing a State to refrain from doing so would effectively &#x93;restrict&#x94; that very authority.  Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x93;clear and manifest purpose&#x94; to the contrary, federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.

				The Conference Report on the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 observed that &#x93;[s]tate economic regulation of motor carrier operations &#x2026; is a huge problem for national and regional carriers attempting to conduct a standard way of doing business.&#x94;  H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103&#x96;677, p. 87 (1994).  Carrying more weight, in the Act itself Congress reported its finding that &#x93;the regulation of intrastate transportation of property by the States&#x94; unreasonably burdened free trade, interstate commerce, and American consumers.

1605.  Congress therefore concluded that &#x93;certain aspects of the State regulatory process should be preempted.&#x94; &#xA7;601(a)(2).  These declarations of deregulatory purpose, however, do not justify interpreting through a deregulatory prism &#x93;aspects of the State regu-

				A congressional decision to enact both a general policy that furthers a particular goal and a specific exception that might tend against that goal does not invariably

				call for the narrowest possible construction of the exception.  Such a construction is surely resistible here, for &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s preemption rule and &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A)&#x92;s safety exception to it do not necessarily conflict.  The problem to which the congressional conferees attended was &#x93;[s]tate

Corroboratively, the measure&#x92;s legislative history shows that the deregulatory aim of the legislation had been endorsed by a key interest group&#x97;the American Trucking Association&#x97;subject to &#x93;some conditions that would allow regulatory protection to continue for non-economic factors, such as &#x2026; insurance [and] safety.&#x94;  H.

				The construction of &#xA7;14501 that respondents Ours Garage and TRAO advocate, moreover, does not guarantee uniform regulation.  On respondents&#x92; reading as on petitioners&#x92;, a State could, without affront to the statute, pass discrete, nonuniform safety regulations applicable to each of its several constituent municipalities.  Ohio thus could adopt the Columbus regulations to govern in that city, 
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				the Toledo regulations to govern there, and so on down
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				the line.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37&#x96;38.  Indeed, because &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) refers only to &#x93;political&#x94; subdivisions, nothing in the statute&#x92;s text would impede a State from creating an administrative agency organized into local offices, each of which could craft local rules suitable to its assigned jurisdiction.  There is no reason to suppose that Congress meant to stop the States from spreading their authority among municipalities unless they employ such artificial or inefficient schemes.

That provision authorizes the Secretary to void any &#x93;State law or regulation on commercial motor vehi-

				We reiterate that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) shields from preemption only &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94; (and &#x93;authority of a State to regulate &#x2026; with regard to minimum amounts of financial responsibility relating to insurance requirements&#x94;).  Local regulation of prices, routes, or services of tow trucks that is not genuinely responsive to safety concerns garners no exemption from &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s preemption rule.

We ultimately draw the same conclusion, of course, regarding the phrasing of the safety exception in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  The dissent, although it urges that &#x93;we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear,&#x94; post, at 5&#x96;6, rests upon the fact that subdivisions of States do not appear in the safety exception&#x97;as they also do not in the household-goods exception of &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B).  That &#xA7;14501(c)(2) comprises three exceptions, each differently stated, seems to us indeed relevant to the interpretive weight that may be attached to the variation among them.

						 Faced with this argument, the dissent is converted, however temporarily, to the view that &#x93;federal interference with the &#x91;historic powers of the States&#x92; must be evinced by a &#x91;plain statement.&#x92; &#x94;  Post, at 8&#x96;9, n. 4 (quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft,

).  The dissent finds no plain statement in &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s prohibition on local enforcement because it can be read to mean only that &#x93;a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws&#x94; relating to motor carriage of property.  Ibid.  This is by no means the most natural reading of the preemption provision.  The suggestion of the dissent is that, as applied to localities, &#xA7;14501(c)(1) preempts only local enforcement of locally enacted laws.  See ibid.  This interpretation raises the startling possibility that, although &#xA7;14501(c)(1) forbids both States and localities from &#x93;enact[ing]&#x94; new laws, it permits localities (but not States) to enforce previously enacted state laws relating to motor carriage of property.

				We hold that &#xA7;14501(c) does not bar a State from delegating to municipalities and other local units the State&#x92;s authority to establish safety regulations governing motor carriers of property, including tow trucks.  A locality, as &#xA7;14501(c) recognizes, is a &#x93;political 
				<em>
					subdivision

				&#x94;
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				of the State.  Ordinarily, a political subdivision may exercise whatever portion of state power the State, under its own constitution and laws, chooses to delegate to the subdivision.  Absent a clear statement to the contrary, Congress&#x92; reference to the &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94; should be read to preserve, not preempt, the traditional prerogative of the States to delegate their authority to their constituent parts.

The third exception in the series, covering regulation of prices for nonconsensual tow-truck services, matches the general preemption provision; it explicitly applies to the &#x93;authority of a State or a political subdivision of a State.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C).  States and their political subdivisions are likewise linked in almost every other provision of &#xA7;14501.  See &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(a), 14501(b)(1), 14501(c)(3)(A), 14501(c)(3)(B), 14501(c)(3)(C).

				Respondents Ours Garage and TRAO, in line with several Courts of Appeals, home in on the statute&#x92;s repeated references to both States and their political subdivisions; in contrast, they urge, the singularly bare reference to &#x93;[s]tate&#x94; authority in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A)&#x92;s exception for safety regulation must mean that Congress intended to limit the exception to States alone.

				We acknowledge that &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s &#x93;disparate inclusion [and] exclusion&#x94; of the words &#x93;political subdivisions&#x94; support an argument of some force, one that could not have been made in

				Respondents Ours Garage and TRAO, as just noted, contrast the first statutory exception to &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s preemption rule, 
				<em>
					i.e.,
				</em>
				 the exception preserving &#x93;the safety regulatory authority of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A), with the third exception, preserving the &#x93;authority of a State or a political subdivision to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision relating to the price&#x94; charged for nonconsensual towing, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C).  See Brief for Respondents 15&#x96;16.  The nonconsensual towing exception tracks the language and structure of the general preemption rule, omitting only the reference to a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;  Similarly styled, the fourth exception, for carrier-requested regulations in areas such as &#x93;uniform cargo liability&#x94; and antitrust immunity, &#xA7;14501(c)(3), completely parallels the wording of &#xA7;14501(c)(1): It provides that preemption &#x93;shall not affect any authority of a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of 2 or more States to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision&#x94; in those areas.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The safety exception of &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A), however, does not borrow language from &#xA7;14501(c)(1).  It simply states that preemption &#x93;shall not restrict the safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Notably, the second statutory exception, on which respondents train no attention, is stated with similar economy.  That exception mentions neither States nor political subdivisions; it simply says that the general preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(1), &#x93;does not apply to the transportation of household goods,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B).  Yet it is abundantly clear that, notwithstanding this difference in verbal formulation, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), like its neighbor &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), permits both state and local regulation.

				The inclusion of the phrase &#x93;the authority of a State

				or a political subdivision of a State to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision&#x94; no doubt synchronizes the nonconsensual towing provision with &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s main rule.  The parallel structure of &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(c)(1)
				<span class="softbreak"/>

Respondents&#x92; inference from the absence of &#x93;political subdivision of a State&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) would be more persuasive if the omission were the sole difference in the expression of the general rule and the safety exception.  In contrast to &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C) and (c)(3), however, neither the safety exception nor the household-goods exception refers to the &#x93;authority &#x2026; to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision.&#x94;

				Respondents&#x92; restrictive reading of the term &#x93;State,&#x94; we note, introduces an interpretive conundrum of another kind.  Section 14501(c)(1) preempts the power of both States and localities to &#x93;
				<em>
					enact or enforce
				</em>
				 a law, regulation, or other provision.&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  Those conjoined words travel together.  If, as Ours Garage and TRAO argue, the safety exception of &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) reaches only States, then localities are preempted not only from enacting, but equally from 
				<em>
					enforcing, 
				</em>
				safety regulations governing motor carriers of property&#x97;even if those regulations are enacted by the state legislature.  It is unlikely that Congress would preserve States&#x92; power to enact safety rules and, at the same time, bar the ordinary method by which States enforce such rules&#x97;through their local instrumentalities.

				This case, by contrast, deals not with States&#x92; voluntary agreements to relinquish authority vis-&#xE0;-vis their political subdivisions in exchange for federal funds, but with preemption stemming from Congress&#x92; power to regulate commerce, in a field where States have traditionally allowed localities to address local concerns.  Congress&#x92; clear pur-
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				pose in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) is to ensure that its preemption of States&#x92; economic authority over motor carriers of property, &#xA7;14501(c)(1), &#x93;not restrict&#x94; the preexisting and traditional state police power over safety.  That power typically includes the choice to delegate the State&#x92;s &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94; to localities.  Forcing a State to refrain from doing so would effectively &#x93;restrict&#x94; that very authority.  Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x93;clear and manifest purpose&#x94; to the contrary, federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.

				The Conference Report on the Federal Aviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994 observed that &#x93;[s]tate economic regulation of motor carrier operations &#x2026; is a huge problem for national and regional carriers attempting to conduct a standard way of doing business.&#x94;  H. R. Conf. Rep. No. 103&#x96;677, p. 87 (1994).  Carrying more weight, in the Act itself Congress reported its finding that &#x93;the regulation of intrastate transportation of property by the States&#x94; unreasonably burdened free trade, interstate commerce, and American consumers.

1605.  Congress therefore concluded that &#x93;certain aspects of the State regulatory process should be preempted.&#x94; &#xA7;601(a)(2).  These declarations of deregulatory purpose, however, do not justify interpreting through a deregulatory prism &#x93;aspects of the State regu-

				A congressional decision to enact both a general policy that furthers a particular goal and a specific exception that might tend against that goal does not invariably

				call for the narrowest possible construction of the exception.  Such a construction is surely resistible here, for &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s preemption rule and &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A)&#x92;s safety exception to it do not necessarily conflict.  The problem to which the congressional conferees attended was &#x93;[s]tate

Corroboratively, the measure&#x92;s legislative history shows that the deregulatory aim of the legislation had been endorsed by a key interest group&#x97;the American Trucking Association&#x97;subject to &#x93;some conditions that would allow regulatory protection to continue for non-economic factors, such as &#x2026; insurance [and] safety.&#x94;  H.

				The construction of &#xA7;14501 that respondents Ours Garage and TRAO advocate, moreover, does not guarantee uniform regulation.  On respondents&#x92; reading as on petitioners&#x92;, a State could, without affront to the statute, pass discrete, nonuniform safety regulations applicable to each of its several constituent municipalities.  Ohio thus could adopt the Columbus regulations to govern in that city, 
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				the Toledo regulations to govern there, and so on down
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				the line.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 37&#x96;38.  Indeed, because &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) refers only to &#x93;political&#x94; subdivisions, nothing in the statute&#x92;s text would impede a State from creating an administrative agency organized into local offices, each of which could craft local rules suitable to its assigned jurisdiction.  There is no reason to suppose that Congress meant to stop the States from spreading their authority among municipalities unless they employ such artificial or inefficient schemes.

Local regulation of prices, routes, or services of tow trucks that is not genuinely responsive to safety concerns garners no exemption from &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s preemption rule.

We ultimately draw the same conclusion, of course, regarding the phrasing of the safety exception in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  The dissent, although it urges that &#x93;we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear,&#x94; post, at 5&#x96;6, rests upon the fact that subdivisions of States do not appear in the safety exception&#x97;as they also do not in the household-goods exception of &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B).  That &#xA7;14501(c)(2) comprises three exceptions, each differently stated, seems to us indeed relevant to the interpretive weight that may be attached to the variation among them.

						 Faced with this argument, the dissent is converted, however temporarily, to the view that &#x93;federal interference with the &#x91;historic powers of the States&#x92; must be evinced by a &#x91;plain statement.&#x92; &#x94;  Post, at 8&#x96;9, n. 4 (quoting Gregory v. Ashcroft,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">461</a> (1991)
).  The dissent finds no plain statement in &#xA7;14501(c)(1)&#x92;s prohibition on local enforcement because it can be read to mean only that &#x93;a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws&#x94; relating to motor carriage of property.  Ibid.  This is by no means the most natural reading of the preemption provision.  The suggestion of the dissent is that, as applied to localities, &#xA7;14501(c)(1) preempts only local enforcement of locally enacted laws.  See ibid.  This interpretation raises the startling possibility that, although &#xA7;14501(c)(1) forbids both States and localities from &#x93;enact[ing]&#x94; new laws, it permits localities (but not States) to enforce previously enacted state laws relating to motor carriage of property.

, the preemption rule would have precisely the same scope if it omitted the reference to &#x93;political subdivision of a State.&#x94;  It is a well-established principle of statutory construction (and of common sense) that when such a situation occurs, when &#x93;two words or expressions are coupled together, one of which generically includes the other, it is obvious that the more general term is used in a meaning excluding the specific one.&#x94;  J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction &#xA7;266, p. 349 (1891).  The only conceivable reason for this specification of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; apart from &#x93;State&#x94; is 
				<em>
					to establish
				</em>
				, in the rule, the two 
				<em>
					separate categories
				</em>
				 of state power&#x97;state power exercised through political subdivisions and state power exercised by the State directly&#x97;that are later treated differently in the exceptions to the rule.

				The situation is comparable to the following hypothetical using the term &#x93;football&#x94; (which may be used to include soccer, see Webster&#x92;s New International Dictionary 983 (2d ed. 1950)): Assume a statute which says that &#x93;football and soccer shall not be played on the town green&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(1)), except that &#x93;football and soccer may be played on Saturdays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C)), &#x93;football and soccer may be played on summer nights&#x94; (14501(c)(3)(A)), and &#x93;football may be played on Mondays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				(2)(A)).  In today&#x92;s opinion, the Court says soccer may be played on Mondays.  I think it clear that soccer is not to be regarded as a subset of football but as a separate category.  And the same is true of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; here.

				The Court reaches the opposite conclusion merely because &#xA7;14501(c) exhibits uneven drafting.  First the Court notes that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) does not &#x93;trac[k] the language and structure of the general preemption rule.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  Whereas other exceptions to the rule refer to the authority of a State or other political entity &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) merely refers to the &#x93;safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Second, the Court notes that another exception to the preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), is &#x93;stated with similar economy.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It addresses merely the 
				<em>
					subject 
				</em>
				of regulation (transportation of household goods) instead of both the subject and the 
				<em>
					source
				</em>
				 of regulation (a State, political subdivision, or political authority of 2 or more States).  This has, the Court notes, the same effect as its neighbor, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), of permitting both state and local regulation.

				  These inconsistencies in the statute&#x92;s drafting style, the Court contends, undermine the conclusion we would ordinarily draw from the absence of the term &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).

				The weakness of this argument should be self-evident.  How can inconsistencies of style, 
				<em>
					on points that have nothing to do with the issue of separating state and local authority
				</em>
				, cause the text&#x92;s crystal-clear distinction between state and local authority to disappear?  It would certainly reflect more orderly draftsmanship if the statute consistently used the formulation &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; rather than replacing it in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) with the equivalent phrase &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94;; and if the statute referred to subject matter alone (&#xE0; la &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B)) either never at all, or else 
				<em>
					whenever
				</em>
				 the exception applied to all three categories of States, subdivisions of States, and political authorities of 2 or more States.  But it is impossible to imagine how this imperfect draftsmanship in unrelated matters casts any doubt upon the precise meaning of the subject-matter-plus-source provisions where they appear. Unless the Court is appealing to some hitherto unknown canon of interpretation&#x97;perhaps (borrowed from the law of evidence) 
				<em>
					negligens in uno, negligens in omnibus
				</em>
				&#x97;the diverse styles of &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s exceptions have nothing to do with whether we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear.

				What is truly anomalous here is not the fact that the terminology of &#xA7;14501(c) is diverse with regard to presently irrelevant matters, but the fact that the Court has today come up with a judicial interpretation of &#xA7;14501(c) that renders the term &#x93;political subdivision of a State,&#x94; which appears throughout,

				Lacking support in the text of the statute, the Court invokes federalism concerns to justify its decision.  &#x93;Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x91;clear and manifest purpose&#x92; to the contrary,&#x94; the Court reasons, &#x93;federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.&#x94;

				With such major impositions as these already on the books, treating &#xA7;14501(c)(1) as some extraordinary federal obstruction of state allocation of power is absurd.  That provision preempts the authority of political subdivisions to regulate &#x93;a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder 
				<em>
					with respect to the transportation of property.
				</em>
				&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  The italicized language massively limits the scope of preemption to include only laws, regulations, and other provisions that single out for special treatment &#x93;motor carriers of property.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c).  States 
				<em>

				and trucks that may enter highways or pass over bridges, and other regulations that do not target motor carriers &#x93;with respect to the transportation of property.&#x94;  In addition, the exception contained in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) allows a State&#x97;but not a political subdivision&#x97;to apply special safety rules (rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94;) to motor carriers of property.

						 Not only is this point (as the text proceeds to discuss) irrelevant in principle; it is misleading in its description of fact, suggesting that the two neighboring sections produce the same result with different language.  It is true enough that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), like &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), permits both state and local regulation.  But 14501(c)(2)(C), unlike &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), also permits regulation by a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;

						 The Court thinks these examples are &#x93;hardly comparable&#x94; to &#xA7;14501(c) because many involve Spending Clause legislation.  Ante, at 11&#x96;12.  A sufficient answer is that one of them does not, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7410.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;7410</a> (1994 ed.) (Clean Air Act), and that other examples not involving Spending Clause legislation could be added, see, e.g.,

But in any event, a siphoning off of the States&#x92; &#x93;historic powers&#x94; to delegate has equally been achieved, whether it has come about through the coercion of deprivation of Spending Clause funds or through other means.  The point is that it is not unusual for Congress to interfere in this matter.

						 This interpretation of the statutory scheme &#x93;introduces an inter-pretive conundrum of another kind,&#x94; the Court asserts, because &#xA7;14501(c)(1) declares that a political subdivision may not &#x93;enact or enforce&#x94; laws, regulations, or other provisions relating to motor carriers of property.  Ante, at 9.  In the Court&#x92;s view, if the term &#x93;State&#x94; does not include &#x93;subdivision of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(1) will prevent a State from relying on localities to &#x93;enforce&#x94; rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority.&#x94;  Ibid.  But the conclusion that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents a political subdivision from enforcing regulations enacted by the State can only be reached by ignoring (for this issue) the rule that the Court is so insistent upon elsewhere: that federal interference with the &#x93;historic powers of the States&#x94; must be evinced by a &#x93;plain statement,&#x94; Gregory v. Ashcroft, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/501/452" class="subref" title="subref">501 U. S. 452</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">461</a> (1991)
.  A natural reading of the phrase &#x93;a &#x2026; political subdivision of a State . . . may not enact or enforce a law&#x94;&#x97;and a reading faithful to Gregory&#x92;s plain statement rule&#x97;is that a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws.  The Court believes this reading &#x93;raises the startling possibility,&#x94; ante, at 10, n. 3, that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents States but not political subdivisions from enforcing previously enacted State regulations relating to motor carriage of property.  I think not.  A possibility so startling (and unlikely to occur) is well enough precluded by the rule that a statute should not be interpreted to produce absurd results.  The municipalities&#x92; reserved power to enforce state law does not include the power to enforce state law that the State has no continuing power to enact or enforce.

				The situation is comparable to the following hypothetical using the term &#x93;football&#x94; (which may be used to include soccer, see Webster&#x92;s New International Dictionary 983 (2d ed. 1950)): Assume a statute which says that &#x93;football and soccer shall not be played on the town green&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(1)), except that &#x93;football and soccer may be played on Saturdays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C)), &#x93;football and soccer may be played on summer nights&#x94; (14501(c)(3)(A)), and &#x93;football may be played on Mondays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)

				(2)(A)).  In today&#x92;s opinion, the Court says soccer may be played on Mondays.  I think it clear that soccer is not to be regarded as a subset of football but as a separate category.  And the same is true of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; here.

				The Court reaches the opposite conclusion merely because &#xA7;14501(c) exhibits uneven drafting.  First the Court notes that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) does not &#x93;trac[k] the language and structure of the general preemption rule.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  Whereas other exceptions to the rule refer to the authority of a State or other political entity &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) merely refers to the &#x93;safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Second, the Court notes that another exception to the preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), is &#x93;stated with similar economy.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It addresses merely the 
				<em>
					subject 
				</em>
				of regulation (transportation of household goods) instead of both the subject and the 
				<em>
					source
				</em>
				 of regulation (a State, political subdivision, or political authority of 2 or more States).  This has, the Court notes, the same effect as its neighbor, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), of permitting both state and local regulation.

				  These inconsistencies in the statute&#x92;s drafting style, the Court contends, undermine the conclusion we would ordinarily draw from the absence of the term &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).

				The weakness of this argument should be self-evident.  How can inconsistencies of style, 
				<em>
					on points that have nothing to do with the issue of separating state and local authority
				</em>
				, cause the text&#x92;s crystal-clear distinction between state and local authority to disappear?  It would certainly reflect more orderly draftsmanship if the statute consistently used the formulation &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; rather than replacing it in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) with the equivalent phrase &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94;; and if the statute referred to subject matter alone (&#xE0; la &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B)) either never at all, or else 
				<em>
					whenever
				</em>
				 the exception applied to all three categories of States, subdivisions of States, and political authorities of 2 or more States.  But it is impossible to imagine how this imperfect draftsmanship in unrelated matters casts any doubt upon the precise meaning of the subject-matter-plus-source provisions where they appear. Unless the Court is appealing to some hitherto unknown canon of interpretation&#x97;perhaps (borrowed from the law of evidence) 
				<em>
					negligens in uno, negligens in omnibus
				</em>
				&#x97;the diverse styles of &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s exceptions have nothing to do with whether we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear.

				What is truly anomalous here is not the fact that the terminology of &#xA7;14501(c) is diverse with regard to presently irrelevant matters, but the fact that the Court has today come up with a judicial interpretation of &#xA7;14501(c) that renders the term &#x93;political subdivision of a State,&#x94; which appears throughout,

				Lacking support in the text of the statute, the Court invokes federalism concerns to justify its decision.  &#x93;Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x91;clear and manifest purpose&#x92; to the contrary,&#x94; the Court reasons, &#x93;federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.&#x94;

				With such major impositions as these already on the books, treating &#xA7;14501(c)(1) as some extraordinary federal obstruction of state allocation of power is absurd.  That provision preempts the authority of political subdivisions to regulate &#x93;a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder 
				<em>
					with respect to the transportation of property.
				</em>
				&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  The italicized language massively limits the scope of preemption to include only laws, regulations, and other provisions that single out for special treatment &#x93;motor carriers of property.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c).  States

						 Not only is this point (as the text proceeds to discuss) irrelevant in principle; it is misleading in its description of fact, suggesting that the two neighboring sections produce the same result with different language.  It is true enough that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), like &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), permits both state and local regulation.  But 14501(c)(2)(C), unlike &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), also permits regulation by a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;

						 The Court thinks these examples are &#x93;hardly comparable&#x94; to &#xA7;14501(c) because many involve Spending Clause legislation.  Ante, at 11&#x96;12.  A sufficient answer is that one of them does not, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7410.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;7410</a> (1994 ed.) (Clean Air Act), and that other examples not involving Spending Clause legislation could be added, see, e.g.,

But in any event, a siphoning off of the States&#x92; &#x93;historic powers&#x94; to delegate has equally been achieved, whether it has come about through the coercion of deprivation of Spending Clause funds or through other means.  The point is that it is not unusual for Congress to interfere in this matter.

						 This interpretation of the statutory scheme &#x93;introduces an inter-pretive conundrum of another kind,&#x94; the Court asserts, because &#xA7;14501(c)(1) declares that a political subdivision may not &#x93;enact or enforce&#x94; laws, regulations, or other provisions relating to motor carriers of property.  Ante, at 9.  In the Court&#x92;s view, if the term &#x93;State&#x94; does not include &#x93;subdivision of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(1) will prevent a State from relying on localities to &#x93;enforce&#x94; rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority.&#x94;  Ibid.  But the conclusion that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents a political subdivision from enforcing regulations enacted by the State can only be reached by ignoring (for this issue) the rule that the Court is so insistent upon elsewhere: that federal interference with the &#x93;historic powers of the States&#x94; must be evinced by a &#x93;plain statement,&#x94; Gregory v.

A natural reading of the phrase &#x93;a &#x2026; political subdivision of a State . . . may not enact or enforce a law&#x94;&#x97;and a reading faithful to Gregory&#x92;s plain statement rule&#x97;is that a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws.  The Court believes this reading &#x93;raises the startling possibility,&#x94; ante, at 10, n. 3, that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents States but not political subdivisions from enforcing previously enacted State regulations relating to motor carriage of property.  I think not.  A possibility so startling (and unlikely to occur) is well enough precluded by the rule that a statute should not be interpreted to produce absurd results.  The municipalities&#x92; reserved power to enforce state law does not include the power to enforce state law that the State has no continuing power to enact or enforce.

				The dispute in the present case arises from the fact that a reference to &#x93;State&#x94; power or authority can be meant to include 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 that power or authority, including the portion exercised by political subdivisions (as, for example, in the ordinary reference to &#x93;the State&#x92;s police power&#x94;); but can also be meant to include only that power or authority exercised at the state level (as, for example, in the phrase &#x93;State and local governmental authority&#x94;).

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">23</a> (1983)
.  The only way to impart some purpose and intent here is to assume that the word &#x93;State&#x94; is used in its narrower sense, so that political subdivisions are not covered by the term.  The Court admits that the rule applied in 
				<em>
					Russello
				</em>
				 &#x93;supports an argument of some force,&#x94; 
				<em>

				 with which &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) excludes political subdivisions.  For the clarity begins not just with the various exceptions, but with the very preemption rule to which the exceptions are appended.  That rule reads:

, the preemption rule would have precisely the same scope if it omitted the reference to &#x93;political subdivision of a State.&#x94;  It is a well-established principle of statutory construction (and of common sense) that when such a situation occurs, when &#x93;two words or expressions are coupled together, one of which generically includes the other, it is obvious that the more general term is used in a meaning excluding the specific one.&#x94;  J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction &#xA7;266, p. 349 (1891).  The only conceivable reason for this specification of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; apart from &#x93;State&#x94; is 
				<em>
					to establish
				</em>
				, in the rule, the two 
				<em>
					separate categories
				</em>
				 of state power&#x97;state power exercised through political subdivisions and state power exercised by the State directly&#x97;that are later treated differently in the exceptions to the rule.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The situation is comparable to the following hypothetical using the term &#x93;football&#x94; (which may be used to include soccer, see Webster&#x92;s New International Dictionary 983 (2d ed. 1950)): Assume a statute which says that &#x93;football and soccer shall not be played on the town green&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(1)), except that &#x93;football and soccer may be played on Saturdays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C)), &#x93;football and soccer may be played on summer nights&#x94; (14501(c)(3)(A)), and &#x93;football may be played on Mondays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				(2)(A)).  In today&#x92;s opinion, the Court says soccer may be played on Mondays.  I think it clear that soccer is not to be regarded as a subset of football but as a separate category.  And the same is true of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; here.

				The Court reaches the opposite conclusion merely because &#xA7;14501(c) exhibits uneven drafting.  First the Court notes that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) does not &#x93;trac[k] the language and structure of the general preemption rule.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  Whereas other exceptions to the rule refer to the authority of a State or other political entity &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) merely refers to the &#x93;safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Second, the Court notes that another exception to the preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), is &#x93;stated with similar economy.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It addresses merely the 
				<em>
					subject 
				</em>
				of regulation (transportation of household goods) instead of both the subject and the 
				<em>
					source
				</em>
				 of regulation (a State, political subdivision, or political authority of 2 or more States).  This has, the Court notes, the same effect as its neighbor, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), of permitting both state and local regulation.

				  These inconsistencies in the statute&#x92;s drafting style, the Court contends, undermine the conclusion we would ordinarily draw from the absence of the term &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The weakness of this argument should be self-evident.  How can inconsistencies of style, 
				<em>
					on points that have nothing to do with the issue of separating state and local authority
				</em>
				, cause the text&#x92;s crystal-clear distinction between state and local authority to disappear?  It would certainly reflect more orderly draftsmanship if the statute consistently used the formulation &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; rather than replacing it in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) with the equivalent phrase &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94;; and if the statute referred to subject matter alone (&#xE0; la &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B)) either never at all, or else 
				<em>
					whenever
				</em>
				 the exception applied to all three categories of States, subdivisions of States, and political authorities of 2 or more States.  But it is impossible to imagine how this imperfect draftsmanship in unrelated matters casts any doubt upon the precise meaning of the subject-matter-plus-source provisions where they appear. Unless the Court is appealing to some hitherto unknown canon of interpretation&#x97;perhaps (borrowed from the law of evidence) 
				<em>
					negligens in uno, negligens in omnibus
				</em>
				&#x97;the diverse styles of &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s exceptions have nothing to do with whether we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				What is truly anomalous here is not the fact that the terminology of &#xA7;14501(c) is diverse with regard to presently irrelevant matters, but the fact that the Court has today come up with a judicial interpretation of &#xA7;14501(c) that renders the term &#x93;political subdivision of a State,&#x94; which appears throughout, 
				<em>
					utterly superfluous

				Lacking support in the text of the statute, the Court invokes federalism concerns to justify its decision.  &#x93;Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x91;clear and manifest purpose&#x92; to the contrary,&#x94; the Court reasons, &#x93;federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.&#x94;

				With such major impositions as these already on the books, treating &#xA7;14501(c)(1) as some extraordinary federal obstruction of state allocation of power is absurd.  That provision preempts the authority of political subdivisions to regulate &#x93;a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder 
				<em>
					with respect to the transportation of property.

				&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  The italicized language massively limits the scope of preemption to include only laws, regulations, and other provisions that single out for special treatment &#x93;motor carriers of property.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c).  States

				and trucks that may enter highways or pass over bridges, and other regulations that do not target motor carriers &#x93;with respect to the transportation of property.&#x94;  In addition, the exception contained in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) allows a State&#x97;but not a political subdivision&#x97;to apply special safety rules (rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94;) to motor carriers of property.

						 Not only is this point (as the text proceeds to discuss) irrelevant in principle; it is misleading in its description of fact, suggesting that the two neighboring sections produce the same result with different language.  It is true enough that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), like &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), permits both state and local regulation.  But 14501(c)(2)(C), unlike &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), also permits regulation by a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;

						 The Court thinks these examples are &#x93;hardly comparable&#x94; to &#xA7;14501(c) because many involve Spending Clause legislation.  Ante, at 11&#x96;12.  A sufficient answer is that one of them does not, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7410.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;7410</a> (1994 ed.) (Clean Air Act), and that other examples not involving Spending Clause legislation could be added, see, e.g., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1313.html#d" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;1313(d)</a> (Clean Water Act).  But in any event, a siphoning off of the States&#x92; &#x93;historic powers&#x94; to delegate has equally been achieved, whether it has come about through the coercion of deprivation of Spending Clause funds or through other means.  The point is that it is not unusual for Congress to interfere in this matter.

						 The Court thinks the Clean Air Act is a bad example merely because a State can rely on political subdivisions to enforce the State&#x92;s im-plementation plan.  Ante, at 12&#x96;13, n. 4; see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7407.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;7407(a)</a>.  So what?  Only States may adopt implementation plans; this duty cannot be delegated to localities.  Moreover, as I explain n. 4, infra, the statute at issue here is no different.  Under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/49/14501.html#c_1" class="subref" title="subref">49 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(c)(1)</a> and (c)(2)(A), a State may enact regulations pursuant to its &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94; and rely on localities to enforce those regulations.

						 This interpretation of the statutory scheme &#x93;introduces an inter-pretive conundrum of another kind,&#x94; the Court asserts, because &#xA7;14501(c)(1) declares that a political subdivision may not &#x93;enact or enforce&#x94; laws, regulations, or other provisions relating to motor carriers of property.  Ante, at 9.  In the Court&#x92;s view, if the term &#x93;State&#x94; does not include &#x93;subdivision of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(1) will prevent a State from relying on localities to &#x93;enforce&#x94; rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority.&#x94;  Ibid.  But the conclusion that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents a political subdivision from enforcing regulations enacted by the State can only be reached by ignoring (for this issue) the rule that the Court is so insistent upon elsewhere: that federal interference with the &#x93;historic powers of the States&#x94; must be evinced by a &#x93;plain statement,&#x94; Gregory v. Ashcroft, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/501/452" class="subref" title="subref">501 U. S. 452</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">461</a> (1991)
.  A natural reading of the phrase &#x93;a &#x2026; political subdivision of a State . . . may not enact or enforce a law&#x94;&#x97;and a reading faithful to Gregory&#x92;s plain statement rule&#x97;is that a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws.  The Court believes this reading &#x93;raises the startling possibility,&#x94; ante, at 10, n. 3, that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents States but not political subdivisions from enforcing previously enacted State regulations relating to motor carriage of property.  I think not.  A possibility so startling (and unlikely to occur) is well enough precluded by the rule that a statute should not be interpreted to produce absurd results.  The municipalities&#x92; reserved power to enforce state law does not include the power to enforce state law that the State has no continuing power to enact or enforce.

				The dispute in the present case arises from the fact that a reference to &#x93;State&#x94; power or authority can be meant to include

				 that power or authority, including the portion exercised by political subdivisions (as, for example, in the ordinary reference to &#x93;the State&#x92;s police power&#x94;); but can also be meant to include only that power or authority exercised at the state level (as, for example, in the phrase &#x93;State and local governmental authority&#x94;).

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">23</a> (1983)
.  The only way to impart some purpose and intent here is to assume that the word &#x93;State&#x94; is used in its narrower sense, so that political subdivisions are not covered by the term.  The Court admits that the rule applied in 
				<em>
					Russello
				</em>
				 &#x93;supports an argument of some force,&#x94; 
				<em>

				<em>

				</em>
				 with which &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) excludes political subdivisions.  For the clarity begins not just with the various exceptions, but with the very preemption rule to which the exceptions are appended.  That rule reads:

        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;Except as provided [in &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(c)(2), (3)], a State, political subdivision of a State, or political authority of 2 or more States may not enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision having the force and effect of law related to a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder with respect to the transportation of property.&#x94;

, the preemption rule would have precisely the same scope if it omitted the reference to &#x93;political subdivision of a State.&#x94;  It is a well-established principle of statutory construction (and of common sense) that when such a situation occurs, when &#x93;two words or expressions are coupled together, one of which generically includes the other, it is obvious that the more general term is used in a meaning excluding the specific one.&#x94;  J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction &#xA7;266, p. 349 (1891).  The only conceivable reason for this specification of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; apart from &#x93;State&#x94; is 
				<em>
					to establish
				</em>
				, in the rule, the two 
				<em>
					separate categories

				The situation is comparable to the following hypothetical using the term &#x93;football&#x94; (which may be used to include soccer, see Webster&#x92;s New International Dictionary 983 (2d ed. 1950)): Assume a statute which says that &#x93;football and soccer shall not be played on the town green&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(1)), except that &#x93;football and soccer may be played on Saturdays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C)), &#x93;football and soccer may be played on summer nights&#x94; (14501(c)(3)(A)), and &#x93;football may be played on Mondays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				(2)(A)).  In today&#x92;s opinion, the Court says soccer may be played on Mondays.  I think it clear that soccer is not to be regarded as a subset of football but as a separate category.  And the same is true of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; here.

				The Court reaches the opposite conclusion merely because &#xA7;14501(c) exhibits uneven drafting.  First the Court notes that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) does not &#x93;trac[k] the language and structure of the general preemption rule.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  Whereas other exceptions to the rule refer to the authority of a State or other political entity &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) merely refers to the &#x93;safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Second, the Court notes that another exception to the preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), is &#x93;stated with similar economy.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It addresses merely the 
				<em>
					subject 
				</em>
				of regulation (transportation of household goods) instead of both the subject and the 
				<em>
					source
				</em>
				 of regulation (a State, political subdivision, or political authority of 2 or more States).  This has, the Court notes, the same effect as its neighbor, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), of permitting both state and local regulation.

				  These inconsistencies in the statute&#x92;s drafting style, the Court contends, undermine the conclusion we would ordinarily draw from the absence of the term &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The weakness of this argument should be self-evident.  How can inconsistencies of style, 
				<em>
					on points that have nothing to do with the issue of separating state and local authority
				</em>
				, cause the text&#x92;s crystal-clear distinction between state and local authority to disappear?  It would certainly reflect more orderly draftsmanship if the statute consistently used the formulation &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; rather than replacing it in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) with the equivalent phrase &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94;; and if the statute referred to subject matter alone (&#xE0; la &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B)) either never at all, or else 
				<em>
					whenever
				</em>
				 the exception applied to all three categories of States, subdivisions of States, and political authorities of 2 or more States.  But it is impossible to imagine how this imperfect draftsmanship in unrelated matters casts any doubt upon the precise meaning of the subject-matter-plus-source provisions where they appear. Unless the Court is appealing to some hitherto unknown canon of interpretation&#x97;perhaps (borrowed from the law of evidence) 
				<em>
					negligens in uno, negligens in omnibus
				</em>
				&#x97;the diverse styles of &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s exceptions have nothing to do with whether we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				What is truly anomalous here is not the fact that the terminology of &#xA7;14501(c) is diverse with regard to presently irrelevant matters, but the fact that the Court has today come up with a judicial interpretation of &#xA7;14501(c) that renders the term &#x93;political subdivision of a State,&#x94; which appears throughout,

				Lacking support in the text of the statute, the Court invokes federalism concerns to justify its decision.  &#x93;Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x91;clear and manifest purpose&#x92; to the contrary,&#x94; the Court reasons, &#x93;federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.&#x94;

				With such major impositions as these already on the books, treating &#xA7;14501(c)(1) as some extraordinary federal obstruction of state allocation of power is absurd.  That provision preempts the authority of political subdivisions to regulate &#x93;a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder 
				<em>
					with respect to the transportation of property.
				</em>
				&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  The italicized language massively limits the scope of preemption to include only laws, regulations, and other provisions that single out for special treatment &#x93;motor carriers of property.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c).  States 
				<em>
					and political sub-divisions 
				</em>
				remain free to enact and enforce general traf-

				fic safety laws, general restrictions on the weight of cars
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				and trucks that may enter highways or pass over bridges, and other regulations that do not target motor carriers &#x93;with respect to the transportation of property.&#x94;  In addition, the exception contained in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) allows a State&#x97;but not a political subdivision&#x97;to apply special safety rules (rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94;) to motor carriers of property.

						 Not only is this point (as the text proceeds to discuss) irrelevant in principle; it is misleading in its description of fact, suggesting that the two neighboring sections produce the same result with different language.  It is true enough that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), like &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), permits both state and local regulation.  But 14501(c)(2)(C), unlike &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), also permits regulation by a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;

						 The Court thinks these examples are &#x93;hardly comparable&#x94; to &#xA7;14501(c) because many involve Spending Clause legislation.  Ante, at 11&#x96;12.  A sufficient answer is that one of them does not, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7410.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;7410</a> (1994 ed.) (Clean Air Act), and that other examples not involving Spending Clause legislation could be added, see, e.g., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1313.html#d" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;1313(d)</a> (Clean Water Act).  But in any event, a siphoning off of the States&#x92; &#x93;historic powers&#x94; to delegate has equally been achieved, whether it has come about through the coercion of deprivation of Spending Clause funds or through other means.  The point is that it is not unusual for Congress to interfere in this matter.

						 The Court thinks the Clean Air Act is a bad example merely because a State can rely on political subdivisions to enforce the State&#x92;s im-plementation plan.  Ante, at 12&#x96;13, n. 4; see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7407.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;7407(a)</a>.  So what?  Only States may adopt implementation plans; this duty cannot be delegated to localities.  Moreover, as I explain n. 4, infra, the statute at issue here is no different.  Under

						 This interpretation of the statutory scheme &#x93;introduces an inter-pretive conundrum of another kind,&#x94; the Court asserts, because &#xA7;14501(c)(1) declares that a political subdivision may not &#x93;enact or enforce&#x94; laws, regulations, or other provisions relating to motor carriers of property.  Ante, at 9.  In the Court&#x92;s view, if the term &#x93;State&#x94; does not include &#x93;subdivision of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(1) will prevent a State from relying on localities to &#x93;enforce&#x94; rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority.&#x94;  Ibid.  But the conclusion that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents a political subdivision from enforcing regulations enacted by the State can only be reached by ignoring (for this issue) the rule that the Court is so insistent upon elsewhere: that federal interference with the &#x93;historic powers of the States&#x94; must be evinced by a &#x93;plain statement,&#x94; Gregory v. Ashcroft, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/501/452" class="subref" title="subref">501 U. S. 452</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">461</a> (1991)
.  A natural reading of the phrase &#x93;a &#x2026; political subdivision of a State . . . may not enact or enforce a law&#x94;&#x97;and a reading faithful to Gregory&#x92;s plain statement rule&#x97;is that a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws.  The Court believes this reading &#x93;raises the startling possibility,&#x94; ante, at 10, n. 3, that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents States but not political subdivisions from enforcing previously enacted State regulations relating to motor carriage of property.  I think not.  A possibility so startling (and unlikely to occur) is well enough precluded by the rule that a statute should not be interpreted to produce absurd results.  The municipalities&#x92; reserved power to enforce state law does not include the power to enforce state law that the State has no continuing power to enact or enforce.

				The dispute in the present case arises from the fact that a reference to &#x93;State&#x94; power or authority can be meant to include 
				<em>
					all
				</em>
				 that power or authority, including the portion exercised by political subdivisions (as, for example, in the ordinary reference to &#x93;the State&#x92;s police power&#x94;); but can also be meant to include only that power or authority exercised at the state level (as, for example, in the phrase &#x93;State and local governmental authority&#x94;).

.  The only way to impart some purpose and intent here is to assume that the word &#x93;State&#x94; is used in its narrower sense, so that political subdivisions are not covered by the term.  The Court admits that the rule applied in

				 &#x93;supports an argument of some force,&#x94;

Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction &#xA7;266, p. 349 (1891).  The only conceivable reason for this specification of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; apart from &#x93;State&#x94; is 
				<em>
					to establish
				</em>
				, in the rule, the two 
				<em>

				The situation is comparable to the following hypothetical using the term &#x93;football&#x94; (which may be used to include soccer, see Webster&#x92;s New International Dictionary 983 (2d ed. 1950)): Assume a statute which says that &#x93;football and soccer shall not be played on the town green&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(1)), except that &#x93;football and soccer may be played on Saturdays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C)), &#x93;football and soccer may be played on summer nights&#x94; (14501(c)(3)(A)), and &#x93;football may be played on Mondays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				(2)(A)).  In today&#x92;s opinion, the Court says soccer may be played on Mondays.  I think it clear that soccer is not to be regarded as a subset of football but as a separate category.  And the same is true of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; here.

				The Court reaches the opposite conclusion merely because &#xA7;14501(c) exhibits uneven drafting.  First the Court notes that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) does not &#x93;trac[k] the language and structure of the general preemption rule.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  Whereas other exceptions to the rule refer to the authority of a State or other political entity &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) merely refers to the &#x93;safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Second, the Court notes that another exception to the preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), is &#x93;stated with similar economy.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It addresses merely the 
				<em>
					subject 
				</em>
				of regulation (transportation of household goods) instead of both the subject and the 
				<em>
					source
				</em>
				 of regulation (a State, political subdivision, or political authority of 2 or more States).  This has, the Court notes, the same effect as its neighbor, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), of permitting both state and local regulation.

				  These inconsistencies in the statute&#x92;s drafting style, the Court contends, undermine the conclusion we would ordinarily draw from the absence of the term &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  
				<em>

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The weakness of this argument should be self-evident.  How can inconsistencies of style, 
				<em>
					on points that have nothing to do with the issue of separating state and local authority
				</em>
				, cause the text&#x92;s crystal-clear distinction between state and local authority to disappear?  It would certainly reflect more orderly draftsmanship if the statute consistently used the formulation &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; rather than replacing it in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) with the equivalent phrase &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94;; and if the statute referred to subject matter alone (&#xE0; la &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B)) either never at all, or else 
				<em>
					whenever
				</em>
				 the exception applied to all three categories of States, subdivisions of States, and political authorities of 2 or more States.  But it is impossible to imagine how this imperfect draftsmanship in unrelated matters casts any doubt upon the precise meaning of the subject-matter-plus-source provisions where they appear. Unless the Court is appealing to some hitherto unknown canon of interpretation&#x97;perhaps (borrowed from the law of evidence) 
				<em>
					negligens in uno, negligens in omnibus
				</em>
				&#x97;the diverse styles of &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s exceptions have nothing to do with whether we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear.

				What is truly anomalous here is not the fact that the terminology of &#xA7;14501(c) is diverse with regard to presently irrelevant matters, but the fact that the Court has today come up with a judicial interpretation of &#xA7;14501(c) that renders the term &#x93;political subdivision of a State,&#x94; which appears throughout,

				Lacking support in the text of the statute, the Court invokes federalism concerns to justify its decision.  &#x93;Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x91;clear and manifest purpose&#x92; to the contrary,&#x94; the Court reasons, &#x93;federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.&#x94;

				With such major impositions as these already on the books, treating &#xA7;14501(c)(1) as some extraordinary federal obstruction of state allocation of power is absurd.  That provision preempts the authority of political subdivisions to regulate &#x93;a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder 
				<em>
					with respect to the transportation of property.
				</em>
				&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  The italicized language massively limits the scope of preemption to include only laws, regulations, and other provisions that single out for special treatment &#x93;motor carriers of property.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c).  States

				and trucks that may enter highways or pass over bridges, and other regulations that do not target motor carriers &#x93;with respect to the transportation of property.&#x94;  In addition, the exception contained in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) allows a State&#x97;but not a political subdivision&#x97;to apply special safety rules (rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94;) to motor carriers of property.

						 Not only is this point (as the text proceeds to discuss) irrelevant in principle; it is misleading in its description of fact, suggesting that the two neighboring sections produce the same result with different language.  It is true enough that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), like &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), permits both state and local regulation.  But 14501(c)(2)(C), unlike &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), also permits regulation by a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;

						 The Court thinks these examples are &#x93;hardly comparable&#x94; to &#xA7;14501(c) because many involve Spending Clause legislation.  Ante, at 11&#x96;12.  A sufficient answer is that one of them does not, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7410.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;7410</a> (1994 ed.) (Clean Air Act), and that other examples not involving Spending Clause legislation could be added, see, e.g.,

But in any event, a siphoning off of the States&#x92; &#x93;historic powers&#x94; to delegate has equally been achieved, whether it has come about through the coercion of deprivation of Spending Clause funds or through other means.  The point is that it is not unusual for Congress to interfere in this matter.

						 The Court thinks the Clean Air Act is a bad example merely because a State can rely on political subdivisions to enforce the State&#x92;s im-plementation plan.  Ante, at 12&#x96;13, n. 4; see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7407.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;7407(a)</a>.  So what?  Only States may adopt implementation plans; this duty cannot be delegated to localities.  Moreover, as I explain n. 4, infra, the statute at issue here is no different.  Under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/49/14501.html#c_1" class="subref" title="subref">49 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(c)(1)</a> and (c)(2)(A), a State may enact regulations pursuant to its &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94; and rely on localities to enforce those regulations.

						 This interpretation of the statutory scheme &#x93;introduces an inter-pretive conundrum of another kind,&#x94; the Court asserts, because &#xA7;14501(c)(1) declares that a political subdivision may not &#x93;enact or enforce&#x94; laws, regulations, or other provisions relating to motor carriers of property.  Ante, at 9.  In the Court&#x92;s view, if the term &#x93;State&#x94; does not include &#x93;subdivision of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(1) will prevent a State from relying on localities to &#x93;enforce&#x94; rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority.&#x94;  Ibid.  But the conclusion that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents a political subdivision from enforcing regulations enacted by the State can only be reached by ignoring (for this issue) the rule that the Court is so insistent upon elsewhere: that federal interference with the &#x93;historic powers of the States&#x94; must be evinced by a &#x93;plain statement,&#x94; Gregory v. Ashcroft, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/501/452" class="subref" title="subref">501 U. S. 452</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">461</a> (1991)
.  A natural reading of the phrase &#x93;a &#x2026; political subdivision of a State . . . may not enact or enforce a law&#x94;&#x97;and a reading faithful to Gregory&#x92;s plain statement rule&#x97;is that a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws.  The Court believes this reading &#x93;raises the startling possibility,&#x94; ante, at 10, n. 3, that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents States but not political subdivisions from enforcing previously enacted State regulations relating to motor carriage of property.  I think not.  A possibility so startling (and unlikely to occur) is well enough precluded by the rule that a statute should not be interpreted to produce absurd results.  The municipalities&#x92; reserved power to enforce state law does not include the power to enforce state law that the State has no continuing power to enact or enforce.

Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction &#xA7;266, p. 349 (1891).  The only conceivable reason for this specification of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; apart from &#x93;State&#x94; is 
				<em>

				, in the rule, the two

				The situation is comparable to the following hypothetical using the term &#x93;football&#x94; (which may be used to include soccer, see Webster&#x92;s New International Dictionary 983 (2d ed. 1950)): Assume a statute which says that &#x93;football and soccer shall not be played on the town green&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(1)), except that &#x93;football and soccer may be played on Saturdays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C)), &#x93;football and soccer may be played on summer nights&#x94; (14501(c)(3)(A)), and &#x93;football may be played on Mondays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				(2)(A)).  In today&#x92;s opinion, the Court says soccer may be played on Mondays.  I think it clear that soccer is not to be regarded as a subset of football but as a separate category.  And the same is true of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; here.

Whereas other exceptions to the rule refer to the authority of a State or other political entity &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) merely refers to the &#x93;safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Second, the Court notes that another exception to the preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), is &#x93;stated with similar economy.&#x94;

				 of regulation (a State, political subdivision, or political authority of 2 or more States).  This has, the Court notes, the same effect as its neighbor, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), of permitting both state and local regulation.

				  These inconsistencies in the statute&#x92;s drafting style, the Court contends, undermine the conclusion we would ordinarily draw from the absence of the term &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).

				The weakness of this argument should be self-evident.  How can inconsistencies of style, 
				<em>
					on points that have nothing to do with the issue of separating state and local authority
				</em>
				, cause the text&#x92;s crystal-clear distinction between state and local authority to disappear?  It would certainly reflect more orderly draftsmanship if the statute consistently used the formulation &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; rather than replacing it in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) with the equivalent phrase &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94;; and if the statute referred to subject matter alone (&#xE0; la &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B)) either never at all, or else 
				<em>
					whenever
				</em>
				 the exception applied to all three categories of States, subdivisions of States, and political authorities of 2 or more States.  But it is impossible to imagine how this imperfect draftsmanship in unrelated matters casts any doubt upon the precise meaning of the subject-matter-plus-source provisions where they appear. Unless the Court is appealing to some hitherto unknown canon of interpretation&#x97;perhaps (borrowed from the law of evidence) 
				<em>
					negligens in uno, negligens in omnibus
				</em>
				&#x97;the diverse styles of &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s exceptions have nothing to do with whether we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear.

				What is truly anomalous here is not the fact that the terminology of &#xA7;14501(c) is diverse with regard to presently irrelevant matters, but the fact that the Court has today come up with a judicial interpretation of &#xA7;14501(c) that renders the term &#x93;political subdivision of a State,&#x94; which appears throughout,

				Lacking support in the text of the statute, the Court invokes federalism concerns to justify its decision.  &#x93;Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x91;clear and manifest purpose&#x92; to the contrary,&#x94; the Court reasons, &#x93;federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.&#x94;

				With such major impositions as these already on the books, treating &#xA7;14501(c)(1) as some extraordinary federal obstruction of state allocation of power is absurd.  That provision preempts the authority of political subdivisions to regulate &#x93;a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder 
				<em>
					with respect to the transportation of property.

				&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  The italicized language massively limits the scope of preemption to include only laws, regulations, and other provisions that single out for special treatment &#x93;motor carriers of property.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c).  States

				and trucks that may enter highways or pass over bridges, and other regulations that do not target motor carriers &#x93;with respect to the transportation of property.&#x94;  In addition, the exception contained in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) allows a State&#x97;but not a political subdivision&#x97;to apply special safety rules (rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94;) to motor carriers of property.

						 Not only is this point (as the text proceeds to discuss) irrelevant in principle; it is misleading in its description of fact, suggesting that the two neighboring sections produce the same result with different language.  It is true enough that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), like &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), permits both state and local regulation.  But 14501(c)(2)(C), unlike &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), also permits regulation by a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;

						 The Court thinks these examples are &#x93;hardly comparable&#x94; to &#xA7;14501(c) because many involve Spending Clause legislation.  Ante, at 11&#x96;12.  A sufficient answer is that one of them does not, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7410.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;7410</a> (1994 ed.) (Clean Air Act), and that other examples not involving Spending Clause legislation could be added, see, e.g.,

But in any event, a siphoning off of the States&#x92; &#x93;historic powers&#x94; to delegate has equally been achieved, whether it has come about through the coercion of deprivation of Spending Clause funds or through other means.  The point is that it is not unusual for Congress to interfere in this matter.

						 The Court thinks the Clean Air Act is a bad example merely because a State can rely on political subdivisions to enforce the State&#x92;s im-plementation plan.  Ante, at 12&#x96;13, n. 4; see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7407.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;7407(a)</a>.  So what?  Only States may adopt implementation plans; this duty cannot be delegated to localities.  Moreover, as I explain n. 4, infra, the statute at issue here is no different.  Under

						 This interpretation of the statutory scheme &#x93;introduces an inter-pretive conundrum of another kind,&#x94; the Court asserts, because &#xA7;14501(c)(1) declares that a political subdivision may not &#x93;enact or enforce&#x94; laws, regulations, or other provisions relating to motor carriers of property.  Ante, at 9.  In the Court&#x92;s view, if the term &#x93;State&#x94; does not include &#x93;subdivision of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(1) will prevent a State from relying on localities to &#x93;enforce&#x94; rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority.&#x94;  Ibid.  But the conclusion that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents a political subdivision from enforcing regulations enacted by the State can only be reached by ignoring (for this issue) the rule that the Court is so insistent upon elsewhere: that federal interference with the &#x93;historic powers of the States&#x94; must be evinced by a &#x93;plain statement,&#x94; Gregory v. Ashcroft, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/501/452" class="subref" title="subref">501 U. S. 452</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">461</a> (1991)
.  A natural reading of the phrase &#x93;a &#x2026; political subdivision of a State . . . may not enact or enforce a law&#x94;&#x97;and a reading faithful to Gregory&#x92;s plain statement rule&#x97;is that a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws.  The Court believes this reading &#x93;raises the startling possibility,&#x94; ante, at 10, n. 3, that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents States but not political subdivisions from enforcing previously enacted State regulations relating to motor carriage of property.  I think not.  A possibility so startling (and unlikely to occur) is well enough precluded by the rule that a statute should not be interpreted to produce absurd results.  The municipalities&#x92; reserved power to enforce state law does not include the power to enforce state law that the State has no continuing power to enact or enforce.

Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction &#xA7;266, p. 349 (1891).  The only conceivable reason for this specification of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; apart from &#x93;State&#x94; is 
				<em>
					to establish

				, in the rule, the two

				The situation is comparable to the following hypothetical using the term &#x93;football&#x94; (which may be used to include soccer, see Webster&#x92;s New International Dictionary 983 (2d ed. 1950)): Assume a statute which says that &#x93;football and soccer shall not be played on the town green&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(1)), except that &#x93;football and soccer may be played on Saturdays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C)), &#x93;football and soccer may be played on summer nights&#x94; (14501(c)(3)(A)), and &#x93;football may be played on Mondays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				(2)(A)).  In today&#x92;s opinion, the Court says soccer may be played on Mondays.  I think it clear that soccer is not to be regarded as a subset of football but as a separate category.  And the same is true of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; here.

				The Court reaches the opposite conclusion merely because &#xA7;14501(c) exhibits uneven drafting.  First the Court notes that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) does not &#x93;trac[k] the language and structure of the general preemption rule.&#x94;  
				<em>

Whereas other exceptions to the rule refer to the authority of a State or other political entity &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) merely refers to the &#x93;safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Second, the Court notes that another exception to the preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), is &#x93;stated with similar economy.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante

				, at 8.  It addresses merely the

					subject 
				</em>
				of regulation (transportation of household goods) instead of both the subject and the 
				<em>
					source
				</em>
				 of regulation (a State, political subdivision, or political authority of 2 or more States).  This has, the Court notes, the same effect as its neighbor, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), of permitting both state and local regulation.

				  These inconsistencies in the statute&#x92;s drafting style, the Court contends, undermine the conclusion we would ordinarily draw from the absence of the term &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).

				The weakness of this argument should be self-evident.  How can inconsistencies of style, 
				<em>
					on points that have nothing to do with the issue of separating state and local authority
				</em>
				, cause the text&#x92;s crystal-clear distinction between state and local authority to disappear?  It would certainly reflect more orderly draftsmanship if the statute consistently used the formulation &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; rather than replacing it in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) with the equivalent phrase &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94;; and if the statute referred to subject matter alone (&#xE0; la &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B)) either never at all, or else 
				<em>
					whenever
				</em>
				 the exception applied to all three categories of States, subdivisions of States, and political authorities of 2 or more States.  But it is impossible to imagine how this imperfect draftsmanship in unrelated matters casts any doubt upon the precise meaning of the subject-matter-plus-source provisions where they appear. Unless the Court is appealing to some hitherto unknown canon of interpretation&#x97;perhaps (borrowed from the law of evidence) 
				<em>
					negligens in uno, negligens in omnibus
				</em>
				&#x97;the diverse styles of &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s exceptions have nothing to do with whether we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear.

				What is truly anomalous here is not the fact that the terminology of &#xA7;14501(c) is diverse with regard to presently irrelevant matters, but the fact that the Court has today come up with a judicial interpretation of &#xA7;14501(c) that renders the term &#x93;political subdivision of a State,&#x94; which appears throughout,

				Lacking support in the text of the statute, the Court invokes federalism concerns to justify its decision.  &#x93;Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x91;clear and manifest purpose&#x92; to the contrary,&#x94; the Court reasons, &#x93;federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.&#x94;

				With such major impositions as these already on the books, treating &#xA7;14501(c)(1) as some extraordinary federal obstruction of state allocation of power is absurd.  That provision preempts the authority of political subdivisions to regulate &#x93;a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder 
				<em>
					with respect to the transportation of property.

				&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  The italicized language massively limits the scope of preemption to include only laws, regulations, and other provisions that single out for special treatment &#x93;motor carriers of property.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c).  States

				and trucks that may enter highways or pass over bridges, and other regulations that do not target motor carriers &#x93;with respect to the transportation of property.&#x94;  In addition, the exception contained in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) allows a State&#x97;but not a political subdivision&#x97;to apply special safety rules (rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94;) to motor carriers of property.

						 Not only is this point (as the text proceeds to discuss) irrelevant in principle; it is misleading in its description of fact, suggesting that the two neighboring sections produce the same result with different language.  It is true enough that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), like &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), permits both state and local regulation.  But 14501(c)(2)(C), unlike &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), also permits regulation by a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;

						 The Court thinks these examples are &#x93;hardly comparable&#x94; to &#xA7;14501(c) because many involve Spending Clause legislation.  Ante, at 11&#x96;12.  A sufficient answer is that one of them does not, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7410.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;7410</a> (1994 ed.) (Clean Air Act), and that other examples not involving Spending Clause legislation could be added, see, e.g.,

But in any event, a siphoning off of the States&#x92; &#x93;historic powers&#x94; to delegate has equally been achieved, whether it has come about through the coercion of deprivation of Spending Clause funds or through other means.  The point is that it is not unusual for Congress to interfere in this matter.

Only States may adopt implementation plans; this duty cannot be delegated to localities.  Moreover, as I explain n. 4, infra, the statute at issue here is no different.  Under

						 This interpretation of the statutory scheme &#x93;introduces an inter-pretive conundrum of another kind,&#x94; the Court asserts, because &#xA7;14501(c)(1) declares that a political subdivision may not &#x93;enact or enforce&#x94; laws, regulations, or other provisions relating to motor carriers of property.  Ante, at 9.  In the Court&#x92;s view, if the term &#x93;State&#x94; does not include &#x93;subdivision of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(1) will prevent a State from relying on localities to &#x93;enforce&#x94; rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority.&#x94;  Ibid.  But the conclusion that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents a political subdivision from enforcing regulations enacted by the State can only be reached by ignoring (for this issue) the rule that the Court is so insistent upon elsewhere: that federal interference with the &#x93;historic powers of the States&#x94; must be evinced by a &#x93;plain statement,&#x94; Gregory v. Ashcroft, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/501/452" class="subref" title="subref">501 U. S. 452</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">461</a> (1991)
.  A natural reading of the phrase &#x93;a &#x2026; political subdivision of a State . . . may not enact or enforce a law&#x94;&#x97;and a reading faithful to Gregory&#x92;s plain statement rule&#x97;is that a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws.  The Court believes this reading &#x93;raises the startling possibility,&#x94; ante, at 10, n. 3, that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents States but not political subdivisions from enforcing previously enacted State regulations relating to motor carriage of property.  I think not.  A possibility so startling (and unlikely to occur) is well enough precluded by the rule that a statute should not be interpreted to produce absurd results.  The municipalities&#x92; reserved power to enforce state law does not include the power to enforce state law that the State has no continuing power to enact or enforce.

Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction &#xA7;266, p. 349 (1891).  The only conceivable reason for this specification of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; apart from &#x93;State&#x94; is 
				<em>
					to establish
				</em>
				, in the rule, the two

				The situation is comparable to the following hypothetical using the term &#x93;football&#x94; (which may be used to include soccer, see Webster&#x92;s New International Dictionary 983 (2d ed. 1950)): Assume a statute which says that &#x93;football and soccer shall not be played on the town green&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(1)), except that &#x93;football and soccer may be played on Saturdays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C)), &#x93;football and soccer may be played on summer nights&#x94; (14501(c)(3)(A)), and &#x93;football may be played on Mondays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				(2)(A)).  In today&#x92;s opinion, the Court says soccer may be played on Mondays.  I think it clear that soccer is not to be regarded as a subset of football but as a separate category.  And the same is true of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; here.

				The Court reaches the opposite conclusion merely because &#xA7;14501(c) exhibits uneven drafting.  First the Court notes that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) does not &#x93;trac[k] the language and structure of the general preemption rule.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  Whereas other exceptions to the rule refer to the authority of a State or other political entity &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) merely refers to the &#x93;safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Second, the Court notes that another exception to the preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), is &#x93;stated with similar economy.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It addresses merely the 
				<em>
					subject 
				</em>
				of regulation (transportation of household goods) instead of both the subject and the 
				<em>
					source
				</em>
				 of regulation (a State, political subdivision, or political authority of 2 or more States).  This has, the Court notes, the same effect as its neighbor, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), of permitting both state and local regulation.

				  These inconsistencies in the statute&#x92;s drafting style, the Court contends, undermine the conclusion we would ordinarily draw from the absence of the term &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The weakness of this argument should be self-evident.  How can inconsistencies of style, 
				<em>
					on points that have nothing to do with the issue of separating state and local authority
				</em>
				, cause the text&#x92;s crystal-clear distinction between state and local authority to disappear?  It would certainly reflect more orderly draftsmanship if the statute consistently used the formulation &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; rather than replacing it in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) with the equivalent phrase &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94;; and if the statute referred to subject matter alone (&#xE0; la &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B)) either never at all, or else 
				<em>
					whenever
				</em>
				 the exception applied to all three categories of States, subdivisions of States, and political authorities of 2 or more States.  But it is impossible to imagine how this imperfect draftsmanship in unrelated matters casts any doubt upon the precise meaning of the subject-matter-plus-source provisions where they appear. Unless the Court is appealing to some hitherto unknown canon of interpretation&#x97;perhaps (borrowed from the law of evidence) 
				<em>
					negligens in uno, negligens in omnibus
				</em>
				&#x97;the diverse styles of &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s exceptions have nothing to do with whether we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear.

				What is truly anomalous here is not the fact that the terminology of &#xA7;14501(c) is diverse with regard to presently irrelevant matters, but the fact that the Court has today come up with a judicial interpretation of &#xA7;14501(c) that renders the term &#x93;political subdivision of a State,&#x94; which appears throughout,

				Lacking support in the text of the statute, the Court invokes federalism concerns to justify its decision.  &#x93;Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x91;clear and manifest purpose&#x92; to the contrary,&#x94; the Court reasons, &#x93;federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.&#x94;

				With such major impositions as these already on the books, treating &#xA7;14501(c)(1) as some extraordinary federal obstruction of state allocation of power is absurd.  That provision preempts the authority of political subdivisions to regulate &#x93;a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder 
				<em>
					with respect to the transportation of property.
				</em>
				&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  The italicized language massively limits the scope of preemption to include only laws, regulations, and other provisions that single out for special treatment &#x93;motor carriers of property.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c).  States

						 Not only is this point (as the text proceeds to discuss) irrelevant in principle; it is misleading in its description of fact, suggesting that the two neighboring sections produce the same result with different language.  It is true enough that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), like &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), permits both state and local regulation.  But 14501(c)(2)(C), unlike &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), also permits regulation by a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;

						 The Court thinks these examples are &#x93;hardly comparable&#x94; to &#xA7;14501(c) because many involve Spending Clause legislation.  Ante, at 11&#x96;12.  A sufficient answer is that one of them does not, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7410.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;7410</a> (1994 ed.) (Clean Air Act), and that other examples not involving Spending Clause legislation could be added, see, e.g.,

But in any event, a siphoning off of the States&#x92; &#x93;historic powers&#x94; to delegate has equally been achieved, whether it has come about through the coercion of deprivation of Spending Clause funds or through other means.  The point is that it is not unusual for Congress to interfere in this matter.

						 This interpretation of the statutory scheme &#x93;introduces an inter-pretive conundrum of another kind,&#x94; the Court asserts, because &#xA7;14501(c)(1) declares that a political subdivision may not &#x93;enact or enforce&#x94; laws, regulations, or other provisions relating to motor carriers of property.  Ante, at 9.  In the Court&#x92;s view, if the term &#x93;State&#x94; does not include &#x93;subdivision of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(1) will prevent a State from relying on localities to &#x93;enforce&#x94; rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority.&#x94;  Ibid.  But the conclusion that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents a political subdivision from enforcing regulations enacted by the State can only be reached by ignoring (for this issue) the rule that the Court is so insistent upon elsewhere: that federal interference with the &#x93;historic powers of the States&#x94; must be evinced by a &#x93;plain statement,&#x94; Gregory v. Ashcroft, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/501/452" class="subref" title="subref">501 U. S. 452</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">461</a> (1991)
.  A natural reading of the phrase &#x93;a &#x2026; political subdivision of a State . . . may not enact or enforce a law&#x94;&#x97;and a reading faithful to Gregory&#x92;s plain statement rule&#x97;is that a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws.  The Court believes this reading &#x93;raises the startling possibility,&#x94; ante, at 10, n. 3, that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents States but not political subdivisions from enforcing previously enacted State regulations relating to motor carriage of property.  I think not.  A possibility so startling (and unlikely to occur) is well enough precluded by the rule that a statute should not be interpreted to produce absurd results.  The municipalities&#x92; reserved power to enforce state law does not include the power to enforce state law that the State has no continuing power to enact or enforce.

				The dispute in the present case arises from the fact that a reference to &#x93;State&#x94; power or authority can be meant to include 
				<em>

				 that power or authority, including the portion exercised by political subdivisions (as, for example, in the ordinary reference to &#x93;the State&#x92;s police power&#x94;); but can also be meant to include only that power or authority exercised at the state level (as, for example, in the phrase &#x93;State and local governmental authority&#x94;).

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">23</a> (1983)
.  The only way to impart some purpose and intent here is to assume that the word &#x93;State&#x94; is used in its narrower sense, so that political subdivisions are not covered by the term.  The Court admits that the rule applied in 
				<em>
					Russello
				</em>
				 &#x93;supports an argument of some force,&#x94;

				 with which &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) excludes political subdivisions.  For the clarity begins not just with the various exceptions, but with the very preemption rule to which the exceptions are appended.  That rule reads:

, the preemption rule would have precisely the same scope if it omitted the reference to &#x93;political subdivision of a State.&#x94;  It is a well-established principle of statutory construction (and of common sense) that when such a situation occurs, when &#x93;two words or expressions are coupled together, one of which generically includes the other, it is obvious that the more general term is used in a meaning excluding the specific one.&#x94;  J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction &#xA7;266, p. 349 (1891).  The only conceivable reason for this specification of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; apart from &#x93;State&#x94; is 
				<em>
					to establish
				</em>
				, in the rule, the two 
				<em>

				The situation is comparable to the following hypothetical using the term &#x93;football&#x94; (which may be used to include soccer, see Webster&#x92;s New International Dictionary 983 (2d ed. 1950)): Assume a statute which says that &#x93;football and soccer shall not be played on the town green&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(1)), except that &#x93;football and soccer may be played on Saturdays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C)), &#x93;football and soccer may be played on summer nights&#x94; (14501(c)(3)(A)), and &#x93;football may be played on Mondays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				(2)(A)).  In today&#x92;s opinion, the Court says soccer may be played on Mondays.  I think it clear that soccer is not to be regarded as a subset of football but as a separate category.  And the same is true of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; here.

				The Court reaches the opposite conclusion merely because &#xA7;14501(c) exhibits uneven drafting.  First the Court notes that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) does not &#x93;trac[k] the language and structure of the general preemption rule.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  Whereas other exceptions to the rule refer to the authority of a State or other political entity &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) merely refers to the &#x93;safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Second, the Court notes that another exception to the preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), is &#x93;stated with similar economy.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It addresses merely the 
				<em>
					subject 
				</em>
				of regulation (transportation of household goods) instead of both the subject and the 
				<em>
					source
				</em>
				 of regulation (a State, political subdivision, or political authority of 2 or more States).  This has, the Court notes, the same effect as its neighbor, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), of permitting both state and local regulation.

				  These inconsistencies in the statute&#x92;s drafting style, the Court contends, undermine the conclusion we would ordinarily draw from the absence of the term &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 9.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The weakness of this argument should be self-evident.  How can inconsistencies of style, 
				<em>
					on points that have nothing to do with the issue of separating state and local authority
				</em>
				, cause the text&#x92;s crystal-clear distinction between state and local authority to disappear?  It would certainly reflect more orderly draftsmanship if the statute consistently used the formulation &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; rather than replacing it in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) with the equivalent phrase &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94;; and if the statute referred to subject matter alone (&#xE0; la &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B)) either never at all, or else 
				<em>
					whenever
				</em>
				 the exception applied to all three categories of States, subdivisions of States, and political authorities of 2 or more States.  But it is impossible to imagine how this imperfect draftsmanship in unrelated matters casts any doubt upon the precise meaning of the subject-matter-plus-source provisions where they appear. Unless the Court is appealing to some hitherto unknown canon of interpretation&#x97;perhaps (borrowed from the law of evidence) 
				<em>
					negligens in uno, negligens in omnibus
				</em>
				&#x97;the diverse styles of &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s exceptions have nothing to do with whether we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				What is truly anomalous here is not the fact that the terminology of &#xA7;14501(c) is diverse with regard to presently irrelevant matters, but the fact that the Court has today come up with a judicial interpretation of &#xA7;14501(c) that renders the term &#x93;political subdivision of a State,&#x94; which appears throughout, 
				<em>

				Lacking support in the text of the statute, the Court invokes federalism concerns to justify its decision.  &#x93;Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x91;clear and manifest purpose&#x92; to the contrary,&#x94; the Court reasons, &#x93;federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.&#x94;

				With such major impositions as these already on the books, treating &#xA7;14501(c)(1) as some extraordinary federal obstruction of state allocation of power is absurd.  That provision preempts the authority of political subdivisions to regulate &#x93;a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder 
				<em>
					with respect to the transportation of property.

				 whether the statute&#x92;s reference to the authority of a &#x93;State&#x94; includes authority possessed by a municipality on delegation from the State.

						 Not only is this point (as the text proceeds to discuss) irrelevant in principle; it is misleading in its description of fact, suggesting that the two neighboring sections produce the same result with different language.  It is true enough that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), like &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), permits both state and local regulation.  But 14501(c)(2)(C), unlike &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), also permits regulation by a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;

						 The Court thinks these examples are &#x93;hardly comparable&#x94; to &#xA7;14501(c) because many involve Spending Clause legislation.  Ante, at 11&#x96;12.  A sufficient answer is that one of them does not, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7410.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;7410</a> (1994 ed.) (Clean Air Act), and that other examples not involving Spending Clause legislation could be added, see, e.g.,

But in any event, a siphoning off of the States&#x92; &#x93;historic powers&#x94; to delegate has equally been achieved, whether it has come about through the coercion of deprivation of Spending Clause funds or through other means.  The point is that it is not unusual for Congress to interfere in this matter.

						 The Court thinks the Clean Air Act is a bad example merely because a State can rely on political subdivisions to enforce the State&#x92;s im-plementation plan.  Ante, at 12&#x96;13, n. 4; see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7407.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;7407(a)</a>.  So what?  Only States may adopt implementation plans; this duty cannot be delegated to localities.  Moreover, as I explain n. 4, infra, the statute at issue here is no different.  Under

						 This interpretation of the statutory scheme &#x93;introduces an inter-pretive conundrum of another kind,&#x94; the Court asserts, because &#xA7;14501(c)(1) declares that a political subdivision may not &#x93;enact or enforce&#x94; laws, regulations, or other provisions relating to motor carriers of property.  Ante, at 9.  In the Court&#x92;s view, if the term &#x93;State&#x94; does not include &#x93;subdivision of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(1) will prevent a State from relying on localities to &#x93;enforce&#x94; rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority.&#x94;  Ibid.  But the conclusion that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents a political subdivision from enforcing regulations enacted by the State can only be reached by ignoring (for this issue) the rule that the Court is so insistent upon elsewhere: that federal interference with the &#x93;historic powers of the States&#x94; must be evinced by a &#x93;plain statement,&#x94; Gregory v. Ashcroft, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/501/452" class="subref" title="subref">501 U. S. 452</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">461</a> (1991)
.  A natural reading of the phrase &#x93;a &#x2026; political subdivision of a State . . . may not enact or enforce a law&#x94;&#x97;and a reading faithful to Gregory&#x92;s plain statement rule&#x97;is that a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws.  The Court believes this reading &#x93;raises the startling possibility,&#x94; ante, at 10, n. 3, that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents States but not political subdivisions from enforcing previously enacted State regulations relating to motor carriage of property.  I think not.  A possibility so startling (and unlikely to occur) is well enough precluded by the rule that a statute should not be interpreted to produce absurd results.  The municipalities&#x92; reserved power to enforce state law does not include the power to enforce state law that the State has no continuing power to enact or enforce.

.  The only way to impart some purpose and intent here is to assume that the word &#x93;State&#x94; is used in its narrower sense, so that political subdivisions are not covered by the term.  The Court admits that the rule applied in

Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction &#xA7;266, p. 349 (1891).  The only conceivable reason for this specification of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; apart from &#x93;State&#x94; is 
				<em>
					to establish
				</em>
				, in the rule, the two 
				<em>

				The situation is comparable to the following hypothetical using the term &#x93;football&#x94; (which may be used to include soccer, see Webster&#x92;s New International Dictionary 983 (2d ed. 1950)): Assume a statute which says that &#x93;football and soccer shall not be played on the town green&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(1)), except that &#x93;football and soccer may be played on Saturdays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C)), &#x93;football and soccer may be played on summer nights&#x94; (14501(c)(3)(A)), and &#x93;football may be played on Mondays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				(2)(A)).  In today&#x92;s opinion, the Court says soccer may be played on Mondays.  I think it clear that soccer is not to be regarded as a subset of football but as a separate category.  And the same is true of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; here.

				The Court reaches the opposite conclusion merely because &#xA7;14501(c) exhibits uneven drafting.  First the Court notes that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) does not &#x93;trac[k] the language and structure of the general preemption rule.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  Whereas other exceptions to the rule refer to the authority of a State or other political entity &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) merely refers to the &#x93;safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Second, the Court notes that another exception to the preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), is &#x93;stated with similar economy.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It addresses merely the 
				<em>
					subject 
				</em>
				of regulation (transportation of household goods) instead of both the subject and the 
				<em>
					source
				</em>
				 of regulation (a State, political subdivision, or political authority of 2 or more States).  This has, the Court notes, the same effect as its neighbor, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), of permitting both state and local regulation.

				  These inconsistencies in the statute&#x92;s drafting style, the Court contends, undermine the conclusion we would ordinarily draw from the absence of the term &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).  
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The weakness of this argument should be self-evident.  How can inconsistencies of style, 
				<em>
					on points that have nothing to do with the issue of separating state and local authority
				</em>
				, cause the text&#x92;s crystal-clear distinction between state and local authority to disappear?  It would certainly reflect more orderly draftsmanship if the statute consistently used the formulation &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; rather than replacing it in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) with the equivalent phrase &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94;; and if the statute referred to subject matter alone (&#xE0; la &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B)) either never at all, or else 
				<em>
					whenever
				</em>
				 the exception applied to all three categories of States, subdivisions of States, and political authorities of 2 or more States.  But it is impossible to imagine how this imperfect draftsmanship in unrelated matters casts any doubt upon the precise meaning of the subject-matter-plus-source provisions where they appear. Unless the Court is appealing to some hitherto unknown canon of interpretation&#x97;perhaps (borrowed from the law of evidence) 
				<em>
					negligens in uno, negligens in omnibus
				</em>
				&#x97;the diverse styles of &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s exceptions have nothing to do with whether we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear.

				What is truly anomalous here is not the fact that the terminology of &#xA7;14501(c) is diverse with regard to presently irrelevant matters, but the fact that the Court has today come up with a judicial interpretation of &#xA7;14501(c) that renders the term &#x93;political subdivision of a State,&#x94; which appears throughout,

				Lacking support in the text of the statute, the Court invokes federalism concerns to justify its decision.  &#x93;Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x91;clear and manifest purpose&#x92; to the contrary,&#x94; the Court reasons, &#x93;federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.&#x94;

				  This &#x93;interference&#x94; of the Federal Government with the States&#x92; &#x93;traditional prerogative &#x2026; to delegate their authority to their constituent parts&#x94; has long been a subject of considerable debate and controversy.  See,

				With such major impositions as these already on the books, treating &#xA7;14501(c)(1) as some extraordinary federal obstruction of state allocation of power is absurd.  That provision preempts the authority of political subdivisions to regulate &#x93;a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder 
				<em>
					with respect to the transportation of property.
				</em>
				&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  The italicized language massively limits the scope of preemption to include only laws, regulations, and other provisions that single out for special treatment &#x93;motor carriers of property.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c).  States 
				<em>

				and trucks that may enter highways or pass over bridges, and other regulations that do not target motor carriers &#x93;with respect to the transportation of property.&#x94;  In addition, the exception contained in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) allows a State&#x97;but not a political subdivision&#x97;to apply special safety rules (rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94;) to motor carriers of property.

						 Not only is this point (as the text proceeds to discuss) irrelevant in principle; it is misleading in its description of fact, suggesting that the two neighboring sections produce the same result with different language.  It is true enough that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), like &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), permits both state and local regulation.  But 14501(c)(2)(C), unlike &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), also permits regulation by a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;

						 The Court thinks these examples are &#x93;hardly comparable&#x94; to &#xA7;14501(c) because many involve Spending Clause legislation.  Ante, at 11&#x96;12.  A sufficient answer is that one of them does not, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7410.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;7410</a> (1994 ed.) (Clean Air Act), and that other examples not involving Spending Clause legislation could be added, see, e.g.,

But in any event, a siphoning off of the States&#x92; &#x93;historic powers&#x94; to delegate has equally been achieved, whether it has come about through the coercion of deprivation of Spending Clause funds or through other means.  The point is that it is not unusual for Congress to interfere in this matter.

						 The Court thinks the Clean Air Act is a bad example merely because a State can rely on political subdivisions to enforce the State&#x92;s im-plementation plan.  Ante, at 12&#x96;13, n. 4; see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7407.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;7407(a)</a>.  So what?  Only States may adopt implementation plans; this duty cannot be delegated to localities.  Moreover, as I explain n. 4, infra, the statute at issue here is no different.  Under

						 This interpretation of the statutory scheme &#x93;introduces an inter-pretive conundrum of another kind,&#x94; the Court asserts, because &#xA7;14501(c)(1) declares that a political subdivision may not &#x93;enact or enforce&#x94; laws, regulations, or other provisions relating to motor carriers of property.  Ante, at 9.  In the Court&#x92;s view, if the term &#x93;State&#x94; does not include &#x93;subdivision of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(1) will prevent a State from relying on localities to &#x93;enforce&#x94; rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority.&#x94;  Ibid.  But the conclusion that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents a political subdivision from enforcing regulations enacted by the State can only be reached by ignoring (for this issue) the rule that the Court is so insistent upon elsewhere: that federal interference with the &#x93;historic powers of the States&#x94; must be evinced by a &#x93;plain statement,&#x94; Gregory v. Ashcroft, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/501/452" class="subref" title="subref">501 U. S. 452</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">461</a> (1991)
.  A natural reading of the phrase &#x93;a &#x2026; political subdivision of a State . . . may not enact or enforce a law&#x94;&#x97;and a reading faithful to Gregory&#x92;s plain statement rule&#x97;is that a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws.  The Court believes this reading &#x93;raises the startling possibility,&#x94; ante, at 10, n. 3, that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents States but not political subdivisions from enforcing previously enacted State regulations relating to motor carriage of property.  I think not.  A possibility so startling (and unlikely to occur) is well enough precluded by the rule that a statute should not be interpreted to produce absurd results.  The municipalities&#x92; reserved power to enforce state law does not include the power to enforce state law that the State has no continuing power to enact or enforce.

				The dispute in the present case arises from the fact that a reference to &#x93;State&#x94; power or authority can be meant to include

				 that power or authority, including the portion exercised by political subdivisions (as, for example, in the ordinary reference to &#x93;the State&#x92;s police power&#x94;); but can also be meant to include only that power or authority exercised at the state level (as, for example, in the phrase &#x93;State and local governmental authority&#x94;).

.  The only way to impart some purpose and intent here is to assume that the word &#x93;State&#x94; is used in its narrower sense, so that political subdivisions are not covered by the term.  The Court admits that the rule applied in

, the preemption rule would have precisely the same scope if it omitted the reference to &#x93;political subdivision of a State.&#x94;  It is a well-established principle of statutory construction (and of common sense) that when such a situation occurs, when &#x93;two words or expressions are coupled together, one of which generically includes the other, it is obvious that the more general term is used in a meaning excluding the specific one.&#x94;  J. Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction &#xA7;266, p. 349 (1891).  The only conceivable reason for this specification of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; apart from &#x93;State&#x94; is 
				<em>
					to establish
				</em>
				, in the rule, the two

				The situation is comparable to the following hypothetical using the term &#x93;football&#x94; (which may be used to include soccer, see Webster&#x92;s New International Dictionary 983 (2d ed. 1950)): Assume a statute which says that &#x93;football and soccer shall not be played on the town green&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(1)), except that &#x93;football and soccer may be played on Saturdays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C)), &#x93;football and soccer may be played on summer nights&#x94; (14501(c)(3)(A)), and &#x93;football may be played on Mondays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				(2)(A)).  In today&#x92;s opinion, the Court says soccer may be played on Mondays.  I think it clear that soccer is not to be regarded as a subset of football but as a separate category.  And the same is true of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; here.

				The Court reaches the opposite conclusion merely because &#xA7;14501(c) exhibits uneven drafting.  First the Court notes that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) does not &#x93;trac[k] the language and structure of the general preemption rule.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  Whereas other exceptions to the rule refer to the authority of a State or other political entity &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) merely refers to the &#x93;safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Second, the Court notes that another exception to the preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), is &#x93;stated with similar economy.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It addresses merely the 
				<em>
					subject 
				</em>
				of regulation (transportation of household goods) instead of both the subject and the 
				<em>
					source
				</em>
				 of regulation (a State, political subdivision, or political authority of 2 or more States).  This has, the Court notes, the same effect as its neighbor, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), of permitting both state and local regulation.

				The weakness of this argument should be self-evident.  How can inconsistencies of style,

					on points that have nothing to do with the issue of separating state and local authority

				, cause the text&#x92;s crystal-clear distinction between state and local authority to disappear?  It would certainly reflect more orderly draftsmanship if the statute consistently used the formulation &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; rather than replacing it in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) with the equivalent phrase &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94;; and if the statute referred to subject matter alone (&#xE0; la &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B)) either never at all, or else

				 the exception applied to all three categories of States, subdivisions of States, and political authorities of 2 or more States.  But it is impossible to imagine how this imperfect draftsmanship in unrelated matters casts any doubt upon the precise meaning of the subject-matter-plus-source provisions where they appear. Unless the Court is appealing to some hitherto unknown canon of interpretation&#x97;perhaps (borrowed from the law of evidence) 
				<em>

				&#x97;the diverse styles of &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s exceptions have nothing to do with whether we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear.

				What is truly anomalous here is not the fact that the terminology of &#xA7;14501(c) is diverse with regard to presently irrelevant matters, but the fact that the Court has today come up with a judicial interpretation of &#xA7;14501(c) that renders the term &#x93;political subdivision of a State,&#x94; which appears throughout,

				Lacking support in the text of the statute, the Court invokes federalism concerns to justify its decision.  &#x93;Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x91;clear and manifest purpose&#x92; to the contrary,&#x94; the Court reasons, &#x93;federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.&#x94;

				With such major impositions as these already on the books, treating &#xA7;14501(c)(1) as some extraordinary federal obstruction of state allocation of power is absurd.  That provision preempts the authority of political subdivisions to regulate &#x93;a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder 
				<em>
					with respect to the transportation of property.
				</em>
				&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  The italicized language massively limits the scope of preemption to include only laws, regulations, and other provisions that single out for special treatment &#x93;motor carriers of property.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c).  States 
				<em>

				and trucks that may enter highways or pass over bridges, and other regulations that do not target motor carriers &#x93;with respect to the transportation of property.&#x94;  In addition, the exception contained in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) allows a State&#x97;but not a political subdivision&#x97;to apply special safety rules (rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94;) to motor carriers of property.

						 Not only is this point (as the text proceeds to discuss) irrelevant in principle; it is misleading in its description of fact, suggesting that the two neighboring sections produce the same result with different language.  It is true enough that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), like &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), permits both state and local regulation.  But 14501(c)(2)(C), unlike &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), also permits regulation by a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;

						 The Court thinks these examples are &#x93;hardly comparable&#x94; to &#xA7;14501(c) because many involve Spending Clause legislation.  Ante, at 11&#x96;12.  A sufficient answer is that one of them does not, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7410.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;7410</a> (1994 ed.) (Clean Air Act), and that other examples not involving Spending Clause legislation could be added, see, e.g., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1313.html#d" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;1313(d)</a> (Clean Water Act).  But in any event, a siphoning off of the States&#x92; &#x93;historic powers&#x94; to delegate has equally been achieved, whether it has come about through the coercion of deprivation of Spending Clause funds or through other means.  The point is that it is not unusual for Congress to interfere in this matter.

						 The Court thinks the Clean Air Act is a bad example merely because a State can rely on political subdivisions to enforce the State&#x92;s im-plementation plan.  Ante, at 12&#x96;13, n. 4; see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7407.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;7407(a)</a>.  So what?  Only States may adopt implementation plans; this duty cannot be delegated to localities.  Moreover, as I explain n. 4, infra, the statute at issue here is no different.  Under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/49/14501.html#c_1" class="subref" title="subref">49 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(c)(1)</a> and (c)(2)(A), a State may enact regulations pursuant to its &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94; and rely on localities to enforce those regulations.

						 This interpretation of the statutory scheme &#x93;introduces an inter-pretive conundrum of another kind,&#x94; the Court asserts, because &#xA7;14501(c)(1) declares that a political subdivision may not &#x93;enact or enforce&#x94; laws, regulations, or other provisions relating to motor carriers of property.  Ante, at 9.  In the Court&#x92;s view, if the term &#x93;State&#x94; does not include &#x93;subdivision of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(1) will prevent a State from relying on localities to &#x93;enforce&#x94; rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority.&#x94;  Ibid.  But the conclusion that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents a political subdivision from enforcing regulations enacted by the State can only be reached by ignoring (for this issue) the rule that the Court is so insistent upon elsewhere: that federal interference with the &#x93;historic powers of the States&#x94; must be evinced by a &#x93;plain statement,&#x94; Gregory v. Ashcroft, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/501/452" class="subref" title="subref">501 U. S. 452</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">461</a> (1991)
.  A natural reading of the phrase &#x93;a &#x2026; political subdivision of a State . . . may not enact or enforce a law&#x94;&#x97;and a reading faithful to Gregory&#x92;s plain statement rule&#x97;is that a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws.  The Court believes this reading &#x93;raises the startling possibility,&#x94; ante, at 10, n. 3, that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents States but not political subdivisions from enforcing previously enacted State regulations relating to motor carriage of property.  I think not.  A possibility so startling (and unlikely to occur) is well enough precluded by the rule that a statute should not be interpreted to produce absurd results.  The municipalities&#x92; reserved power to enforce state law does not include the power to enforce state law that the State has no continuing power to enact or enforce.

				The situation is comparable to the following hypothetical using the term &#x93;football&#x94; (which may be used to include soccer, see Webster&#x92;s New International Dictionary 983 (2d ed. 1950)): Assume a statute which says that &#x93;football and soccer shall not be played on the town green&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(1)), except that &#x93;football and soccer may be played on Saturdays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C)), &#x93;football and soccer may be played on summer nights&#x94; (14501(c)(3)(A)), and &#x93;football may be played on Mondays&#x94; (&#xA7;14501(c)
				<span class="softbreak"/>
				(2)(A)).  In today&#x92;s opinion, the Court says soccer may be played on Mondays.  I think it clear that soccer is not to be regarded as a subset of football but as a separate category.  And the same is true of &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; here.

				The Court reaches the opposite conclusion merely because &#xA7;14501(c) exhibits uneven drafting.  First the Court notes that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) does not &#x93;trac[k] the language and structure of the general preemption rule.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  Whereas other exceptions to the rule refer to the authority of a State or other political entity &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) merely refers to the &#x93;safety regulatory authority of a State.&#x94;  Second, the Court notes that another exception to the preemption rule, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), is &#x93;stated with similar economy.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8.  It addresses merely the 
				<em>
					subject 
				</em>
				of regulation (transportation of household goods) instead of both the subject and the 
				<em>
					source
				</em>
				 of regulation (a State, political subdivision, or political authority of 2 or more States).  This has, the Court notes, the same effect as its neighbor, &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), of permitting both state and local regulation.

				  These inconsistencies in the statute&#x92;s drafting style, the Court contends, undermine the conclusion we would ordinarily draw from the absence of the term &#x93;political subdivision&#x94; in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A).

				The weakness of this argument should be self-evident.  How can inconsistencies of style, 
				<em>
					on points that have nothing to do with the issue of separating state and local authority
				</em>
				, cause the text&#x92;s crystal-clear distinction between state and local authority to disappear?  It would certainly reflect more orderly draftsmanship if the statute consistently used the formulation &#x93;to enact or enforce a law, regulation, or other provision,&#x94; rather than replacing it in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) with the equivalent phrase &#x93;regulatory authority of a State&#x94;; and if the statute referred to subject matter alone (&#xE0; la &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B)) either never at all, or else 
				<em>
					whenever
				</em>
				 the exception applied to all three categories of States, subdivisions of States, and political authorities of 2 or more States.  But it is impossible to imagine how this imperfect draftsmanship in unrelated matters casts any doubt upon the precise meaning of the subject-matter-plus-source provisions where they appear. Unless the Court is appealing to some hitherto unknown canon of interpretation&#x97;perhaps (borrowed from the law of evidence) 
				<em>
					negligens in uno, negligens in omnibus
				</em>
				&#x97;the diverse styles of &#xA7;14501(c)&#x92;s exceptions have nothing to do with whether we should take seriously the references to States and subdivisions of States where they appear.

				What is truly anomalous here is not the fact that the terminology of &#xA7;14501(c) is diverse with regard to presently irrelevant matters, but the fact that the Court has today come up with a judicial interpretation of &#xA7;14501(c) that renders the term &#x93;political subdivision of a State,&#x94; which appears throughout,

				Lacking support in the text of the statute, the Court invokes federalism concerns to justify its decision.  &#x93;Absent a basis more reliable than statutory language insufficient to demonstrate a &#x91;clear and manifest purpose&#x92; to the contrary,&#x94; the Court reasons, &#x93;federal courts should resist attribution to Congress of a design to disturb a State&#x92;s decision on the division of authority between the State&#x92;s central and local units over safety on municipal streets and roads.&#x94;

				With such major impositions as these already on the books, treating &#xA7;14501(c)(1) as some extraordinary federal obstruction of state allocation of power is absurd.  That provision preempts the authority of political subdivisions to regulate &#x93;a price, route, or service of any motor carrier &#x2026; or any motor private carrier, broker, or freight forwarder 
				<em>
					with respect to the transportation of property.
				</em>
				&#x94;  (Emphasis added.)  The italicized language massively limits the scope of preemption to include only laws, regulations, and other provisions that single out for special treatment &#x93;motor carriers of property.&#x94;  &#xA7;14501(c).  States 
				<em>
					and political sub-divisions

				fic safety laws, general restrictions on the weight of cars

				and trucks that may enter highways or pass over bridges, and other regulations that do not target motor carriers &#x93;with respect to the transportation of property.&#x94;  In addition, the exception contained in &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(A) allows a State&#x97;but not a political subdivision&#x97;to apply special safety rules (rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94;) to motor carriers of property.

						 Not only is this point (as the text proceeds to discuss) irrelevant in principle; it is misleading in its description of fact, suggesting that the two neighboring sections produce the same result with different language.  It is true enough that &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(C), like &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), permits both state and local regulation.  But 14501(c)(2)(C), unlike &#xA7;14501(c)(2)(B), also permits regulation by a &#x93;political authority of 2 or more States.&#x94;

						 The Court thinks these examples are &#x93;hardly comparable&#x94; to &#xA7;14501(c) because many involve Spending Clause legislation.  Ante, at 11&#x96;12.  A sufficient answer is that one of them does not, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7410.html" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;7410</a> (1994 ed.) (Clean Air Act), and that other examples not involving Spending Clause legislation could be added, see, e.g., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/1313.html#d" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;1313(d)</a> (Clean Water Act).  But in any event, a siphoning off of the States&#x92; &#x93;historic powers&#x94; to delegate has equally been achieved, whether it has come about through the coercion of deprivation of Spending Clause funds or through other means.  The point is that it is not unusual for Congress to interfere in this matter.

						 The Court thinks the Clean Air Act is a bad example merely because a State can rely on political subdivisions to enforce the State&#x92;s im-plementation plan.  Ante, at 12&#x96;13, n. 4; see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/7407.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;7407(a)</a>.  So what?  Only States may adopt implementation plans; this duty cannot be delegated to localities.  Moreover, as I explain n. 4, infra, the statute at issue here is no different.  Under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/49/14501.html#c_1" class="subref" title="subref">49 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;14501(c)(1)</a> and (c)(2)(A), a State may enact regulations pursuant to its &#x93;safety regulatory authority&#x94; and rely on localities to enforce those regulations.

						 This interpretation of the statutory scheme &#x93;introduces an inter-pretive conundrum of another kind,&#x94; the Court asserts, because &#xA7;14501(c)(1) declares that a political subdivision may not &#x93;enact or enforce&#x94; laws, regulations, or other provisions relating to motor carriers of property.  Ante, at 9.  In the Court&#x92;s view, if the term &#x93;State&#x94; does not include &#x93;subdivision of a State,&#x94; &#xA7;14501(c)(1) will prevent a State from relying on localities to &#x93;enforce&#x94; rules adopted under its &#x93;safety regulatory authority.&#x94;  Ibid.  But the conclusion that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents a political subdivision from enforcing regulations enacted by the State can only be reached by ignoring (for this issue) the rule that the Court is so insistent upon elsewhere: that federal interference with the &#x93;historic powers of the States&#x94; must be evinced by a &#x93;plain statement,&#x94; Gregory v. Ashcroft, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/501/452" class="subref" title="subref">501 U. S. 452</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">461</a> (1991)
.  A natural reading of the phrase &#x93;a &#x2026; political subdivision of a State . . . may not enact or enforce a law&#x94;&#x97;and a reading faithful to Gregory&#x92;s plain statement rule&#x97;is that a political subdivision may not enact new laws or enforce its previously enacted laws.  The Court believes this reading &#x93;raises the startling possibility,&#x94; ante, at 10, n. 3, that &#xA7;14501(c)(1) prevents States but not political subdivisions from enforcing previously enacted State regulations relating to motor carriage of property.  I think not.  A possibility so startling (and unlikely to occur) is well enough precluded by the rule that a statute should not be interpreted to produce absurd results.  The municipalities&#x92; reserved power to enforce state law does not include the power to enforce state law that the State has no continuing power to enact or enforce.
