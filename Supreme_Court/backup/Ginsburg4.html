				Petitioner Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA or Union), a private-sector labor organization covered by the Railway Labor Act (RLA), represents, as exclusive bargaining agent, pilots employed by Delta Air Lines (Delta).  The collective-bargaining agreement between ALPA and Delta includes an &#x93;agency shop&#x94; clause that requires nonunion Delta pilots to pay ALPA a monthly service charge for representing them.  For 1992, the first year ALPA collected an &#x93;agency fee&#x94; under the agency-shop agreement, the Union ultimately determined that 19 percent of its expenses were not germane to collective bargaining.  Accordingly, ALPA collected an agency fee that amounted to 81 percent of its members&#x92; dues.  Alleging that the Union had overstated the percentage of its expenditures genuinely attributable to &#x93;germane&#x94; activities, respondents, 153 Delta pilots, challenged in this federal-court action the manner in which ALPA calculated agency fees.  Under ALPA&#x92;s &#x93;Policies and Procedures Applicable to Agency Fees,&#x94; adopted to comply with the &#x93;impartial decisionmaker&#x94; requirement set forth in

When 174 Delta pilots (including 91 of the respondents) filed timely objections to the 1992 agency-fee calculation, ALPA treated the objects as a request for arbitration and referred them to the AAA for resolution in a single, consolidated proceeding.  The arbitrator declined to stay the arbitration in deference to the court proceeding, and sustained ALPA&#x92;s calculation in substantial part.  The District Court then granted ALPA&#x92;s motion for summary judgment, concluding,

				</em>
				 that pilots seeking to challenge the fee calculation must exhaust arbitral remedies before proceeding in court.  Reversing, the Court of Appeals found no legal basis for requiring objectors to arbitrate agency-fee challenges when they had not agreed to do so.  Having determined that the arbitrator&#x92;s decision was no longer part of the legal picture, the appellate court remanded the case to the District Court.

ALPA&#x92;s assertion of the efficiency served by requiring objectors to proceed first to arbitration, thereby gaining definition of the scope of the dispute, overstates the difficulties entailed in holding a federal-court hearing without a preparatory arbitration, and is answered by conscientious management of the pretrial process to guard against abuse, not by a judicially imposed exhaustion requirement.  Genuine as the Union&#x92;s interest in avoiding multiple proceedings may be, that interest does not overwhelm objectors&#x92; resistance to arbitration to which they did not consent, and their election to proceed immediately to court for adjudication of their federal rights.

				An &#x93;agency shop&#x94; arrangement permits a union, obliged to act on behalf of all employees in the bargaining unit, to charge nonunion workers their fair share of the costs of the representation.  The purposes for which a union may spend the &#x93;agency fee&#x94; paid by nonmembers, however, are circumscribed by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> (when public employers are involved) and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) or Railway Labor Act (RLA) (when private employers subject to their provisions are involved).  In

				&#x92;s &#x93;impartial decisionmaker&#x94; requirement by referring all fee disputes to a neutral arbitrator.  In the action now before us, nonunion pilots challenged the agency fee collected by the Union in 1992.  ALPA urged that the challengers must exhaust the arbitration process before pursuing judicial remedies.  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the pilots resisting the agency fee may proceed at once in federal court.  We hold, in accord with the Court of Appeals, that employees need not submit fee disputes to arbitration when they have never agreed to do so.

				ALPA represents, as exclusive bargaining agent, pilots employed by most United States commercial air carriers, including Delta Air Lines (Delta).  In November 1991, ALPA and Delta amended their collective-bargaining agreement to include, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, an &#x93;agency shop&#x94; clause.  That clause, similar to provisions in ALPA&#x92;s agreements with other carriers, required each pilot who was not an ALPA member to pay the Union a monthly &#x93;service charge as a contribution for the administration of [the collective- bargaining agreement] and the representation of such employee.&#x94;  App. 31.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				On December 12, 1991, five Delta pilots filed this action against ALPA and Delta in the District Court for the District of Columbia.  Their complaint charged that the &#x93;agency shop&#x94; clause was unlawful on its face.  (Three of the original plaintiffs, plus 150 Delta pilots who subsequently intervened, are respondents here; the other two original plaintiffs were dismissed from the case for reasons unrelated to the issue we resolve.  Delta was also dismissed from the case on grounds not pertinent here.)  The pilots unsuccessfully moved for a preliminary injunction against implementation of the agency shop arrangement, and ALPA began collecting agency fees on January 1, 1992.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1992, ALPA charged its members monthly dues of 2.35 percent of each pilot&#x92;s earnings.  The Union ultimately determined, in its final, audited &#x93;Statement of Germane and Nongermane Expenses&#x94; (SGNE) for 1992, that 19 percent of ALPA&#x92;s expenses for that year were not germane to collective bargaining.  Accordingly, the Union adjusted fees charged nonmembers to equal 81 percent of the amount members paid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On October 8, 1992, some months after the Union had begun to collect agency fees, the pilots moved to amend their complaint to add a count challenging the manner in which ALPA calculated the fee.  They alleged, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, that ALPA had overstated the percentage of its expenditures genuinely attributable to &#x93;germane&#x94; activities.  The District Court granted the motion to amend on August 2, 1993.  The pilots&#x92; original facial challenges to the agency-shop clause were later resolved in the Union&#x92;s favor on summary judgment (a matter the pilots did not contest on appeal).  Thus, the challenge to the 1992 agency fee calculation is the only claim before us.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Under ALPA&#x92;s &#x93;Policies and Procedures Applicable to Agency Fees,&#x94; pilots who object to the fee calculation may request arbitration under procedures the American Arbitration Association (AAA) devised to resolve such disputes.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 69&#x96;70.  One hundred seventy-four Delta pilots filed timely objections with the Union after receiving the 1992 SGNE.  ALPA treated those objections as requests for arbitration and referred them to the AAA.  On October 15, 1993, the AAA appointed an arbitrator to resolve the objections in a single, consolidated proceeding.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The objectors included 91 of the 153 pilots who are respondents here.  (The other 62 respondents intervened in the lawsuit but were not parties to the arbitration.)  Preferring to pursue their challenges to ALPA&#x92;s agency-fee calculation in the context of their ongoing federal-court action, the respondent-objectors asked the AAA to suspend the arbitration.  The AAA referred that request to the arbitrator, who declined to defer to the federal-court litigation.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 106.  After the District Court denied a motion to enjoin the arbitration, 
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 111&#x96;114, respondents&#x92; counsel entered a &#x93;conditional appearance&#x94; in the arbitral proceedings.  The arbitrator held hearings in January, February, and March 1994.  He ultimately sustained the Union&#x92;s agency fee calculation in substantial part, although he concluded that &#x93;nongermane&#x94; expenses made up 21.49 percent of the union&#x92;s budget, not 19 percent as the Union had determined.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a&#x96;115a, 158a&#x96;161a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After the arbitrator issued his decision, ALPA moved for summary judgment in the federal-court action.  Granting the motion, the District Court concluded that pilots seeking to challenge the Union&#x92;s agency-fee calculation must exhaust arbitral remedies before proceeding in court.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 26a&#x96;31a.  Accordingly, the court held, the 62 respondents who did not join the arbitration were bound by the arbitrator&#x92;s decision.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 32a.  The other 91 respondents, the District Court ruled, qualified for clear-error review of the arbitrator&#x92;s fact findings and 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 review of all legal issues.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 31a.  Determining that the arbitrator had committed no error of law or clear error of fact, the court sustained his decision.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  108 F. 3d 1415 (1997).  That court found &#x93;no legal basis&#x94; for requiring objectors to arbitrate agency-fee challenges unless they had agreed to do so (as respondents had not).  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 1421 (emphasis deleted).  It therefore concluded that &#x93;the arbitrator&#x92;s decision [was] no longer a part of the legal picture,&#x94; and for that reason the case &#x93;must be remanded.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 1422.  We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. ___ (1997), limited to the question whether an objector must exhaust a union-provided arbitration process before bringing an agency-fee challenge in federal court, a matter on which the Courts of Appeals have reached differing conclusions.

, we upheld the constitutionality of agency shop agreements made by government employers with their workers&#x92; exclusive bargaining representatives.  As the Court explained, imposition of agency fees under the RLA &#x93;is constitutionally justified by the legislative assessment of the important contribution of the union shop to the system of labor relations established by Congress,&#x94; and &#x93;[t]he same important government interests &#x2026; presumptively support&#x94; agency shop arrangements in the public sector.

				The Union, it is true, acted to comply with this Court&#x92;s decision in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 rather than out of its own unconstrained choice.  But 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirement of &#x93;a reasonably prompt decision by an impartial decisionmaker,&#x94; 475 U. S., at 307, aims to protect the interest of objectors by affording them access to a neutral forum in which their objections can be resolved swiftly; nothing in our decision purports to compel objectors to pursue that remedy.  See 
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 307 (&#x93;The nonunion employee, whose 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights are affected by the agency shop itself and who bears the burden of objecting, is entitled to have his objections addressed in an expeditious, fair, and objective manner.&#x94;).  Indeed, 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s emphasis on the need for a speedy remedy weighs against exhaustion, even through an arbitration procedure intended to be expeditious, as an essential prerequisite to federal-court consideration of nonmember challenges.  See 
				<em>
					McCarthy
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;[A]dministrative remedies need not be pursued if the litigant&#x92;s interests in immediate judicial review outweigh the government&#x92;s interests in the efficiency or administrative autonomy that the exhaustion doctrine is designed to further.&#x94;) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We resist reading 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 in a manner that might frustrate its very purpose, to advance the swift, fair, and final settlement of objectors&#x92; rights.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Against these concerns, ALPA stresses the asserted efficiency gains of requiring objectors to proceed to arbitration first.  The Union asserts:  &#x93;It is difficult to conceive how a court could fairly try an agency-fee dispute 
				<em>
					ab initio
				</em>
				, given that the plaintiffs who challenge an agency-fee calculation are not required to state any grounds whatsoever for their challenge.&#x94;  Reply Brief 6&#x96;7.

				ALPA overstates the difficulties of holding a federal-court hearing without a preparatory arbitration.  We have held that &#x93;the nonunion employee has the burden of raising an objection, but that the union retains the burden of proof.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 475 U. S., at 306.  And when pursuing the union&#x92;s 
				<em>

				<em>
					specific
				</em>

				<em>
					Abood
				</em>
				, 431 U. S., at 241 (emphasis in original).  In stating that the &#x93;nonmember&#x92;s &#x91;burden&#x92; is simply the obligation to make his objection known,&#x94; 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 475 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 306, n. 16, however, we did not hold that a federal-court plaintiff can file a generally phrased complaint, then sit back and require the union to prove the &#x93;germaneness&#x94; of its expenditures without a clue as to &#x93;which of its thousands of expenditures&#x94; the objectors oppose.  Reply Brief 4.  Agency fee challengers, like all other civil litigants, must make their objections known with the degree of specificity appropriate at each stage of litigation their case reaches:  motion to dismiss; motion for summary judgment; pretrial conference.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The very purpose of 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s notice requirement is to provide employees sufficient information to enable them to identify the expenditures that, in their view, the union has improperly classified as germane.  See 475 U. S., at 306&#x96;307.  With the 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 notice, plus any additional information developed through reasonable discovery, an objector can be expected to point to the expenditures or classes of expenditures he or she finds questionable.  Although the union must establish that those expenditures were in fact germane, the shifted burden of proof provides no warrant for blocking dissenting employees from bringing their claims in federal court in the first instance, if that is their preference.  The answer to ALPA&#x92;s efficiency concern lies in conscientious management of the pretrial process to guard against abuse, not in a judicially imposed exhaustion requirement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Moreover, the degree to which an exhaustion requirement would reduce the burden on the courts is uncertain.  To the extent that the arbitrator does not sustain an objection to the union&#x92;s fee calculation, exhaustion would require the objector to traverse two layers of procedure rather than one.

            </a>
				  Furthermore, if the union&#x92;s arbitration process in fact operates to provide an inexpensive, swift and sure remedy for agency-fee errors, dissenting employees may avail themselves of that process even if not required to do so.  Cf.

 (under a &#x93; &#x91;free market&#x92; system&#x94; of no required exhaustion, &#x93;litigants are free to pursue administrative remedies if they truly appear to be cheaper, more efficient, and more effective&#x94;).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Union may, nonetheless, face the prospect of defending its fee calculation simultaneously in judicial and arbitral fora.  We note that unions do not lack means to limit the expense and disruption occasioned by multiple fee challenges:  objections may be consolidated for consideration in a single arbitration, for example, and agency-fee litigation may be consolidated in a single district court.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1404.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;1404</a>.  But genuine as the Union&#x92;s interest in avoiding multiple proceedings may be, that interest does not overwhelm objectors&#x92; resistance to arbitration to which they did not consent, and their election to proceed immediately to court for adjudication of their federal rights.

						 Amicus National Education Association (NEA) argues that the question before us is one not of exhaustion but of ripeness.  Illegality depends on the spending of compelled agency fees for ideological purposes, NEA maintains, not simply the initial collection of those fees; hence, an objector has no basis for filing suit until the arbitrator has ruled and the disputed amounts are released from escrow.  See Brief for National Education Association as Amicus Curiae 18&#x96;20.  Petitioner, in its reply brief, endorses NEA&#x92;s argument.  See Reply Brief 16&#x96;17.  The contention, however, is inconsistent with Teachers v. Hudson,

.  There, we rejected the union&#x92;s position that &#x93;because a 100% escrow completely avoids the risk that dissenters&#x92; contributions could be used improperly, it eliminates any valid constitutional objection to the procedure and thereby provides an adequate remedy.&#x94;  Id., at 309.  We held that even if the entire agency fee remained in escrow throughout arbitration, objectors (who are deprived of the use of what maybe their property pending the outcome of the dispute) had an independent, enforceable interest in the prompt and proper resolution of their objections.

				An &#x93;agency shop&#x94; arrangement permits a union, obliged to act on behalf of all employees in the bargaining unit, to charge nonunion workers their fair share of the costs of the representation.  The purposes for which a union may spend the &#x93;agency fee&#x94; paid by nonmembers, however, are circumscribed by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> (when public employers are involved) and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) or Railway Labor Act (RLA) (when private employers subject to their provisions are involved).  In

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> requires public-employee unions to accord workers who object to the agency fee &#x93;a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decisionmaker.&#x94;

				Petitioner Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA or Union), a private-sector labor organization covered by the RLA, acknowledges that it is bound by 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.  ALPA endeavored to comply with 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;impartial decisionmaker&#x94; requirement by referring all fee disputes to a neutral arbitrator.  In the action now before us, nonunion pilots challenged the agency fee collected by the Union in 1992.  ALPA urged that the challengers must exhaust the arbitration process before pursuing judicial remedies.  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the pilots resisting the agency fee may proceed at once in federal court.  We hold, in accord with the Court of Appeals, that employees need not submit fee disputes to arbitration when they have never agreed to do so.

				ALPA represents, as exclusive bargaining agent, pilots employed by most United States commercial air carriers, including Delta Air Lines (Delta).  In November 1991, ALPA and Delta amended their collective-bargaining agreement to include, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, an &#x93;agency shop&#x94; clause.  That clause, similar to provisions in ALPA&#x92;s agreements with other carriers, required each pilot who was not an ALPA member to pay the Union a monthly &#x93;service charge as a contribution for the administration of [the collective- bargaining agreement] and the representation of such employee.&#x94;  App. 31.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				On December 12, 1991, five Delta pilots filed this action against ALPA and Delta in the District Court for the District of Columbia.  Their complaint charged that the &#x93;agency shop&#x94; clause was unlawful on its face.  (Three of the original plaintiffs, plus 150 Delta pilots who subsequently intervened, are respondents here; the other two original plaintiffs were dismissed from the case for reasons unrelated to the issue we resolve.  Delta was also dismissed from the case on grounds not pertinent here.)  The pilots unsuccessfully moved for a preliminary injunction against implementation of the agency shop arrangement, and ALPA began collecting agency fees on January 1, 1992.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1992, ALPA charged its members monthly dues of 2.35 percent of each pilot&#x92;s earnings.  The Union ultimately determined, in its final, audited &#x93;Statement of Germane and Nongermane Expenses&#x94; (SGNE) for 1992, that 19 percent of ALPA&#x92;s expenses for that year were not germane to collective bargaining.  Accordingly, the Union adjusted fees charged nonmembers to equal 81 percent of the amount members paid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On October 8, 1992, some months after the Union had begun to collect agency fees, the pilots moved to amend their complaint to add a count challenging the manner in which ALPA calculated the fee.  They alleged, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, that ALPA had overstated the percentage of its expenditures genuinely attributable to &#x93;germane&#x94; activities.  The District Court granted the motion to amend on August 2, 1993.  The pilots&#x92; original facial challenges to the agency-shop clause were later resolved in the Union&#x92;s favor on summary judgment (a matter the pilots did not contest on appeal).  Thus, the challenge to the 1992 agency fee calculation is the only claim before us.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Under ALPA&#x92;s &#x93;Policies and Procedures Applicable to Agency Fees,&#x94; pilots who object to the fee calculation may request arbitration under procedures the American Arbitration Association (AAA) devised to resolve such disputes.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 69&#x96;70.  One hundred seventy-four Delta pilots filed timely objections with the Union after receiving the 1992 SGNE.  ALPA treated those objections as requests for arbitration and referred them to the AAA.  On October 15, 1993, the AAA appointed an arbitrator to resolve the objections in a single, consolidated proceeding.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The objectors included 91 of the 153 pilots who are respondents here.  (The other 62 respondents intervened in the lawsuit but were not parties to the arbitration.)  Preferring to pursue their challenges to ALPA&#x92;s agency-fee calculation in the context of their ongoing federal-court action, the respondent-objectors asked the AAA to suspend the arbitration.  The AAA referred that request to the arbitrator, who declined to defer to the federal-court litigation.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 106.  After the District Court denied a motion to enjoin the arbitration, 
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 111&#x96;114, respondents&#x92; counsel entered a &#x93;conditional appearance&#x94; in the arbitral proceedings.  The arbitrator held hearings in January, February, and March 1994.  He ultimately sustained the Union&#x92;s agency fee calculation in substantial part, although he concluded that &#x93;nongermane&#x94; expenses made up 21.49 percent of the union&#x92;s budget, not 19 percent as the Union had determined.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a&#x96;115a, 158a&#x96;161a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After the arbitrator issued his decision, ALPA moved for summary judgment in the federal-court action.  Granting the motion, the District Court concluded that pilots seeking to challenge the Union&#x92;s agency-fee calculation must exhaust arbitral remedies before proceeding in court.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 26a&#x96;31a.  Accordingly, the court held, the 62 respondents who did not join the arbitration were bound by the arbitrator&#x92;s decision.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 32a.  The other 91 respondents, the District Court ruled, qualified for clear-error review of the arbitrator&#x92;s fact findings and 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 review of all legal issues.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 31a.  Determining that the arbitrator had committed no error of law or clear error of fact, the court sustained his decision.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  108 F. 3d 1415 (1997).  That court found &#x93;no legal basis&#x94; for requiring objectors to arbitrate agency-fee challenges unless they had agreed to do so (as respondents had not).  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 1421 (emphasis deleted).  It therefore concluded that &#x93;the arbitrator&#x92;s decision [was] no longer a part of the legal picture,&#x94; and for that reason the case &#x93;must be remanded.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 1422.  We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. ___ (1997), limited to the question whether an objector must exhaust a union-provided arbitration process before bringing an agency-fee challenge in federal court, a matter on which the Courts of Appeals have reached differing conclusions.

				Because Delta is a &#x93;common carrier by air engaged in interstate or foreign commerce,&#x94; 45  U. S. C. &#xA7;181, the RLA governs its bargaining relationship with ALPA.  Section 2, Eleventh, of the RLA allows employers and unions to conclude agency shop agreements.

				In his concurring opinion in

				The Union, it is true, acted to comply with this Court&#x92;s decision in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 rather than out of its own unconstrained choice.  But 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirement of &#x93;a reasonably prompt decision by an impartial decisionmaker,&#x94; 475 U. S., at 307, aims to protect the interest of objectors by affording them access to a neutral forum in which their objections can be resolved swiftly; nothing in our decision purports to compel objectors to pursue that remedy.  See 
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 307 (&#x93;The nonunion employee, whose 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights are affected by the agency shop itself and who bears the burden of objecting, is entitled to have his objections addressed in an expeditious, fair, and objective manner.&#x94;).  Indeed, 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s emphasis on the need for a speedy remedy weighs against exhaustion, even through an arbitration procedure intended to be expeditious, as an essential prerequisite to federal-court consideration of nonmember challenges.  See 
				<em>
					McCarthy
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;[A]dministrative remedies need not be pursued if the litigant&#x92;s interests in immediate judicial review outweigh the government&#x92;s interests in the efficiency or administrative autonomy that the exhaustion doctrine is designed to further.&#x94;) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We resist reading 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 in a manner that might frustrate its very purpose, to advance the swift, fair, and final settlement of objectors&#x92; rights.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Against these concerns, ALPA stresses the asserted efficiency gains of requiring objectors to proceed to arbitration first.  The Union asserts:  &#x93;It is difficult to conceive how a court could fairly try an agency-fee dispute 
				<em>
					ab initio
				</em>
				, given that the plaintiffs who challenge an agency-fee calculation are not required to state any grounds whatsoever for their challenge.&#x94;  Reply Brief 6&#x96;7.  Arbitration, in ALPA&#x92;s view, will serve a useful if not essential role in defining the scope of the dispute.  See Brief for Petitioner 21&#x96;23; Reply Brief 4&#x96;7.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				ALPA overstates the difficulties of holding a federal-court hearing without a preparatory arbitration.  We have held that &#x93;the nonunion employee has the burden of raising an objection, but that the union retains the burden of proof.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 475 U. S., at 306.  And when pursuing the union&#x92;s 
				<em>
					internal
				</em>
				 remedies, an objector may preserve the right to subsequent judicial relief without &#x93;indicat[ing] to the Union the 
				<em>
					specific
				</em>
				 expenditures to which he objects.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Abood
				</em>
				, 431 U. S., at 241 (emphasis in original).  In stating that the &#x93;nonmember&#x92;s &#x91;burden&#x92; is simply the obligation to make his objection known,&#x94; 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 475 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 306, n. 16, however, we did not hold that a federal-court plaintiff can file a generally phrased complaint, then sit back and require the union to prove the &#x93;germaneness&#x94; of its expenditures without a clue as to &#x93;which of its thousands of expenditures&#x94; the objectors oppose.  Reply Brief 4.  Agency fee challengers, like all other civil litigants, must make their objections known with the degree of specificity appropriate at each stage of litigation their case reaches:  motion to dismiss; motion for summary judgment; pretrial conference.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The very purpose of 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s notice requirement is to provide employees sufficient information to enable them to identify the expenditures that, in their view, the union has improperly classified as germane.  See 475 U. S., at 306&#x96;307.  With the 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 notice, plus any additional information developed through reasonable discovery, an objector can be expected to point to the expenditures or classes of expenditures he or she finds questionable.  Although the union must establish that those expenditures were in fact germane, the shifted burden of proof provides no warrant for blocking dissenting employees from bringing their claims in federal court in the first instance, if that is their preference.  The answer to ALPA&#x92;s efficiency concern lies in conscientious management of the pretrial process to guard against abuse, not in a judicially imposed exhaustion requirement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Moreover, the degree to which an exhaustion requirement would reduce the burden on the courts is uncertain.  To the extent that the arbitrator does not sustain an objection to the union&#x92;s fee calculation, exhaustion would require the objector to traverse two layers of procedure rather than one.

                </sup>
            </a>
				  Furthermore, if the union&#x92;s arbitration process in fact operates to provide an inexpensive, swift and sure remedy for agency-fee errors, dissenting employees may avail themselves of that process even if not required to do so.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Patsy
				</em>
				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">513</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">15</a> (1982)
 (under a &#x93; &#x91;free market&#x92; system&#x94; of no required exhaustion, &#x93;litigants are free to pursue administrative remedies if they truly appear to be cheaper, more efficient, and more effective&#x94;).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Union may, nonetheless, face the prospect of defending its fee calculation simultaneously in judicial and arbitral fora.  We note that unions do not lack means to limit the expense and disruption occasioned by multiple fee challenges:  objections may be consolidated for consideration in a single arbitration, for example, and agency-fee litigation may be consolidated in a single district court.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1404.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;1404</a>.  But genuine as the Union&#x92;s interest in avoiding multiple proceedings may be, that interest does not overwhelm objectors&#x92; resistance to arbitration to which they did not consent, and their election to proceed immediately to court for adjudication of their federal rights.

						 Amicus National Education Association (NEA) argues that the question before us is one not of exhaustion but of ripeness.  Illegality depends on the spending of compelled agency fees for ideological purposes, NEA maintains, not simply the initial collection of those fees; hence, an objector has no basis for filing suit until the arbitrator has ruled and the disputed amounts are released from escrow.  See Brief for National Education Association as Amicus Curiae 18&#x96;20.  Petitioner, in its reply brief, endorses NEA&#x92;s argument.  See Reply Brief 16&#x96;17.  The contention, however, is inconsistent with Teachers v. Hudson, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/475/292" class="subref" title="subref">475 U. S. 292</a> (1986)
.  There, we rejected the union&#x92;s position that &#x93;because a 100% escrow completely avoids the risk that dissenters&#x92; contributions could be used improperly, it eliminates any valid constitutional objection to the procedure and thereby provides an adequate remedy.&#x94;  Id., at 309.  We held that even if the entire agency fee remained in escrow throughout arbitration, objectors (who are deprived of the use of what maybe their property pending the outcome of the dispute) had an independent, enforceable interest in the prompt and proper resolution of their objections.

						 Inevitably limiting the utility of exhaustion in relieving the courts of the task of adjudicating agency-fee disputes is the nonbinding character of Hudson arbitration, a characteristic on which the dissent centrally relies.  See post, at 1, 2, 3, 4&#x96;5, 5&#x96;6.

				An &#x93;agency shop&#x94; arrangement permits a union, obliged to act on behalf of all employees in the bargaining unit, to charge nonunion workers their fair share of the costs of the representation.  The purposes for which a union may spend the &#x93;agency fee&#x94; paid by nonmembers, however, are circumscribed by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> (when public employers are involved) and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) or Railway Labor Act (RLA) (when private employers subject to their provisions are involved).  In

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> requires public-employee unions to accord workers who object to the agency fee &#x93;a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decisionmaker.&#x94;

				Petitioner Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA or Union), a private-sector labor organization covered by the RLA, acknowledges that it is bound by 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.  ALPA endeavored to comply with 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;impartial decisionmaker&#x94; requirement by referring all fee disputes to a neutral arbitrator.  In the action now before us, nonunion pilots challenged the agency fee collected by the Union in 1992.  ALPA urged that the challengers must exhaust the arbitration process before pursuing judicial remedies.  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the pilots resisting the agency fee may proceed at once in federal court.  We hold, in accord with the Court of Appeals, that employees need not submit fee disputes to arbitration when they have never agreed to do so.

				ALPA represents, as exclusive bargaining agent, pilots employed by most United States commercial air carriers, including Delta Air Lines (Delta).  In November 1991, ALPA and Delta amended their collective-bargaining agreement to include, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, an &#x93;agency shop&#x94; clause.  That clause, similar to provisions in ALPA&#x92;s agreements with other carriers, required each pilot who was not an ALPA member to pay the Union a monthly &#x93;service charge as a contribution for the administration of [the collective- bargaining agreement] and the representation of such employee.&#x94;  App. 31.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				On December 12, 1991, five Delta pilots filed this action against ALPA and Delta in the District Court for the District of Columbia.  Their complaint charged that the &#x93;agency shop&#x94; clause was unlawful on its face.  (Three of the original plaintiffs, plus 150 Delta pilots who subsequently intervened, are respondents here; the other two original plaintiffs were dismissed from the case for reasons unrelated to the issue we resolve.  Delta was also dismissed from the case on grounds not pertinent here.)  The pilots unsuccessfully moved for a preliminary injunction against implementation of the agency shop arrangement, and ALPA began collecting agency fees on January 1, 1992.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1992, ALPA charged its members monthly dues of 2.35 percent of each pilot&#x92;s earnings.  The Union ultimately determined, in its final, audited &#x93;Statement of Germane and Nongermane Expenses&#x94; (SGNE) for 1992, that 19 percent of ALPA&#x92;s expenses for that year were not germane to collective bargaining.  Accordingly, the Union adjusted fees charged nonmembers to equal 81 percent of the amount members paid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On October 8, 1992, some months after the Union had begun to collect agency fees, the pilots moved to amend their complaint to add a count challenging the manner in which ALPA calculated the fee.  They alleged, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, that ALPA had overstated the percentage of its expenditures genuinely attributable to &#x93;germane&#x94; activities.  The District Court granted the motion to amend on August 2, 1993.  The pilots&#x92; original facial challenges to the agency-shop clause were later resolved in the Union&#x92;s favor on summary judgment (a matter the pilots did not contest on appeal).  Thus, the challenge to the 1992 agency fee calculation is the only claim before us.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Under ALPA&#x92;s &#x93;Policies and Procedures Applicable to Agency Fees,&#x94; pilots who object to the fee calculation may request arbitration under procedures the American Arbitration Association (AAA) devised to resolve such disputes.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 69&#x96;70.  One hundred seventy-four Delta pilots filed timely objections with the Union after receiving the 1992 SGNE.  ALPA treated those objections as requests for arbitration and referred them to the AAA.  On October 15, 1993, the AAA appointed an arbitrator to resolve the objections in a single, consolidated proceeding.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The objectors included 91 of the 153 pilots who are respondents here.  (The other 62 respondents intervened in the lawsuit but were not parties to the arbitration.)  Preferring to pursue their challenges to ALPA&#x92;s agency-fee calculation in the context of their ongoing federal-court action, the respondent-objectors asked the AAA to suspend the arbitration.  The AAA referred that request to the arbitrator, who declined to defer to the federal-court litigation.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 106.  After the District Court denied a motion to enjoin the arbitration, 
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 111&#x96;114, respondents&#x92; counsel entered a &#x93;conditional appearance&#x94; in the arbitral proceedings.  The arbitrator held hearings in January, February, and March 1994.  He ultimately sustained the Union&#x92;s agency fee calculation in substantial part, although he concluded that &#x93;nongermane&#x94; expenses made up 21.49 percent of the union&#x92;s budget, not 19 percent as the Union had determined.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a&#x96;115a, 158a&#x96;161a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After the arbitrator issued his decision, ALPA moved for summary judgment in the federal-court action.  Granting the motion, the District Court concluded that pilots seeking to challenge the Union&#x92;s agency-fee calculation must exhaust arbitral remedies before proceeding in court.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 26a&#x96;31a.  Accordingly, the court held, the 62 respondents who did not join the arbitration were bound by the arbitrator&#x92;s decision.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 32a.  The other 91 respondents, the District Court ruled, qualified for clear-error review of the arbitrator&#x92;s fact findings and 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 review of all legal issues.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 31a.  Determining that the arbitrator had committed no error of law or clear error of fact, the court sustained his decision.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  108 F. 3d 1415 (1997).  That court found &#x93;no legal basis&#x94; for requiring objectors to arbitrate agency-fee challenges unless they had agreed to do so (as respondents had not).  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 1421 (emphasis deleted).  It therefore concluded that &#x93;the arbitrator&#x92;s decision [was] no longer a part of the legal picture,&#x94; and for that reason the case &#x93;must be remanded.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 1422.  We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. ___ (1997), limited to the question whether an objector must exhaust a union-provided arbitration process before bringing an agency-fee challenge in federal court, a matter on which the Courts of Appeals have reached differing conclusions.

				Because Delta is a &#x93;common carrier by air engaged in interstate or foreign commerce,&#x94; 45  U. S. C. &#xA7;181, the RLA governs its bargaining relationship with ALPA.  Section 2, Eleventh, of the RLA allows employers and unions to conclude agency shop agreements.

, we upheld the constitutionality of agency shop agreements made by government employers with their workers&#x92; exclusive bargaining representatives.  As the Court explained, imposition of agency fees under the RLA &#x93;is constitutionally justified by the legislative assessment of the important contribution of the union shop to the system of labor relations established by Congress,&#x94; and &#x93;[t]he same important government interests &#x2026; presumptively support&#x94; agency shop arrangements in the public sector.

				The Union, it is true, acted to comply with this Court&#x92;s decision in 
				<em>
					Hudson

				 rather than out of its own unconstrained choice.  But 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirement of &#x93;a reasonably prompt decision by an impartial decisionmaker,&#x94; 475 U. S., at 307, aims to protect the interest of objectors by affording them access to a neutral forum in which their objections can be resolved swiftly; nothing in our decision purports to compel objectors to pursue that remedy.  See 
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 307 (&#x93;The nonunion employee, whose 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights are affected by the agency shop itself and who bears the burden of objecting, is entitled to have his objections addressed in an expeditious, fair, and objective manner.&#x94;).  Indeed, 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s emphasis on the need for a speedy remedy weighs against exhaustion, even through an arbitration procedure intended to be expeditious, as an essential prerequisite to federal-court consideration of nonmember challenges.  See 
				<em>
					McCarthy
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;[A]dministrative remedies need not be pursued if the litigant&#x92;s interests in immediate judicial review outweigh the government&#x92;s interests in the efficiency or administrative autonomy that the exhaustion doctrine is designed to further.&#x94;) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We resist reading 
				<em>

				 in a manner that might frustrate its very purpose, to advance the swift, fair, and final settlement of objectors&#x92; rights.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Against these concerns, ALPA stresses the asserted efficiency gains of requiring objectors to proceed to arbitration first.  The Union asserts:  &#x93;It is difficult to conceive how a court could fairly try an agency-fee dispute

					ab initio
				</em>
				, given that the plaintiffs who challenge an agency-fee calculation are not required to state any grounds whatsoever for their challenge.&#x94;  Reply Brief 6&#x96;7.

				ALPA overstates the difficulties of holding a federal-court hearing without a preparatory arbitration.  We have held that &#x93;the nonunion employee has the burden of raising an objection, but that the union retains the burden of proof.&#x94;

				, 431 U. S., at 241 (emphasis in original).  In stating that the &#x93;nonmember&#x92;s &#x91;burden&#x92; is simply the obligation to make his objection known,&#x94;

				at 306, n. 16, however, we did not hold that a federal-court plaintiff can file a generally phrased complaint, then sit back and require the union to prove the &#x93;germaneness&#x94; of its expenditures without a clue as to &#x93;which of its thousands of expenditures&#x94; the objectors oppose.  Reply Brief 4.  Agency fee challengers, like all other civil litigants, must make their objections known with the degree of specificity appropriate at each stage of litigation their case reaches:  motion to dismiss; motion for summary judgment; pretrial conference.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The very purpose of 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s notice requirement is to provide employees sufficient information to enable them to identify the expenditures that, in their view, the union has improperly classified as germane.  See 475 U. S., at 306&#x96;307.  With the 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 notice, plus any additional information developed through reasonable discovery, an objector can be expected to point to the expenditures or classes of expenditures he or she finds questionable.  Although the union must establish that those expenditures were in fact germane, the shifted burden of proof provides no warrant for blocking dissenting employees from bringing their claims in federal court in the first instance, if that is their preference.  The answer to ALPA&#x92;s efficiency concern lies in conscientious management of the pretrial process to guard against abuse, not in a judicially imposed exhaustion requirement.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Moreover, the degree to which an exhaustion requirement would reduce the burden on the courts is uncertain.  To the extent that the arbitrator does not sustain an objection to the union&#x92;s fee calculation, exhaustion would require the objector to traverse two layers of procedure rather than one.

 (under a &#x93; &#x91;free market&#x92; system&#x94; of no required exhaustion, &#x93;litigants are free to pursue administrative remedies if they truly appear to be cheaper, more efficient, and more effective&#x94;).

				The Union may, nonetheless, face the prospect of defending its fee calculation simultaneously in judicial and arbitral fora.  We note that unions do not lack means to limit the expense and disruption occasioned by multiple fee challenges:  objections may be consolidated for consideration in a single arbitration, for example, and agency-fee litigation may be consolidated in a single district court.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1404.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;1404</a>.  But genuine as the Union&#x92;s interest in avoiding multiple proceedings may be, that interest does not overwhelm objectors&#x92; resistance to arbitration to which they did not consent, and their election to proceed immediately to court for adjudication of their federal rights.

						 Amicus National Education Association (NEA) argues that the question before us is one not of exhaustion but of ripeness.  Illegality depends on the spending of compelled agency fees for ideological purposes, NEA maintains, not simply the initial collection of those fees; hence, an objector has no basis for filing suit until the arbitrator has ruled and the disputed amounts are released from escrow.  See Brief for National Education Association as Amicus Curiae 18&#x96;20.  Petitioner, in its reply brief, endorses NEA&#x92;s argument.  See Reply Brief 16&#x96;17.  The contention, however, is inconsistent with Teachers v. Hudson,

.  There, we rejected the union&#x92;s position that &#x93;because a 100% escrow completely avoids the risk that dissenters&#x92; contributions could be used improperly, it eliminates any valid constitutional objection to the procedure and thereby provides an adequate remedy.&#x94;  Id., at 309.  We held that even if the entire agency fee remained in escrow throughout arbitration, objectors (who are deprived of the use of what maybe their property pending the outcome of the dispute) had an independent, enforceable interest in the prompt and proper resolution of their objections.

				An &#x93;agency shop&#x94; arrangement permits a union, obliged to act on behalf of all employees in the bargaining unit, to charge nonunion workers their fair share of the costs of the representation.  The purposes for which a union may spend the &#x93;agency fee&#x94; paid by nonmembers, however, are circumscribed by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> (when public employers are involved) and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) or Railway Labor Act (RLA) (when private employers subject to their provisions are involved).  In

, we held that the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> requires public-employee unions to accord workers who object to the agency fee &#x93;a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decisionmaker.&#x94;

				Petitioner Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA or Union), a private-sector labor organization covered by the RLA, acknowledges that it is bound by 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.  ALPA endeavored to comply with 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;impartial decisionmaker&#x94; requirement by referring all fee disputes to a neutral arbitrator.  In the action now before us, nonunion pilots challenged the agency fee collected by the Union in 1992.  ALPA urged that the challengers must exhaust the arbitration process before pursuing judicial remedies.  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the pilots resisting the agency fee may proceed at once in federal court.  We hold, in accord with the Court of Appeals, that employees need not submit fee disputes to arbitration when they have never agreed to do so.

				ALPA represents, as exclusive bargaining agent, pilots employed by most United States commercial air carriers, including Delta Air Lines (Delta).  In November 1991, ALPA and Delta amended their collective-bargaining agreement to include, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, an &#x93;agency shop&#x94; clause.  That clause, similar to provisions in ALPA&#x92;s agreements with other carriers, required each pilot who was not an ALPA member to pay the Union a monthly &#x93;service charge as a contribution for the administration of [the collective- bargaining agreement] and the representation of such employee.&#x94;  App. 31.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				On December 12, 1991, five Delta pilots filed this action against ALPA and Delta in the District Court for the District of Columbia.  Their complaint charged that the &#x93;agency shop&#x94; clause was unlawful on its face.  (Three of the original plaintiffs, plus 150 Delta pilots who subsequently intervened, are respondents here; the other two original plaintiffs were dismissed from the case for reasons unrelated to the issue we resolve.  Delta was also dismissed from the case on grounds not pertinent here.)  The pilots unsuccessfully moved for a preliminary injunction against implementation of the agency shop arrangement, and ALPA began collecting agency fees on January 1, 1992.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1992, ALPA charged its members monthly dues of 2.35 percent of each pilot&#x92;s earnings.  The Union ultimately determined, in its final, audited &#x93;Statement of Germane and Nongermane Expenses&#x94; (SGNE) for 1992, that 19 percent of ALPA&#x92;s expenses for that year were not germane to collective bargaining.  Accordingly, the Union adjusted fees charged nonmembers to equal 81 percent of the amount members paid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On October 8, 1992, some months after the Union had begun to collect agency fees, the pilots moved to amend their complaint to add a count challenging the manner in which ALPA calculated the fee.  They alleged, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, that ALPA had overstated the percentage of its expenditures genuinely attributable to &#x93;germane&#x94; activities.  The District Court granted the motion to amend on August 2, 1993.  The pilots&#x92; original facial challenges to the agency-shop clause were later resolved in the Union&#x92;s favor on summary judgment (a matter the pilots did not contest on appeal).  Thus, the challenge to the 1992 agency fee calculation is the only claim before us.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Under ALPA&#x92;s &#x93;Policies and Procedures Applicable to Agency Fees,&#x94; pilots who object to the fee calculation may request arbitration under procedures the American Arbitration Association (AAA) devised to resolve such disputes.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 69&#x96;70.  One hundred seventy-four Delta pilots filed timely objections with the Union after receiving the 1992 SGNE.  ALPA treated those objections as requests for arbitration and referred them to the AAA.  On October 15, 1993, the AAA appointed an arbitrator to resolve the objections in a single, consolidated proceeding.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The objectors included 91 of the 153 pilots who are respondents here.  (The other 62 respondents intervened in the lawsuit but were not parties to the arbitration.)  Preferring to pursue their challenges to ALPA&#x92;s agency-fee calculation in the context of their ongoing federal-court action, the respondent-objectors asked the AAA to suspend the arbitration.  The AAA referred that request to the arbitrator, who declined to defer to the federal-court litigation.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 106.  After the District Court denied a motion to enjoin the arbitration, 
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 111&#x96;114, respondents&#x92; counsel entered a &#x93;conditional appearance&#x94; in the arbitral proceedings.  The arbitrator held hearings in January, February, and March 1994.  He ultimately sustained the Union&#x92;s agency fee calculation in substantial part, although he concluded that &#x93;nongermane&#x94; expenses made up 21.49 percent of the union&#x92;s budget, not 19 percent as the Union had determined.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a&#x96;115a, 158a&#x96;161a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After the arbitrator issued his decision, ALPA moved for summary judgment in the federal-court action.  Granting the motion, the District Court concluded that pilots seeking to challenge the Union&#x92;s agency-fee calculation must exhaust arbitral remedies before proceeding in court.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 26a&#x96;31a.  Accordingly, the court held, the 62 respondents who did not join the arbitration were bound by the arbitrator&#x92;s decision.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 32a.  The other 91 respondents, the District Court ruled, qualified for clear-error review of the arbitrator&#x92;s fact findings and 
				<em>
					de novo
				</em>
				 review of all legal issues.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 31a.  Determining that the arbitrator had committed no error of law or clear error of fact, the court sustained his decision.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  108 F. 3d 1415 (1997).  That court found &#x93;no legal basis&#x94; for requiring objectors to arbitrate agency-fee challenges unless they had agreed to do so (as respondents had not).  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 1421 (emphasis deleted).  It therefore concluded that &#x93;the arbitrator&#x92;s decision [was] no longer a part of the legal picture,&#x94; and for that reason the case &#x93;must be remanded.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 1422.  We granted certiorari, 522 U. S. ___ (1997), limited to the question whether an objector must exhaust a union-provided arbitration process before bringing an agency-fee challenge in federal court, a matter on which the Courts of Appeals have reached differing conclusions.

				Because Delta is a &#x93;common carrier by air engaged in interstate or foreign commerce,&#x94; 45  U. S. C. &#xA7;181, the RLA governs its bargaining relationship with ALPA.  Section 2, Eleventh, of the RLA allows employers and unions to conclude agency shop agreements.

, we upheld the constitutionality of agency shop agreements made by government employers with their workers&#x92; exclusive bargaining representatives.  As the Court explained, imposition of agency fees under the RLA &#x93;is constitutionally justified by the legislative assessment of the important contribution of the union shop to the system of labor relations established by Congress,&#x94; and &#x93;[t]he same important government interests &#x2026; presumptively support&#x94; agency shop arrangements in the public sector.

				  We therefore turn directly to the question presented:  When a union adopts an arbitration process to comply with 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;impartial decisionmaker&#x94; requirement, must agency-fee objectors pursue and exhaust the arbitral remedy before challenging the union&#x92;s calculation in a federal-court action?

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In his concurring opinion in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, Justice White (joined by Chief Justice Burger) answered that question &#x93;yes.&#x94;  He stated: &#x93;[I]f the union provides for arbitration and complies with the other requirements specified in our opinion, it should be entitled to insist that the arbitration procedure be exhausted before resorting to the courts.&#x94;  475 U. S., at 311 (concurring opinion).  The Court&#x92;s opinion did not comment on that unelaborated assertion, however, so the issue remains live for the decision we now reach.  The Court of Appeals recognized that &#x93;Justice White raised a legitimate 
				<em>
					practical
				</em>
				 concern,&#x94; but found &#x93;no 
				<em>
					legal
				</em>
				 basis for forcing into arbitration a party who never agreed to put his dispute over federal law to such a process.&#x94;  108 F. 3d, at 1421 (emphasis in original).  We agree, and decline to read 
				<em>

				The Union, it is true, acted to comply with this Court&#x92;s decision in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 rather than out of its own unconstrained choice.  But 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirement of &#x93;a reasonably prompt decision by an impartial decisionmaker,&#x94; 475 U. S., at 307, aims to protect the interest of objectors by affording them access to a neutral forum in which their objections can be resolved swiftly; nothing in our decision purports to compel objectors to pursue that remedy.  See 
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 307 (&#x93;The nonunion employee, whose 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights are affected by the agency shop itself and who bears the burden of objecting, is entitled to have his objections addressed in an expeditious, fair, and objective manner.&#x94;).  Indeed, 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s emphasis on the need for a speedy remedy weighs against exhaustion, even through an arbitration procedure intended to be expeditious, as an essential prerequisite to federal-court consideration of nonmember challenges.  See 
				<em>
					McCarthy
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;[A]dministrative remedies need not be pursued if the litigant&#x92;s interests in immediate judicial review outweigh the government&#x92;s interests in the efficiency or administrative autonomy that the exhaustion doctrine is designed to further.&#x94;) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We resist reading 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 in a manner that might frustrate its very purpose, to advance the swift, fair, and final settlement of objectors&#x92; rights.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Against these concerns, ALPA stresses the asserted efficiency gains of requiring objectors to proceed to arbitration first.  The Union asserts:  &#x93;It is difficult to conceive how a court could fairly try an agency-fee dispute 
				<em>
					ab initio
				</em>
				, given that the plaintiffs who challenge an agency-fee calculation are not required to state any grounds whatsoever for their challenge.&#x94;  Reply Brief 6&#x96;7.

				ALPA overstates the difficulties of holding a federal-court hearing without a preparatory arbitration.  We have held that &#x93;the nonunion employee has the burden of raising an objection, but that the union retains the burden of proof.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 475 U. S., at 306.  And when pursuing the union&#x92;s 
				<em>

				<em>
					specific
				</em>
				 expenditures to which he objects.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Abood
				</em>
				, 431 U. S., at 241 (emphasis in original).  In stating that the &#x93;nonmember&#x92;s &#x91;burden&#x92; is simply the obligation to make his objection known,&#x94; 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 475 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 306, n. 16, however, we did not hold that a federal-court plaintiff can file a generally phrased complaint, then sit back and require the union to prove the &#x93;germaneness&#x94; of its expenditures without a clue as to &#x93;which of its thousands of expenditures&#x94; the objectors oppose.  Reply Brief 4.  Agency fee challengers, like all other civil litigants, must make their objections known with the degree of specificity appropriate at each stage of litigation their case reaches:  motion to dismiss; motion for summary judgment; pretrial conference.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The very purpose of 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s notice requirement is to provide employees sufficient information to enable them to identify the expenditures that, in their view, the union has improperly classified as germane.  See 475 U. S., at 306&#x96;307.  With the 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 notice, plus any additional information developed through reasonable discovery, an objector can be expected to point to the expenditures or classes of expenditures he or she finds questionable.  Although the union must establish that those expenditures were in fact germane, the shifted burden of proof provides no warrant for blocking dissenting employees from bringing their claims in federal court in the first instance, if that is their preference.  The answer to ALPA&#x92;s efficiency concern lies in conscientious management of the pretrial process to guard against abuse, not in a judicially imposed exhaustion requirement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Moreover, the degree to which an exhaustion requirement would reduce the burden on the courts is uncertain.  To the extent that the arbitrator does not sustain an objection to the union&#x92;s fee calculation, exhaustion would require the objector to traverse two layers of procedure rather than one.

            </a>
				  Furthermore, if the union&#x92;s arbitration process in fact operates to provide an inexpensive, swift and sure remedy for agency-fee errors, dissenting employees may avail themselves of that process even if not required to do so.  Cf. 
				<em>

 (under a &#x93; &#x91;free market&#x92; system&#x94; of no required exhaustion, &#x93;litigants are free to pursue administrative remedies if they truly appear to be cheaper, more efficient, and more effective&#x94;).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Union may, nonetheless, face the prospect of defending its fee calculation simultaneously in judicial and arbitral fora.  We note that unions do not lack means to limit the expense and disruption occasioned by multiple fee challenges:  objections may be consolidated for consideration in a single arbitration, for example, and agency-fee litigation may be consolidated in a single district court.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1404.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;1404</a>.  But genuine as the Union&#x92;s interest in avoiding multiple proceedings may be, that interest does not overwhelm objectors&#x92; resistance to arbitration to which they did not consent, and their election to proceed immediately to court for adjudication of their federal rights.

						 Amicus National Education Association (NEA) argues that the question before us is one not of exhaustion but of ripeness.  Illegality depends on the spending of compelled agency fees for ideological purposes, NEA maintains, not simply the initial collection of those fees; hence, an objector has no basis for filing suit until the arbitrator has ruled and the disputed amounts are released from escrow.  See Brief for National Education Association as Amicus Curiae 18&#x96;20.  Petitioner, in its reply brief, endorses NEA&#x92;s argument.  See Reply Brief 16&#x96;17.  The contention, however, is inconsistent with Teachers v. Hudson,

.  There, we rejected the union&#x92;s position that &#x93;because a 100% escrow completely avoids the risk that dissenters&#x92; contributions could be used improperly, it eliminates any valid constitutional objection to the procedure and thereby provides an adequate remedy.&#x94;  Id., at 309.  We held that even if the entire agency fee remained in escrow throughout arbitration, objectors (who are deprived of the use of what maybe their property pending the outcome of the dispute) had an independent, enforceable interest in the prompt and proper resolution of their objections.

				An &#x93;agency shop&#x94; arrangement permits a union, obliged to act on behalf of all employees in the bargaining unit, to charge nonunion workers their fair share of the costs of the representation.  The purposes for which a union may spend the &#x93;agency fee&#x94; paid by nonmembers, however, are circumscribed by the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> (when public employers are involved) and the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) or Railway Labor Act (RLA) (when private employers subject to their provisions are involved).  In

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> requires public-employee unions to accord workers who object to the agency fee &#x93;a reasonably prompt opportunity to challenge the amount of the fee before an impartial decisionmaker.&#x94;

				Petitioner Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA or Union), a private-sector labor organization covered by the RLA, acknowledges that it is bound by 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.  ALPA endeavored to comply with 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s &#x93;impartial decisionmaker&#x94; requirement by referring all fee disputes to a neutral arbitrator.  In the action now before us, nonunion pilots challenged the agency fee collected by the Union in 1992.  ALPA urged that the challengers must exhaust the arbitration process before pursuing judicial remedies.  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit held that the pilots resisting the agency fee may proceed at once in federal court.  We hold, in accord with the Court of Appeals, that employees need not submit fee disputes to arbitration when they have never agreed to do so.

				ALPA represents, as exclusive bargaining agent, pilots employed by most United States commercial air carriers, including Delta Air Lines (Delta).  In November 1991, ALPA and Delta amended their collective-bargaining agreement to include, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, an &#x93;agency shop&#x94; clause.  That clause, similar to provisions in ALPA&#x92;s agreements with other carriers, required each pilot who was not an ALPA member to pay the Union a monthly &#x93;service charge as a contribution for the administration of [the collective- bargaining agreement] and the representation of such employee.&#x94;  App. 31.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				On December 12, 1991, five Delta pilots filed this action against ALPA and Delta in the District Court for the District of Columbia.  Their complaint charged that the &#x93;agency shop&#x94; clause was unlawful on its face.  (Three of the original plaintiffs, plus 150 Delta pilots who subsequently intervened, are respondents here; the other two original plaintiffs were dismissed from the case for reasons unrelated to the issue we resolve.  Delta was also dismissed from the case on grounds not pertinent here.)  The pilots unsuccessfully moved for a preliminary injunction against implementation of the agency shop arrangement, and ALPA began collecting agency fees on January 1, 1992.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In 1992, ALPA charged its members monthly dues of 2.35 percent of each pilot&#x92;s earnings.  The Union ultimately determined, in its final, audited &#x93;Statement of Germane and Nongermane Expenses&#x94; (SGNE) for 1992, that 19 percent of ALPA&#x92;s expenses for that year were not germane to collective bargaining.  Accordingly, the Union adjusted fees charged nonmembers to equal 81 percent of the amount members paid.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				On October 8, 1992, some months after the Union had begun to collect agency fees, the pilots moved to amend their complaint to add a count challenging the manner in which ALPA calculated the fee.  They alleged, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, that ALPA had overstated the percentage of its expenditures genuinely attributable to &#x93;germane&#x94; activities.  The District Court granted the motion to amend on August 2, 1993.  The pilots&#x92; original facial challenges to the agency-shop clause were later resolved in the Union&#x92;s favor on summary judgment (a matter the pilots did not contest on appeal).  Thus, the challenge to the 1992 agency fee calculation is the only claim before us.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Under ALPA&#x92;s &#x93;Policies and Procedures Applicable to Agency Fees,&#x94; pilots who object to the fee calculation may request arbitration under procedures the American Arbitration Association (AAA) devised to resolve such disputes.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 69&#x96;70.  One hundred seventy-four Delta pilots filed timely objections with the Union after receiving the 1992 SGNE.  ALPA treated those objections as requests for arbitration and referred them to the AAA.  On October 15, 1993, the AAA appointed an arbitrator to resolve the objections in a single, consolidated proceeding.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The objectors included 91 of the 153 pilots who are respondents here.  (The other 62 respondents intervened in the lawsuit but were not parties to the arbitration.)  Preferring to pursue their challenges to ALPA&#x92;s agency-fee calculation in the context of their ongoing federal-court action, the respondent-objectors asked the AAA to suspend the arbitration.  The AAA referred that request to the arbitrator, who declined to defer to the federal-court litigation.  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 106.  After the District Court denied a motion to enjoin the arbitration, 
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 111&#x96;114, respondents&#x92; counsel entered a &#x93;conditional appearance&#x94; in the arbitral proceedings.  The arbitrator held hearings in January, February, and March 1994.  He ultimately sustained the Union&#x92;s agency fee calculation in substantial part, although he concluded that &#x93;nongermane&#x94; expenses made up 21.49 percent of the union&#x92;s budget, not 19 percent as the Union had determined.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 71a&#x96;115a, 158a&#x96;161a.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				After the arbitrator issued his decision, ALPA moved for summary judgment in the federal-court action.  Granting the motion, the District Court concluded that pilots seeking to challenge the Union&#x92;s agency-fee calculation must exhaust arbitral remedies before proceeding in court.

				The Union, it is true, acted to comply with this Court&#x92;s decision in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 rather than out of its own unconstrained choice.  But 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirement of &#x93;a reasonably prompt decision by an impartial decisionmaker,&#x94; 475 U. S., at 307, aims to protect the interest of objectors by affording them access to a neutral forum in which their objections can be resolved swiftly; nothing in our decision purports to compel objectors to pursue that remedy.  See 
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 307 (&#x93;The nonunion employee, whose 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a> rights are affected by the agency shop itself and who bears the burden of objecting, is entitled to have his objections addressed in an expeditious, fair, and objective manner.&#x94;).  Indeed, 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s emphasis on the need for a speedy remedy weighs against exhaustion, even through an arbitration procedure intended to be expeditious, as an essential prerequisite to federal-court consideration of nonmember challenges.  See 
				<em>
					McCarthy
				</em>
				, 503 U. S., at 146 (&#x93;[A]dministrative remedies need not be pursued if the litigant&#x92;s interests in immediate judicial review outweigh the government&#x92;s interests in the efficiency or administrative autonomy that the exhaustion doctrine is designed to further.&#x94;) (internal quotation marks omitted).  We resist reading 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 in a manner that might frustrate its very purpose, to advance the swift, fair, and final settlement of objectors&#x92; rights.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Against these concerns, ALPA stresses the asserted efficiency gains of requiring objectors to proceed to arbitration first.  The Union asserts:  &#x93;It is difficult to conceive how a court could fairly try an agency-fee dispute 
				<em>
					ab initio
				</em>
				, given that the plaintiffs who challenge an agency-fee calculation are not required to state any grounds whatsoever for their challenge.&#x94;  Reply Brief 6&#x96;7.

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				ALPA overstates the difficulties of holding a federal-court hearing without a preparatory arbitration.  We have held that &#x93;the nonunion employee has the burden of raising an objection, but that the union retains the burden of proof.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 475 U. S., at 306.  And when pursuing the union&#x92;s 
				<em>

				</em>
				 remedies, an objector may preserve the right to subsequent judicial relief without &#x93;indicat[ing] to the Union the 
				<em>
					specific
				</em>
				 expenditures to which he objects.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Abood
				</em>
				, 431 U. S., at 241 (emphasis in original).  In stating that the &#x93;nonmember&#x92;s &#x91;burden&#x92; is simply the obligation to make his objection known,&#x94; 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 475 U. S.,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				at 306, n. 16, however, we did not hold that a federal-court plaintiff can file a generally phrased complaint, then sit back and require the union to prove the &#x93;germaneness&#x94; of its expenditures without a clue as to &#x93;which of its thousands of expenditures&#x94; the objectors oppose.  Reply Brief 4.  Agency fee challengers, like all other civil litigants, must make their objections known with the degree of specificity appropriate at each stage of litigation their case reaches:  motion to dismiss; motion for summary judgment; pretrial conference.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The very purpose of 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s notice requirement is to provide employees sufficient information to enable them to identify the expenditures that, in their view, the union has improperly classified as germane.  See 475 U. S., at 306&#x96;307.  With the 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 notice, plus any additional information developed through reasonable discovery, an objector can be expected to point to the expenditures or classes of expenditures he or she finds questionable.  Although the union must establish that those expenditures were in fact germane, the shifted burden of proof provides no warrant for blocking dissenting employees from bringing their claims in federal court in the first instance, if that is their preference.  The answer to ALPA&#x92;s efficiency concern lies in conscientious management of the pretrial process to guard against abuse, not in a judicially imposed exhaustion requirement.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Moreover, the degree to which an exhaustion requirement would reduce the burden on the courts is uncertain.  To the extent that the arbitrator does not sustain an objection to the union&#x92;s fee calculation, exhaustion would require the objector to traverse two layers of procedure rather than one.

            </a>
				  Furthermore, if the union&#x92;s arbitration process in fact operates to provide an inexpensive, swift and sure remedy for agency-fee errors, dissenting employees may avail themselves of that process even if not required to do so.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Patsy
				</em>
				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">15</a> (1982)
 (under a &#x93; &#x91;free market&#x92; system&#x94; of no required exhaustion, &#x93;litigants are free to pursue administrative remedies if they truly appear to be cheaper, more efficient, and more effective&#x94;).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Union may, nonetheless, face the prospect of defending its fee calculation simultaneously in judicial and arbitral fora.  We note that unions do not lack means to limit the expense and disruption occasioned by multiple fee challenges:  objections may be consolidated for consideration in a single arbitration, for example, and agency-fee litigation may be consolidated in a single district court.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1404.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;1404</a>.  But genuine as the Union&#x92;s interest in avoiding multiple proceedings may be, that interest does not overwhelm objectors&#x92; resistance to arbitration to which they did not consent, and their election to proceed immediately to court for adjudication of their federal rights.

						 Amicus National Education Association (NEA) argues that the question before us is one not of exhaustion but of ripeness.  Illegality depends on the spending of compelled agency fees for ideological purposes, NEA maintains, not simply the initial collection of those fees; hence, an objector has no basis for filing suit until the arbitrator has ruled and the disputed amounts are released from escrow.  See Brief for National Education Association as Amicus Curiae 18&#x96;20.  Petitioner, in its reply brief, endorses NEA&#x92;s argument.  See Reply Brief 16&#x96;17.

We held that even if the entire agency fee remained in escrow throughout arbitration, objectors (who are deprived of the use of what maybe their property pending the outcome of the dispute) had an independent, enforceable interest in the prompt and proper resolution of their objections.

				First, consider the matter from the Union&#x92;s perspective.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; requirement seems reasonable because it lowers the costs of resolving agency fee disputes and makes their resolution manageable.  As this case illustrates, different groups of nonmember dissenters with different motivations for objecting may proceed in different forums.  Without the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule, they might do so simultaneously.  Judge and arbitrator, perhaps subject to different discovery requests, obtaining somewhat different information, hearing different arguments, operating under different rules of procedure and evidence, and exercising different judgments (each without knowledge of the other), could well determine differently costs and complex expenditure relationships, thereby reaching different, even conflicting, conclusions.

				<em>

				 AFL&#x96;CIO adds that the &#x93;costs of defending such litigation&#x94; (which may involve no more than $50 or so for any individual dissenter, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 10) &#x93;can easily consume the union&#x92;s agency fee receipts.&#x94;  Brief for AFL&#x96;CIO as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 14, n. 5.  The Court itself recognizes as &#x93;[g]enuine&#x94; the Union&#x92;s &#x93;concern&#x94; about defending &#x93;its fee calculation simultaneously in judicial and arbitral fora.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, consider the matter from the perspective of the dissenting employee.  The Court&#x92;s decision, rejecting the Union&#x92;s rule, may help to protect the ideological interests of a few of those employees, but only a few, and then in a way that does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 offset the corresponding harm caused the Union.  That is because &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; does not mean serious delay, for the arbitration must begin promptly and proceed expeditiously. See 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 307.  Moreover, nonbinding arbitration may resolve the dispute to the satisfaction of some dissenting employees, perhaps those whose objections rest less upon ideology and more upon a desire to minimize the fee they must pay.  See 
				<em>
					Gilpin
				</em>
				 v.
				<em>
					 AFSCME
				</em>
				, 875 F. 2d 1310, 1313 (CA7 1989) (noting that many objectors are &#x93;free riders&#x94; seeking representation at the lowest cost possible); 
				<em>
					Weaver

				<em>
					Univ. of Cincinnati

				</em>
				 v.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nor will trying arbitration first prejudice the cause of the remaining unsatisfied objectors.  The nonbinding arbitration process may deprive objectors of their money for a brief additional time, but the disputed fees must remain unspent in escrow during the arbitration proceedings.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 305, 310.  Nonbinding arbitration also leaves the objectors free to press their claims in a later court action&#x97;if the arbitration&#x92;s result leaves them dissatisfied.  And, as the Union conceded at oral argument, the judge in that later action, though informed by the arbitrator&#x92;s decision, would not accord it any special legal weight.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 16, 20&#x96;21; see also 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				,
				<span class="softbreak"/>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 308, n. 21 (&#x93;arbitrator&#x92;s decision would not receive preclusive effect in any subsequent &#xA7;1983 action&#x94;).  Cf. 
				<em>
					Skidmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">140</a> (1944)
 (administrative agency, through its interpretations, may have the &#x93;power to persuade, if lacking power to control&#x94;).  In other words, the objecting dissenter, though briefly delayed, could proceed in court and on a clean slate.  See Hensler, Court-Ordered Arbitration:  An Alternative View, U. Chi. Legal Forum 399, 401 (1990) (describing differences between mandatory 
				<em>
					non
				</em>
				-binding arbitration over agency fee calculations, and traditional mandatory 
				<em>
					binding
				</em>
				 arbitration).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				From the courts&#x92; perspective too, nonbinding arbitration can prove helpful.  Insofar as it settles matters to the parties&#x92; satisfaction, it avoids unnecessary, perhaps time-consuming, judicial investigation of highly complex union accounts and expense allocations.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Allen
				</em>
				, 373 U. S., at 122 (describing difficulties surrounding &#x93;judicially administered relief&#x94; for agency fee objectors, as compared with &#x93;internal union remedy&#x94;); 
				<em>
					Abood
				</em>
				, 431 U. S., at 240 (same).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The upshot is that the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule &#x93;prevent[s] compulsory subsidization of ideological activity&#x94; without unduly &#x93;restricting the Union&#x92;s ability&#x94; to collect a legitimate agency fee.  Consequently, neither the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>, nor any statute, as interpreted by this Court, prohibits the Union&#x92;s insistence upon that rule.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I fear that the majority is led to a different conclusion through use of analogies that, in my view, do not govern the circumstances before us.  First, the Court analogizes the arbitration at issue here to binding arbitration often found in contracts, including labor contracts, where arbitration is legally anchored in the consent of the parties.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 9.   But &#x93;consent&#x94; is not relevant to the legal justification for the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule before us.  Rather, that rule finds its legal anchor in the Union&#x92;s legal authority (indeed, obligation) under 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 to impose internal procedures that permit collection of agency fees, without undue infringement of objectors&#x92; constitutional rights.  I have explained above why the rule at issue here satisfies 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements.  If one needs an analogy, I would find it, not in consensual arbitration, but in court rules that require parties to try nonbinding arbitration before they pursue a case in court.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/651-658.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;651&#x96;658</a> (authorizing district courts to refer certain types of civil actions to arbitration); ADR Local Rules 2&#x96;3, 4&#x96;2 (ND Cal. 1998); see also Federal Judicial Center, Court-Annexed Arbitration in Ten District Courts (1990).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the Court describes the Union&#x92;s proposed &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule as an &#x93;extension of the discretionary exhaustion-of-remedies doctrine.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8&#x96;9.  But whether that particular doctrine offers legal justification in this case is beside the point.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule amounts to an elaboration of the obligations set forth in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.  Those obligations rested upon the substantive law that permits collection of agency fees interpreted in light of the competing demands of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 decided that this law required the courts to craft a mandatory, nonbinding mechanism for speedy dispute resolution.  Exhaustion principles did not prevent the Court from doing so.  Why then should those principles prevent the Court from elaborating upon 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements, by permitting a union to impose a reasonable &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule of the kind before us?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I note one additional matter.  The Court&#x92;s opinion refers to the &#x93;pilots &#x2026; proceed[ing] at once in federal court.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  The Court does not decide, however, whether a federal court can await the conclusion of an expeditious arbitration before it proceeds, for example, with discovery.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12&#x96;13, n. 6.  Should it await arbitration&#x92;s conclusion, the court would be able to take advantage of any settlement or narrowing of issues that the nonmandatory arbitration proceeding produced.  Doing so would alleviate many of the concerns that I have expressed in this opinion.  See
				<em>
					 supra
				</em>
				, at 3&#x96;5.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even so, the question before us is whether the Union can insist upon prior recourse to that form of arbitration.  For the reasons stated, I believe such a requirement is consistent with, and a reasonable extension of, this Court&#x92;s decision in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.

				First, consider the matter from the Union&#x92;s perspective.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; requirement seems reasonable because it lowers the costs of resolving agency fee disputes and makes their resolution manageable.  As this case illustrates, different groups of nonmember dissenters with different motivations for objecting may proceed in different forums.  Without the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule, they might do so simultaneously.  Judge and arbitrator, perhaps subject to different discovery requests, obtaining somewhat different information, hearing different arguments, operating under different rules of procedure and evidence, and exercising different judgments (each without knowledge of the other), could well determine differently costs and complex expenditure relationships, thereby reaching different, even conflicting, conclusions.

				Second, consider the matter from the perspective of the dissenting employee.  The Court&#x92;s decision, rejecting the Union&#x92;s rule, may help to protect the ideological interests of a few of those employees, but only a few, and then in a way that does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 offset the corresponding harm caused the Union.  That is because &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; does not mean serious delay, for the arbitration must begin promptly and proceed expeditiously. See 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 307.  Moreover, nonbinding arbitration may resolve the dispute to the satisfaction of some dissenting employees, perhaps those whose objections rest less upon ideology and more upon a desire to minimize the fee they must pay.  See 
				<em>
					Gilpin
				</em>
				 v.
				<em>
					 AFSCME
				</em>
				, 875 F. 2d 1310, 1313 (CA7 1989) (noting that many objectors are &#x93;free riders&#x94; seeking representation at the lowest cost possible);

				Nor will trying arbitration first prejudice the cause of the remaining unsatisfied objectors.  The nonbinding arbitration process may deprive objectors of their money for a brief additional time, but the disputed fees must remain unspent in escrow during the arbitration proceedings.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 305, 310.  Nonbinding arbitration also leaves the objectors free to press their claims in a later court action&#x97;if the arbitration&#x92;s result leaves them dissatisfied.  And, as the Union conceded at oral argument, the judge in that later action, though informed by the arbitrator&#x92;s decision, would not accord it any special legal weight.

				<em>

            <em>

				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">140</a> (1944)
 (administrative agency, through its interpretations, may have the &#x93;power to persuade, if lacking power to control&#x94;).  In other words, the objecting dissenter, though briefly delayed, could proceed in court and on a clean slate.  See Hensler, Court-Ordered Arbitration:  An Alternative View, U. Chi. Legal Forum 399, 401 (1990) (describing differences between mandatory 
				<em>
					non
				</em>
				-binding arbitration over agency fee calculations, and traditional mandatory 
				<em>
					binding
				</em>
				 arbitration).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				From the courts&#x92; perspective too, nonbinding arbitration can prove helpful.  Insofar as it settles matters to the parties&#x92; satisfaction, it avoids unnecessary, perhaps time-consuming, judicial investigation of highly complex union accounts and expense allocations.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Allen
				</em>
				, 373 U. S., at 122 (describing difficulties surrounding &#x93;judicially administered relief&#x94; for agency fee objectors, as compared with &#x93;internal union remedy&#x94;); 
				<em>
					Abood
				</em>
				, 431 U. S., at 240 (same).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The upshot is that the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule &#x93;prevent[s] compulsory subsidization of ideological activity&#x94; without unduly &#x93;restricting the Union&#x92;s ability&#x94; to collect a legitimate agency fee.  Consequently, neither the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>, nor any statute, as interpreted by this Court, prohibits the Union&#x92;s insistence upon that rule.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I fear that the majority is led to a different conclusion through use of analogies that, in my view, do not govern the circumstances before us.  First, the Court analogizes the arbitration at issue here to binding arbitration often found in contracts, including labor contracts, where arbitration is legally anchored in the consent of the parties.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 9.   But &#x93;consent&#x94; is not relevant to the legal justification for the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule before us.  Rather, that rule finds its legal anchor in the Union&#x92;s legal authority (indeed, obligation) under 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 to impose internal procedures that permit collection of agency fees, without undue infringement of objectors&#x92; constitutional rights.  I have explained above why the rule at issue here satisfies 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements.  If one needs an analogy, I would find it, not in consensual arbitration, but in court rules that require parties to try nonbinding arbitration before they pursue a case in court.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/651-658.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;651&#x96;658</a> (authorizing district courts to refer certain types of civil actions to arbitration); ADR Local Rules 2&#x96;3, 4&#x96;2 (ND Cal. 1998); see also Federal Judicial Center, Court-Annexed Arbitration in Ten District Courts (1990).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the Court describes the Union&#x92;s proposed &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule as an &#x93;extension of the discretionary exhaustion-of-remedies doctrine.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8&#x96;9.  But whether that particular doctrine offers legal justification in this case is beside the point.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule amounts to an elaboration of the obligations set forth in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.  Those obligations rested upon the substantive law that permits collection of agency fees interpreted in light of the competing demands of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 decided that this law required the courts to craft a mandatory, nonbinding mechanism for speedy dispute resolution.  Exhaustion principles did not prevent the Court from doing so.  Why then should those principles prevent the Court from elaborating upon 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements, by permitting a union to impose a reasonable &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule of the kind before us?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I note one additional matter.  The Court&#x92;s opinion refers to the &#x93;pilots &#x2026; proceed[ing] at once in federal court.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  The Court does not decide, however, whether a federal court can await the conclusion of an expeditious arbitration before it proceeds, for example, with discovery.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12&#x96;13, n. 6.  Should it await arbitration&#x92;s conclusion, the court would be able to take advantage of any settlement or narrowing of issues that the nonmandatory arbitration proceeding produced.  Doing so would alleviate many of the concerns that I have expressed in this opinion.  See
				<em>
					 supra
				</em>
				, at 3&#x96;5.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even so, the question before us is whether the Union can insist upon prior recourse to that form of arbitration.  For the reasons stated, I believe such a requirement is consistent with, and a reasonable extension of, this Court&#x92;s decision in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.

				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 to impose internal procedures that permit collection of agency fees, without undue infringement of objectors&#x92; constitutional rights.  I have explained above why the rule at issue here satisfies 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements.  If one needs an analogy, I would find it, not in consensual arbitration, but in court rules that require parties to try nonbinding arbitration before they pursue a case in court.  See,

				Second, the Court describes the Union&#x92;s proposed &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule as an &#x93;extension of the discretionary exhaustion-of-remedies doctrine.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8&#x96;9.  But whether that particular doctrine offers legal justification in this case is beside the point.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule amounts to an elaboration of the obligations set forth in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.  Those obligations rested upon the substantive law that permits collection of agency fees interpreted in light of the competing demands of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 decided that this law required the courts to craft a mandatory, nonbinding mechanism for speedy dispute resolution.  Exhaustion principles did not prevent the Court from doing so.  Why then should those principles prevent the Court from elaborating upon 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements, by permitting a union to impose a reasonable &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule of the kind before us?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I note one additional matter.  The Court&#x92;s opinion refers to the &#x93;pilots &#x2026; proceed[ing] at once in federal court.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  The Court does not decide, however, whether a federal court can await the conclusion of an expeditious arbitration before it proceeds, for example, with discovery.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12&#x96;13, n. 6.  Should it await arbitration&#x92;s conclusion, the court would be able to take advantage of any settlement or narrowing of issues that the nonmandatory arbitration proceeding produced.  Doing so would alleviate many of the concerns that I have expressed in this opinion.  See

				First, consider the matter from the Union&#x92;s perspective.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; requirement seems reasonable because it lowers the costs of resolving agency fee disputes and makes their resolution manageable.  As this case illustrates, different groups of nonmember dissenters with different motivations for objecting may proceed in different forums.  Without the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule, they might do so simultaneously.  Judge and arbitrator, perhaps subject to different discovery requests, obtaining somewhat different information, hearing different arguments, operating under different rules of procedure and evidence, and exercising different judgments (each without knowledge of the other), could well determine differently costs and complex expenditure relationships, thereby reaching different, even conflicting, conclusions.

				First, consider the matter from the Union&#x92;s perspective.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; requirement seems reasonable because it lowers the costs of resolving agency fee disputes and makes their resolution manageable.  As this case illustrates, different groups of nonmember dissenters with different motivations for objecting may proceed in different forums.  Without the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule, they might do so simultaneously.  Judge and arbitrator, perhaps subject to different discovery requests, obtaining somewhat different information, hearing different arguments, operating under different rules of procedure and evidence, and exercising different judgments (each without knowledge of the other), could well determine differently costs and complex expenditure relationships, thereby reaching different, even conflicting, conclusions.

				<em>
					Amicus

				 AFL&#x96;CIO adds that the &#x93;costs of defending such litigation&#x94; (which may involve no more than $50 or so for any individual dissenter, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 10) &#x93;can easily consume the union&#x92;s agency fee receipts.&#x94;  Brief for AFL&#x96;CIO as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 14, n. 5.  The Court itself recognizes as &#x93;[g]enuine&#x94; the Union&#x92;s &#x93;concern&#x94; about defending &#x93;its fee calculation simultaneously in judicial and arbitral fora.&#x94;  
				<em>

				, at 12.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, consider the matter from the perspective of the dissenting employee.  The Court&#x92;s decision, rejecting the Union&#x92;s rule, may help to protect the ideological interests of a few of those employees, but only a few, and then in a way that does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 offset the corresponding harm caused the Union.  That is because &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; does not mean serious delay, for the arbitration must begin promptly and proceed expeditiously. See 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 307.  Moreover, nonbinding arbitration may resolve the dispute to the satisfaction of some dissenting employees, perhaps those whose objections rest less upon ideology and more upon a desire to minimize the fee they must pay.  See 
				<em>
					Gilpin
				</em>
				 v.
				<em>
					 AFSCME
				</em>
				, 875 F. 2d 1310, 1313 (CA7 1989) (noting that many objectors are &#x93;free riders&#x94; seeking representation at the lowest cost possible); 
				<em>
					Weaver

				<em>
					Univ. of Cincinnati

				</em>
				 v.

				Nor will trying arbitration first prejudice the cause of the remaining unsatisfied objectors.  The nonbinding arbitration process may deprive objectors of their money for a brief additional time, but the disputed fees must remain unspent in escrow during the arbitration proceedings.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 305, 310.  Nonbinding arbitration also leaves the objectors free to press their claims in a later court action&#x97;if the arbitration&#x92;s result leaves them dissatisfied.  And, as the Union conceded at oral argument, the judge in that later action, though informed by the arbitrator&#x92;s decision, would not accord it any special legal weight.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 16, 20&#x96;21; see also 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				,
				<span class="softbreak"/>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 308, n. 21 (&#x93;arbitrator&#x92;s decision would not receive preclusive effect in any subsequent &#xA7;1983 action&#x94;).  Cf. 
				<em>
					Skidmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">140</a> (1944)
 (administrative agency, through its interpretations, may have the &#x93;power to persuade, if lacking power to control&#x94;).  In other words, the objecting dissenter, though briefly delayed, could proceed in court and on a clean slate.  See Hensler, Court-Ordered Arbitration:  An Alternative View, U. Chi. Legal Forum 399, 401 (1990) (describing differences between mandatory 
				<em>
					non
				</em>
				-binding arbitration over agency fee calculations, and traditional mandatory 
				<em>
					binding
				</em>
				 arbitration).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				From the courts&#x92; perspective too, nonbinding arbitration can prove helpful.  Insofar as it settles matters to the parties&#x92; satisfaction, it avoids unnecessary, perhaps time-consuming, judicial investigation of highly complex union accounts and expense allocations.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Allen
				</em>
				, 373 U. S., at 122 (describing difficulties surrounding &#x93;judicially administered relief&#x94; for agency fee objectors, as compared with &#x93;internal union remedy&#x94;); 
				<em>
					Abood
				</em>
				, 431 U. S., at 240 (same).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The upshot is that the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule &#x93;prevent[s] compulsory subsidization of ideological activity&#x94; without unduly &#x93;restricting the Union&#x92;s ability&#x94; to collect a legitimate agency fee.  Consequently, neither the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>, nor any statute, as interpreted by this Court, prohibits the Union&#x92;s insistence upon that rule.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I fear that the majority is led to a different conclusion through use of analogies that, in my view, do not govern the circumstances before us.  First, the Court analogizes the arbitration at issue here to binding arbitration often found in contracts, including labor contracts, where arbitration is legally anchored in the consent of the parties.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 9.   But &#x93;consent&#x94; is not relevant to the legal justification for the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule before us.  Rather, that rule finds its legal anchor in the Union&#x92;s legal authority (indeed, obligation) under 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 to impose internal procedures that permit collection of agency fees, without undue infringement of objectors&#x92; constitutional rights.  I have explained above why the rule at issue here satisfies 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements.  If one needs an analogy, I would find it, not in consensual arbitration, but in court rules that require parties to try nonbinding arbitration before they pursue a case in court.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/651-658.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;651&#x96;658</a> (authorizing district courts to refer certain types of civil actions to arbitration); ADR Local Rules 2&#x96;3, 4&#x96;2 (ND Cal. 1998); see also Federal Judicial Center, Court-Annexed Arbitration in Ten District Courts (1990).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the Court describes the Union&#x92;s proposed &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule as an &#x93;extension of the discretionary exhaustion-of-remedies doctrine.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8&#x96;9.  But whether that particular doctrine offers legal justification in this case is beside the point.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule amounts to an elaboration of the obligations set forth in

				First, consider the matter from the Union&#x92;s perspective.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; requirement seems reasonable because it lowers the costs of resolving agency fee disputes and makes their resolution manageable.  As this case illustrates, different groups of nonmember dissenters with different motivations for objecting may proceed in different forums.  Without the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule, they might do so simultaneously.  Judge and arbitrator, perhaps subject to different discovery requests, obtaining somewhat different information, hearing different arguments, operating under different rules of procedure and evidence, and exercising different judgments (each without knowledge of the other), could well determine differently costs and complex expenditure relationships, thereby reaching different, even conflicting, conclusions.

				Second, consider the matter from the perspective of the dissenting employee.  The Court&#x92;s decision, rejecting the Union&#x92;s rule, may help to protect the ideological interests of a few of those employees, but only a few, and then in a way that does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 offset the corresponding harm caused the Union.  That is because &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; does not mean serious delay, for the arbitration must begin promptly and proceed expeditiously. See 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 307.  Moreover, nonbinding arbitration may resolve the dispute to the satisfaction of some dissenting employees, perhaps those whose objections rest less upon ideology and more upon a desire to minimize the fee they must pay.  See 
				<em>
					Gilpin
				</em>
				 v.
				<em>
					 AFSCME
				</em>
				, 875 F. 2d 1310, 1313 (CA7 1989) (noting that many objectors are &#x93;free riders&#x94; seeking representation at the lowest cost possible);

				Nor will trying arbitration first prejudice the cause of the remaining unsatisfied objectors.  The nonbinding arbitration process may deprive objectors of their money for a brief additional time, but the disputed fees must remain unspent in escrow during the arbitration proceedings.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 305, 310.  Nonbinding arbitration also leaves the objectors free to press their claims in a later court action&#x97;if the arbitration&#x92;s result leaves them dissatisfied.  And, as the Union conceded at oral argument, the judge in that later action, though informed by the arbitrator&#x92;s decision, would not accord it any special legal weight.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 16, 20&#x96;21; see also 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>

				<span class="softbreak"/>
            <em>

				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">140</a> (1944)
 (administrative agency, through its interpretations, may have the &#x93;power to persuade, if lacking power to control&#x94;).  In other words, the objecting dissenter, though briefly delayed, could proceed in court and on a clean slate.  See Hensler, Court-Ordered Arbitration:  An Alternative View, U. Chi. Legal Forum 399, 401 (1990) (describing differences between mandatory 
				<em>
					non
				</em>
				-binding arbitration over agency fee calculations, and traditional mandatory 
				<em>
					binding
				</em>
				 arbitration).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				From the courts&#x92; perspective too, nonbinding arbitration can prove helpful.  Insofar as it settles matters to the parties&#x92; satisfaction, it avoids unnecessary, perhaps time-consuming, judicial investigation of highly complex union accounts and expense allocations.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Allen
				</em>
				, 373 U. S., at 122 (describing difficulties surrounding &#x93;judicially administered relief&#x94; for agency fee objectors, as compared with &#x93;internal union remedy&#x94;); 
				<em>
					Abood
				</em>
				, 431 U. S., at 240 (same).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The upshot is that the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule &#x93;prevent[s] compulsory subsidization of ideological activity&#x94; without unduly &#x93;restricting the Union&#x92;s ability&#x94; to collect a legitimate agency fee.  Consequently, neither the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>, nor any statute, as interpreted by this Court, prohibits the Union&#x92;s insistence upon that rule.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I fear that the majority is led to a different conclusion through use of analogies that, in my view, do not govern the circumstances before us.  First, the Court analogizes the arbitration at issue here to binding arbitration often found in contracts, including labor contracts, where arbitration is legally anchored in the consent of the parties.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 9.   But &#x93;consent&#x94; is not relevant to the legal justification for the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule before us.  Rather, that rule finds its legal anchor in the Union&#x92;s legal authority (indeed, obligation) under 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 to impose internal procedures that permit collection of agency fees, without undue infringement of objectors&#x92; constitutional rights.  I have explained above why the rule at issue here satisfies 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements.  If one needs an analogy, I would find it, not in consensual arbitration, but in court rules that require parties to try nonbinding arbitration before they pursue a case in court.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/651-658.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;651&#x96;658</a> (authorizing district courts to refer certain types of civil actions to arbitration); ADR Local Rules 2&#x96;3, 4&#x96;2 (ND Cal. 1998); see also Federal Judicial Center, Court-Annexed Arbitration in Ten District Courts (1990).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the Court describes the Union&#x92;s proposed &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule as an &#x93;extension of the discretionary exhaustion-of-remedies doctrine.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8&#x96;9.  But whether that particular doctrine offers legal justification in this case is beside the point.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule amounts to an elaboration of the obligations set forth in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.  Those obligations rested upon the substantive law that permits collection of agency fees interpreted in light of the competing demands of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 decided that this law required the courts to craft a mandatory, nonbinding mechanism for speedy dispute resolution.  Exhaustion principles did not prevent the Court from doing so.  Why then should those principles prevent the Court from elaborating upon 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements, by permitting a union to impose a reasonable &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule of the kind before us?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I note one additional matter.  The Court&#x92;s opinion refers to the &#x93;pilots &#x2026; proceed[ing] at once in federal court.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  The Court does not decide, however, whether a federal court can await the conclusion of an expeditious arbitration before it proceeds, for example, with discovery.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12&#x96;13, n. 6.  Should it await arbitration&#x92;s conclusion, the court would be able to take advantage of any settlement or narrowing of issues that the nonmandatory arbitration proceeding produced.  Doing so would alleviate many of the concerns that I have expressed in this opinion.  See
				<em>
					 supra
				</em>
				, at 3&#x96;5.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even so, the question before us is whether the Union can insist upon prior recourse to that form of arbitration.  For the reasons stated, I believe such a requirement is consistent with, and a reasonable extension of, this Court&#x92;s decision in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.

				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 to impose internal procedures that permit collection of agency fees, without undue infringement of objectors&#x92; constitutional rights.  I have explained above why the rule at issue here satisfies 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements.  If one needs an analogy, I would find it, not in consensual arbitration, but in court rules that require parties to try nonbinding arbitration before they pursue a case in court.  See,

				Second, the Court describes the Union&#x92;s proposed &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule as an &#x93;extension of the discretionary exhaustion-of-remedies doctrine.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8&#x96;9.  But whether that particular doctrine offers legal justification in this case is beside the point.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule amounts to an elaboration of the obligations set forth in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.  Those obligations rested upon the substantive law that permits collection of agency fees interpreted in light of the competing demands of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 decided that this law required the courts to craft a mandatory, nonbinding mechanism for speedy dispute resolution.  Exhaustion principles did not prevent the Court from doing so.  Why then should those principles prevent the Court from elaborating upon 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements, by permitting a union to impose a reasonable &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule of the kind before us?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I note one additional matter.  The Court&#x92;s opinion refers to the &#x93;pilots &#x2026; proceed[ing] at once in federal court.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  The Court does not decide, however, whether a federal court can await the conclusion of an expeditious arbitration before it proceeds, for example, with discovery.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12&#x96;13, n. 6.  Should it await arbitration&#x92;s conclusion, the court would be able to take advantage of any settlement or narrowing of issues that the nonmandatory arbitration proceeding produced.  Doing so would alleviate many of the concerns that I have expressed in this opinion.  See

				First, consider the matter from the Union&#x92;s perspective.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; requirement seems reasonable because it lowers the costs of resolving agency fee disputes and makes their resolution manageable.  As this case illustrates, different groups of nonmember dissenters with different motivations for objecting may proceed in different forums.  Without the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule, they might do so simultaneously.  Judge and arbitrator, perhaps subject to different discovery requests, obtaining somewhat different information, hearing different arguments, operating under different rules of procedure and evidence, and exercising different judgments (each without knowledge of the other), could well determine differently costs and complex expenditure relationships, thereby reaching different, even conflicting, conclusions.

				First, consider the matter from the Union&#x92;s perspective.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; requirement seems reasonable because it lowers the costs of resolving agency fee disputes and makes their resolution manageable.  As this case illustrates, different groups of nonmember dissenters with different motivations for objecting may proceed in different forums.  Without the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule, they might do so simultaneously.  Judge and arbitrator, perhaps subject to different discovery requests, obtaining somewhat different information, hearing different arguments, operating under different rules of procedure and evidence, and exercising different judgments (each without knowledge of the other), could well determine differently costs and complex expenditure relationships, thereby reaching different, even conflicting, conclusions.

				<em>
					Amicus

				 AFL&#x96;CIO adds that the &#x93;costs of defending such litigation&#x94; (which may involve no more than $50 or so for any individual dissenter, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 10) &#x93;can easily consume the union&#x92;s agency fee receipts.&#x94;  Brief for AFL&#x96;CIO as 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 14, n. 5.  The Court itself recognizes as &#x93;[g]enuine&#x94; the Union&#x92;s &#x93;concern&#x94; about defending &#x93;its fee calculation simultaneously in judicial and arbitral fora.&#x94;  
				<em>

				, at 12.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, consider the matter from the perspective of the dissenting employee.  The Court&#x92;s decision, rejecting the Union&#x92;s rule, may help to protect the ideological interests of a few of those employees, but only a few, and then in a way that does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 offset the corresponding harm caused the Union.  That is because &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; does not mean serious delay, for the arbitration must begin promptly and proceed expeditiously. See 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 307.  Moreover, nonbinding arbitration may resolve the dispute to the satisfaction of some dissenting employees, perhaps those whose objections rest less upon ideology and more upon a desire to minimize the fee they must pay.  See 
				<em>
					Gilpin
				</em>
				 v.
				<em>
					 AFSCME
				</em>
				, 875 F. 2d 1310, 1313 (CA7 1989) (noting that many objectors are &#x93;free riders&#x94; seeking representation at the lowest cost possible); 
				<em>
					Weaver

				<em>
					Univ. of Cincinnati

				</em>
				 v.

				Nor will trying arbitration first prejudice the cause of the remaining unsatisfied objectors.  The nonbinding arbitration process may deprive objectors of their money for a brief additional time, but the disputed fees must remain unspent in escrow during the arbitration proceedings.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 305, 310.  Nonbinding arbitration also leaves the objectors free to press their claims in a later court action&#x97;if the arbitration&#x92;s result leaves them dissatisfied.  And, as the Union conceded at oral argument, the judge in that later action, though informed by the arbitrator&#x92;s decision, would not accord it any special legal weight.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 16, 20&#x96;21; see also 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				,
				<span class="softbreak"/>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 308, n. 21 (&#x93;arbitrator&#x92;s decision would not receive preclusive effect in any subsequent &#xA7;1983 action&#x94;).  Cf. 
				<em>
					Skidmore
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">140</a> (1944)
 (administrative agency, through its interpretations, may have the &#x93;power to persuade, if lacking power to control&#x94;).  In other words, the objecting dissenter, though briefly delayed, could proceed in court and on a clean slate.  See Hensler, Court-Ordered Arbitration:  An Alternative View, U. Chi. Legal Forum 399, 401 (1990) (describing differences between mandatory 
				<em>
					non
				</em>
				-binding arbitration over agency fee calculations, and traditional mandatory 
				<em>
					binding
				</em>
				 arbitration).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				From the courts&#x92; perspective too, nonbinding arbitration can prove helpful.  Insofar as it settles matters to the parties&#x92; satisfaction, it avoids unnecessary, perhaps time-consuming, judicial investigation of highly complex union accounts and expense allocations.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Allen
				</em>
				, 373 U. S., at 122 (describing difficulties surrounding &#x93;judicially administered relief&#x94; for agency fee objectors, as compared with &#x93;internal union remedy&#x94;); 
				<em>
					Abood
				</em>
				, 431 U. S., at 240 (same).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The upshot is that the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule &#x93;prevent[s] compulsory subsidization of ideological activity&#x94; without unduly &#x93;restricting the Union&#x92;s ability&#x94; to collect a legitimate agency fee.  Consequently, neither the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>, nor any statute, as interpreted by this Court, prohibits the Union&#x92;s insistence upon that rule.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I fear that the majority is led to a different conclusion through use of analogies that, in my view, do not govern the circumstances before us.  First, the Court analogizes the arbitration at issue here to binding arbitration often found in contracts, including labor contracts, where arbitration is legally anchored in the consent of the parties.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 9.   But &#x93;consent&#x94; is not relevant to the legal justification for the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule before us.  Rather, that rule finds its legal anchor in the Union&#x92;s legal authority (indeed, obligation) under 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 to impose internal procedures that permit collection of agency fees, without undue infringement of objectors&#x92; constitutional rights.  I have explained above why the rule at issue here satisfies 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements.  If one needs an analogy, I would find it, not in consensual arbitration, but in court rules that require parties to try nonbinding arbitration before they pursue a case in court.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/651-658.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;651&#x96;658</a> (authorizing district courts to refer certain types of civil actions to arbitration); ADR Local Rules 2&#x96;3, 4&#x96;2 (ND Cal. 1998); see also Federal Judicial Center, Court-Annexed Arbitration in Ten District Courts (1990).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the Court describes the Union&#x92;s proposed &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule as an &#x93;extension of the discretionary exhaustion-of-remedies doctrine.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8&#x96;9.  But whether that particular doctrine offers legal justification in this case is beside the point.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule amounts to an elaboration of the obligations set forth in

				First, consider the matter from the Union&#x92;s perspective.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; requirement seems reasonable because it lowers the costs of resolving agency fee disputes and makes their resolution manageable.  As this case illustrates, different groups of nonmember dissenters with different motivations for objecting may proceed in different forums.  Without the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule, they might do so simultaneously.  Judge and arbitrator, perhaps subject to different discovery requests, obtaining somewhat different information, hearing different arguments, operating under different rules of procedure and evidence, and exercising different judgments (each without knowledge of the other), could well determine differently costs and complex expenditure relationships, thereby reaching different, even conflicting, conclusions.

				Second, consider the matter from the perspective of the dissenting employee.  The Court&#x92;s decision, rejecting the Union&#x92;s rule, may help to protect the ideological interests of a few of those employees, but only a few, and then in a way that does 
				<em>
					not
				</em>
				 offset the corresponding harm caused the Union.  That is because &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; does not mean serious delay, for the arbitration must begin promptly and proceed expeditiously. See 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 307.  Moreover, nonbinding arbitration may resolve the dispute to the satisfaction of some dissenting employees, perhaps those whose objections rest less upon ideology and more upon a desire to minimize the fee they must pay.  See 
				<em>
					Gilpin
				</em>
				 v.
				<em>
					 AFSCME
				</em>
				, 875 F. 2d 1310, 1313 (CA7 1989) (noting that many objectors are &#x93;free riders&#x94; seeking representation at the lowest cost possible);

				Nor will trying arbitration first prejudice the cause of the remaining unsatisfied objectors.  The nonbinding arbitration process may deprive objectors of their money for a brief additional time, but the disputed fees must remain unspent in escrow during the arbitration proceedings.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 305, 310.  Nonbinding arbitration also leaves the objectors free to press their claims in a later court action&#x97;if the arbitration&#x92;s result leaves them dissatisfied.  And, as the Union conceded at oral argument, the judge in that later action, though informed by the arbitrator&#x92;s decision, would not accord it any special legal weight.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 16, 20&#x96;21; see also 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>

				<span class="softbreak"/>
            <em>

				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">140</a> (1944)
 (administrative agency, through its interpretations, may have the &#x93;power to persuade, if lacking power to control&#x94;).  In other words, the objecting dissenter, though briefly delayed, could proceed in court and on a clean slate.  See Hensler, Court-Ordered Arbitration:  An Alternative View, U. Chi. Legal Forum 399, 401 (1990) (describing differences between mandatory 
				<em>
					non
				</em>
				-binding arbitration over agency fee calculations, and traditional mandatory 
				<em>
					binding
				</em>
				 arbitration).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				From the courts&#x92; perspective too, nonbinding arbitration can prove helpful.  Insofar as it settles matters to the parties&#x92; satisfaction, it avoids unnecessary, perhaps time-consuming, judicial investigation of highly complex union accounts and expense allocations.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Allen
				</em>
				, 373 U. S., at 122 (describing difficulties surrounding &#x93;judicially administered relief&#x94; for agency fee objectors, as compared with &#x93;internal union remedy&#x94;); 
				<em>
					Abood
				</em>
				, 431 U. S., at 240 (same).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The upshot is that the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule &#x93;prevent[s] compulsory subsidization of ideological activity&#x94; without unduly &#x93;restricting the Union&#x92;s ability&#x94; to collect a legitimate agency fee.  Consequently, neither the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>, nor any statute, as interpreted by this Court, prohibits the Union&#x92;s insistence upon that rule.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I fear that the majority is led to a different conclusion through use of analogies that, in my view, do not govern the circumstances before us.  First, the Court analogizes the arbitration at issue here to binding arbitration often found in contracts, including labor contracts, where arbitration is legally anchored in the consent of the parties.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 9.   But &#x93;consent&#x94; is not relevant to the legal justification for the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule before us.  Rather, that rule finds its legal anchor in the Union&#x92;s legal authority (indeed, obligation) under 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 to impose internal procedures that permit collection of agency fees, without undue infringement of objectors&#x92; constitutional rights.  I have explained above why the rule at issue here satisfies 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements.  If one needs an analogy, I would find it, not in consensual arbitration, but in court rules that require parties to try nonbinding arbitration before they pursue a case in court.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/651-658.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;651&#x96;658</a> (authorizing district courts to refer certain types of civil actions to arbitration); ADR Local Rules 2&#x96;3, 4&#x96;2 (ND Cal. 1998); see also Federal Judicial Center, Court-Annexed Arbitration in Ten District Courts (1990).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the Court describes the Union&#x92;s proposed &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule as an &#x93;extension of the discretionary exhaustion-of-remedies doctrine.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8&#x96;9.  But whether that particular doctrine offers legal justification in this case is beside the point.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule amounts to an elaboration of the obligations set forth in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.  Those obligations rested upon the substantive law that permits collection of agency fees interpreted in light of the competing demands of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 decided that this law required the courts to craft a mandatory, nonbinding mechanism for speedy dispute resolution.  Exhaustion principles did not prevent the Court from doing so.  Why then should those principles prevent the Court from elaborating upon 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements, by permitting a union to impose a reasonable &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule of the kind before us?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I note one additional matter.  The Court&#x92;s opinion refers to the &#x93;pilots &#x2026; proceed[ing] at once in federal court.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  The Court does not decide, however, whether a federal court can await the conclusion of an expeditious arbitration before it proceeds, for example, with discovery.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12&#x96;13, n. 6.  Should it await arbitration&#x92;s conclusion, the court would be able to take advantage of any settlement or narrowing of issues that the nonmandatory arbitration proceeding produced.  Doing so would alleviate many of the concerns that I have expressed in this opinion.  See
				<em>
					 supra
				</em>
				, at 3&#x96;5.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even so, the question before us is whether the Union can insist upon prior recourse to that form of arbitration.  For the reasons stated, I believe such a requirement is consistent with, and a reasonable extension of, this Court&#x92;s decision in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.

				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 to impose internal procedures that permit collection of agency fees, without undue infringement of objectors&#x92; constitutional rights.  I have explained above why the rule at issue here satisfies 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements.  If one needs an analogy, I would find it, not in consensual arbitration, but in court rules that require parties to try nonbinding arbitration before they pursue a case in court.  See,

				Second, the Court describes the Union&#x92;s proposed &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule as an &#x93;extension of the discretionary exhaustion-of-remedies doctrine.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 8&#x96;9.  But whether that particular doctrine offers legal justification in this case is beside the point.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule amounts to an elaboration of the obligations set forth in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.  Those obligations rested upon the substantive law that permits collection of agency fees interpreted in light of the competing demands of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 decided that this law required the courts to craft a mandatory, nonbinding mechanism for speedy dispute resolution.  Exhaustion principles did not prevent the Court from doing so.  Why then should those principles prevent the Court from elaborating upon 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements, by permitting a union to impose a reasonable &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule of the kind before us?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I note one additional matter.  The Court&#x92;s opinion refers to the &#x93;pilots &#x2026; proceed[ing] at once in federal court.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  The Court does not decide, however, whether a federal court can await the conclusion of an expeditious arbitration before it proceeds, for example, with discovery.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12&#x96;13, n. 6.  Should it await arbitration&#x92;s conclusion, the court would be able to take advantage of any settlement or narrowing of issues that the nonmandatory arbitration proceeding produced.  Doing so would alleviate many of the concerns that I have expressed in this opinion.  See

				First, consider the matter from the Union&#x92;s perspective.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; requirement seems reasonable because it lowers the costs of resolving agency fee disputes and makes their resolution manageable.  As this case illustrates, different groups of nonmember dissenters with different motivations for objecting may proceed in different forums.  Without the &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule, they might do so simultaneously.  Judge and arbitrator, perhaps subject to different discovery requests, obtaining somewhat different information, hearing different arguments, operating under different rules of procedure and evidence, and exercising different judgments (each without knowledge of the other), could well determine differently costs and complex expenditure relationships, thereby reaching different, even conflicting, conclusions.

				, at 8&#x96;9.  But whether that particular doctrine offers legal justification in this case is beside the point.  The &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule amounts to an elaboration of the obligations set forth in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.  Those obligations rested upon the substantive law that permits collection of agency fees interpreted in light of the competing demands of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>.  
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				 decided that this law required the courts to craft a mandatory, nonbinding mechanism for speedy dispute resolution.  Exhaustion principles did not prevent the Court from doing so.  Why then should those principles prevent the Court from elaborating upon 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				&#x92;s requirements, by permitting a union to impose a reasonable &#x93;arbitration first&#x94; rule of the kind before us?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				I note one additional matter.  The Court&#x92;s opinion refers to the &#x93;pilots &#x2026; proceed[ing] at once in federal court.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 2.  The Court does not decide, however, whether a federal court can await the conclusion of an expeditious arbitration before it proceeds, for example, with discovery.  
				<em>
					Ante
				</em>
				, at 12&#x96;13, n. 6.  Should it await arbitration&#x92;s conclusion, the court would be able to take advantage of any settlement or narrowing of issues that the nonmandatory arbitration proceeding produced.  Doing so would alleviate many of the concerns that I have expressed in this opinion.  See
				<em>
					 supra
				</em>
				, at 3&#x96;5.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Even so, the question before us is whether the Union can insist upon prior recourse to that form of arbitration.  For the reasons stated, I believe such a requirement is consistent with, and a reasonable extension of, this Court&#x92;s decision in 
				<em>
					Hudson
				</em>
				.

				I therefore dissent.
