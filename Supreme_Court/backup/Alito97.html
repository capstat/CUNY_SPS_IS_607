        <h4 class="sylctb">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit</h4>
        <hr/>
        <div class="opiniondates">No. 05&#x96;184.Argued March 28, 2006&#x97;Decided June 29, 2006</div>
        <hr/>
        <p class="bodytext">Pursuant to Congress&#x92; Joint Resolution authorizing the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided&#x94; the September 11, 2001, al Qaeda terrorist attacks (AUMF), U. S. Armed Forces invaded Afghanistan.  During the hostilities, in 2001, militia forces captured petitioner Hamdan, a Yemeni national, and turned him over to the U. S. military, which, in 2002, transported him to prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  Over a year later, the President deemed Hamdan eligible for trial by military commission for then-unspecified crimes.  After another year, he was charged with conspiracy &#x93;to commit &#x2026; offenses triable by military commission.&#x94;  In habeas and mandamus petitions, Hamdan asserted that the military commission lacks authority to try him because (1) neither congressional Act nor the common law of war supports trial by this commission for conspiracy, an offense that, Hamdan says, is not a violation of the law of war; and (2) the procedures adopted to try him violate basic tenets of military and international law, including the principle that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear the evidence against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">        The District Court granted habeas relief and stayed the commission&#x92;s proceedings, concluding that the President&#x92;s authority to establish military commissions extends only to offenders or offenses triable by such a commission under the law of war; that such law includes the Third Geneva Convention; that Hamdan is entitled to that Convention&#x92;s full protections until adjudged, under it, not to be a prisoner of war; and that, whether or not Hamdan is properly classified a prisoner of war, the commission convened to try him was established in violation of both the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ),

            <em>et seq.</em>, and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva Convention because it had the power to convict based on evidence the accused would never see or hear.  The D. C. Circuit reversed.  Although it declined the Government&#x92;s invitation to abstain from considering Hamdan&#x92;s challenge, cf. <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a>, the appeals court ruled, on the merits, that Hamdan was not entitled to relief because the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable.  The court also concluded that <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/1" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 1</a>, foreclosed any separation-of-powers objection to the military commission&#x92;s jurisdiction, and that Hamdan&#x92;s trial before the commission would violate neither the UCMJ nor Armed Forces regulations implementing the Geneva Conventions.  </p>

        <p class="SYLCTF">
            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Stevens</span> delivered the opinion of the Court, except as to Parts V and VI&#x96;D&#x96;iv, concluding:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    1. The Government&#x92;s motion to dismiss, based on the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), is denied.  DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(1) provides that &#x93;no court &#x2026; shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider &#x2026; an application for &#x2026; habeas corpus filed by &#x2026; an alien detained &#x2026; at Guantanamo Bay.&#x94;  Section 1005(h)(2) provides that &#xA7;&#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)&#x97;which give the D. C. Circuit &#x93;exclusive&#x94; jurisdiction to review the final decisions of, respectively, combatant status review tribunals and military commissions&#x97;&#x93;shall apply with respect to any claim whose review is &#x2026; pending on&#x94; the DTA&#x92;s effective date, as was Hamdan&#x92;s case.  The Government&#x92;s argument that &#xA7;&#xA7;1005(e)(1) and (h) repeal this Court&#x92;s jurisdiction to review the decision below is rebutted by ordinary principles of statutory construction.  A negative inference may be drawn from Congress&#x92; failure to include &#xA7;1005(e)(1) within the scope of &#xA7;1005(h)(2).  Cf., <em>e.g.,</em>
            <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a>.  &#x93;If &#x2026; Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure that [&#xA7;&#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)] be applied to pending cases, it should have been just as concerned about [&#xA7;1005(e)(1)], unless it had the different intent that the latter [section] not be applied to the general run of pending cases.&#x94;  <em>Id.,</em> at 329.  If anything, the evidence of deliberate omission is stronger here than it was in <em>Lindh</em>.  The legislative history shows that Congress not only considered the respective temporal reaches of &#xA7;&#xA7;1005(e)(1), (2), and (3) together at every stage, but omitted paragraph (1) from its directive only after having <em>rejected</em> earlier proposed versions of the statute that would have included what is now paragraph (1) within that directive&#x92;s scope.  Congress&#x92; rejection of the very language that would have achieved the result the Government urges weighs heavily against the Government&#x92;s interpretation.  See <em>Doe</em> v. <em>Chao,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/540/614" class="subref" title="subref">540 U. S. 614</a>.  Pp. 7&#x96;20.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    2. The Government argues unpersuasively that abstention is appropriate under <em>Councilman,</em> which concluded that, as a matter of comity, federal courts should normally abstain from intervening in pending courts-martial against service members, see 420 U. S., at 740.  Neither of the comity considerations <em>Councilman</em> identified weighs in favor of abstention here.  First, the assertion that military discipline and, therefore, the Armed Forces&#x92; efficient operation, are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts, see <em>id.,</em> at 752, is inapt because Hamdan is not a service member.  Second, the view that federal courts should respect the balance Congress struck when it created &#x93;an integrated system of military courts and review procedures&#x94; is inapposite, since the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of that integrated system.  Rather than <em>Councilman,</em> the most relevant precedent is <em>Ex parte Quirin</em>, where the Court, far from abstaining pending the conclusion of ongoing military proceedings, expedited its review because of (1) the public importance of the questions raised, (2) the Court&#x92;s duty, in both peace and war, to preserve the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty, and (3) the public interest in a decision on those questions without delay, 317 U. S, at 19.  The Government has identified no countervailing interest that would permit federal courts to depart from their general duty to exercise the jurisdiction Congress has conferred on them.  Pp. 20&#x96;25.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    3. The military commission at issue is not expressly authorized by any congressional Act.  <em>Quirin</em> held that Congress had, through Article of War 15, sanctioned the use of military commissions to try offenders or offenses against the law of war.  317 U. S., at 28.  UCMJ Art. 21, which is substantially identical to the old Art. 15, reads: &#x93;The jurisdiction [of] courts-martial shall not be construed as depriving military commissions &#x2026; of concurrent jurisdiction in respect of offenders or offenses that by statute or by the law of war may be tried by such &#x2026; commissions.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/821.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;821</a>.  Contrary to the Government&#x92;s assertion, even <em>Quirin</em> did not view that authorization as a sweeping mandate for the President to invoke military commissions whenever he deems them necessary.  Rather, <em>Quirin</em> recognized that Congress had simply preserved what power, under the Constitution and the common law of war, the President already had to convene military commissions&#x97;with the express condition that he and those under his command comply with the law of war.  See 317 U. S., at 28&#x96;29.  Neither the AUMF nor the DTA can be read to provide specific, overriding authorization for the commission convened to try Hamdan.  Assuming the AUMF activated the President&#x92;s war powers, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>,<em/>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/507" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 507</a>, and that those powers include authority to convene military commissions in appropriate circumstances, see, <em>e.g.,</em>
            <em>id.</em>, at 518, there is nothing in the AUMF&#x92;s text or legislative history even hinting that Congress intended to expand or alter the authorization set forth in UCMJ Art. 21.  Cf. <em>Ex parte Yerger,</em> 8 Wall. 85, 105.  Likewise, the DTA cannot be read to authorize this commission.  Although the DTA, unlike either Art. 21 or the AUMF, was enacted after the President convened Hamdan&#x92;s commission, it contains no language authorizing that tribunal or any other at Guantanamo Bay.  Together, the UCMJ, the AUMF, and the DTA at most acknowledge a general Presidential authority to convene military commissions in circumstances where justified under the Constitution and laws, including the law of war.  Absent a more specific congressional authorization, this Court&#x92;s task is, as it was in <em>Quirin</em>, to decide whether Hamdan&#x92;s military commission is so justified.  Pp. 25&#x96;30.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    4. The military commission at issue lacks the power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.  Pp. 49&#x96;72.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (a) The commission&#x92;s procedures, set forth in Commission Order No. 1, provide, among other things, that an accused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from, and precluded from ever learning what evidence was presented during, any part of the proceeding the official who appointed the commission or the presiding officer decides to &#x93;close.&#x94;  Grounds for closure include the protection of classified information, the physical safety of participants and witnesses, the protection of intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or activities, and &#x93;other national security interests.&#x94;  Appointed military defense counsel must be privy to these closed sessions, but may, at the presiding officer&#x92;s discretion, be forbidden to reveal to the client what took place therein.  Another striking feature is that the rules governing Hamdan&#x92;s commission permit the admission of <em>any</em> evidence that, in the presiding officer&#x92;s opinion, would have probative value to a reasonable person.  Moreover, the accused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to classified and other &#x93;protected information,&#x94; so long as the presiding officer concludes that the evidence is &#x93;probative&#x94; and that its admission without the accused&#x92;s knowledge would not result in the denial of a full and fair trial.  Pp. 49&#x96;52.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (b) The Government objects to this Court&#x92;s consideration of a procedural challenge at this stage on the grounds, <em>inter alia,</em> that Hamdan will be able to raise such a challenge following a final decision under the DTA, and that there is no basis to presume, before the trial has even commenced, that it will not be conducted in good faith and according to law.  These contentions are unsound.  First, because Hamdan apparently is not subject to the death penalty (at least as matters now stand) and may receive a prison sentence shorter than 10 years, he has no automatic right to federal-court review of the commission&#x92;s &#x93;final decision&#x94; under DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3).  Second, there <em>is</em> a basis to presume that the procedures employed during Hamdan&#x92;s trial will violate the law: He will be, and <em>indeed already has been</em>, excluded from his own trial.  Thus, review of the procedures in advance of a &#x93;final decision&#x94; is appropriate.  Pp. 52&#x96;53. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (c) Because UCMJ Article 36 has not been complied with here, the rules specified for Hamdan&#x92;s commission trial are illegal.  The procedures governing such trials historically have been the same as those governing courts-martial.  Although this uniformity principle is not inflexible and does not preclude all departures from courts-martial procedures, any such departure must be tailored to the exigency that necessitates it.  That understanding is reflected in Art. 36(b), which provides that the procedural rules the President promulgates for courts-martial and military commissions alike must be &#x93;uniform insofar as practicable,&#x94; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/836.html#b" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;836(b)</a>.  The &#x93;practicability&#x94; determination the President has made is insufficient to justify variances from the procedures governing courts-martial.  The President here has determined, pursuant to the requirement of <em>Art. 36(a),</em> that it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that govern &#x93;the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts&#x94; to Hamdan&#x92;s commission.  The President has not, however, made a similar official determination that it is impracticable to apply the rules for courts-martial.  And even if subsection (b)&#x92;s requirements could be satisfied without an official practicability determination, that subsection&#x92;s requirements are not satisfied here.  Nothing in the record demonstrates that it would be impracticable to apply court-martial rules here.  There is no suggestion, <em>e.g.,</em> of any logistical difficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in applying the usual principles of relevance and admissibility.  It is not evident why the danger posed by international terrorism, considerable though it is, should require, in the case of Hamdan&#x92;s trial, any variance from the courts-martial rules.  The absence of any showing of impracticability is particularly disturbing when considered in light of the clear and admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamental protections afforded not just by the Manual for Courts-Martial but also by the UCMJ itself: The right to be present.  See 
10 U. S. C. A. &#xA7;839(c).  Because the jettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as &#x93;practicable,&#x94; the courts-martial rules must apply.  Since it is undisputed that Commission Order No. 1 deviates in many significant respects from those rules, it necessarily violates Art. 36(b).  Pp. 53&#x96;62. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (d) The procedures adopted to try Hamdan also violate the Geneva Conventions.  The D. C. Circuit dismissed Hamdan&#x92;s challenge in this regard on the grounds, <em>inter alia, </em>that the Conventions are not judicially enforceable and that, in any event, Hamdan is not entitled to their protections.  Neither of these grounds is persuasive.  Pp. 62&#x96;68.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">            (i) The appeals court relied on a statement in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/339/763" class="subref" title="subref">339 U. S. 763</a>, n. 14, suggesting that this Court lacked power even to consider the merits of a Convention argument because the political and military authorities had sole responsibility for observing and enforcing prisoners&#x92; rights under the Convention.  However, <em>Eisentrager</em> does not control here because, regardless of the nature of the rights conferred on Hamdan, cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rauscher,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/119/407" class="subref" title="subref">119 U. S. 407</a>, they are indisputably part of the law of war, see <em>Hamdi, </em>542 U. S., at 520&#x96;521, compliance with which is the condition upon which UCMJ Art. 21 authority is granted.  Pp. 63&#x96;65.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">            (ii) Alternatively, the appeals court agreed with the Government that the Conventions do not apply because Hamdan was captured during the war with al Qaeda, which is not a Convention signatory, and that conflict is distinct from the war with signatory Afghanistan.  The Court need not decide the merits of this argument because there is at least one provision of the Geneva Conventions that applies here even if the relevant conflict is not between signatories. Common Article 3, which appears in all four Conventions, provides that, in a &#x93;conflict not of an international character occurring in the territory of one of the High Contracting Parties [<em>i.e.,</em> signatories], each Party to the conflict shall be bound to apply, as a minimum,&#x94; certain provisions protecting &#x93;[p]ersons &#x2026; placed <em>hors de combat</em> by &#x2026; detention,&#x94; including a prohibition on &#x93;the passing of sentences &#x2026; without previous judgment &#x2026; by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees &#x2026; recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.&#x94;  The D. C. Circuit ruled Common Article 3 inapplicable to Hamdan because the conflict with al Qaeda is international in scope and thus not a &#x93;conflict not of an international character. &#x94;  That reasoning is erroneous.  That the quoted phrase bears its literal meaning and is used here in contradistinction to a conflict between nations is demonstrated by Common Article 2, which limits its own application to any armed conflict between signatories and provides that signatories must abide by all terms of the Conventions even if another party to the conflict is a nonsignatory, so long as the nonsignatory &#x93;accepts and applies&#x94; those terms.  Common Article 3, by contrast, affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory who are involved in a conflict &#x93;in the territory of&#x94; a signatory.  The latter kind of conflict does not involve a clash between nations (whether signatories or not).  Pp. 65&#x96;68.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">            (iii) While Common Article 3 does not define its &#x93;regularly constituted court&#x94; phrase, other sources define the words to mean an &#x93;ordinary military cour[t]&#x94; that is &#x93;established and organized in accordance with the laws and procedures already in force in a country.&#x94;  The regular military courts in our system are the courts-martial established by congressional statute.  At a minimum, a military commission can be &#x93;regularly constituted&#x94; only if some practical need explains deviations from court-martial practice.  No such need has been demonstrated here.  Pp. 69&#x96;70.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">            (iv) Common Article 3&#x92;s requirements are general, crafted to accommodate a wide variety of legal systems, but they are <em>requirements</em> nonetheless.  The commission convened to try Hamdan does not meet those requirements.  P. 72.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">        (d) Even assuming that Hamden is a dangerous individual who would cause great harm or death to innocent civilians given the opportunity, the Executive nevertheless must comply with the prevailing rule of law in undertaking to try him and subject him to criminal punishment.  P. 72.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Stevens</span>, joined by <span class="smallcaps">Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg</span>, and <span class="smallcaps">Justice Breyer</span>, concluded in Parts V and VI&#x96;D&#x96;iv:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    1. The Government has not charged Hamdan with an &#x93;offense &#x2026; that by the law of war may be tried by military commission,&#x94; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/821.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;821</a>.  Of the three sorts of military commissions used historically, the law-of-war type used in <em>Quirin </em>and other cases is the only model available to try Hamdan.  Among the preconditions, incorporated in Article of War 15 and, later, UCMJ Art. 21, for such a tribunal&#x92;s exercise of jurisdiction are, <em>inter alia, </em>that it must be limited to trying offenses committed within the convening commander&#x92;s field of command, <em>i.e., </em>within the theater of war, and that the offense charged must have been committed during, not before or after, the war.  Here, Hamdan is not alleged to have committed any overt act in a theater of war or on any specified date after September 11, 2001.  More importantly, the offense alleged is not triable by law-of-war military commission.  Although the common law of war may render triable by military commission certain offenses not defined by statute, <em>Quirin, </em>317 U. S., at 30, the precedent for doing so with respect to a particular offense must be plain and unambiguous, cf., <em>e.g., Loving</em> v. <em>United States,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/748" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 748</a>.  That burden is far from satisfied here.  The crime of &#x93;conspiracy&#x94; has rarely if ever been tried as such in this country by any law-of-war military commission not exercising some other form of jurisdiction, and does not appear in either the Geneva Conventions or the Hague Conventions&#x97;the major treaties on the law of war.  Moreover, that conspiracy is not a recognized violation of the law of war is confirmed by other international sources, including, <em>e.g., </em>the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, which pointedly refused to recognize conspiracy to commit war crimes as such a violation.  Because the conspiracy charge does not support the commission&#x92;s jurisdiction, the commission lacks authority to try Hamdan.  Pp. 30&#x96;49. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    2. The phrase &#x93;all the guarantees &#x2026; recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples&#x94; in Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions is not defined, but it must be understood to incorporate at least the barest of the trial protections recognized by customary international law.  The procedures adopted to try Hamdan deviate from those governing courts-martial in ways not justified by practical need, and thus fail to afford the requisite guarantees.  Moreover, various provisions of Commission Order No. 1 dispense with the principles, which are indisputably part of customary international law, that an accused must, absent disruptive conduct or consent, be present for his trial and must be privy to the evidence against him.  Pp. 70&#x96;72. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Kennedy, </span>agreeing that Hamdan&#x92;s military commission is unauthorized under the Uniform Code of Military Justice,

            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Stevens</span> announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I through IV, Parts VI through VI&#x96;D&#x96;iii, Part VI&#x96;D&#x96;v, and Part VII, and an opinion with respect to Parts V and VI&#x96;D&#x96;iv, in which <span class="smallcaps">Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, </span>and <span class="smallcaps">Justice Breyer</span> join.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni national, is in custody at an American prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  In November 2001, during hostilities between the United States and the Taliban (which then governed Afghanistan), Hamdan was captured by militia forces and turned over to the U. S. military.  In June 2002, he was transported to Guantanamo Bay.  Over a year later, the President deemed him eligible for trial by military commission for then-unspecified crimes.  After another year had passed, Hamdan was charged with one count of conspiracy &#x93;to commit &#x2026; offenses triable by military commission.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus and mandamus to challenge the Executive Branch&#x92;s intended means of prosecuting this charge.  He concedes that a court-martial constituted in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/801.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;801</a>
            <em>et seq.</em> (2000 ed. and Supp. III), would have authority to try him.  His objection is that the military commission the President has convened lacks such authority, for two principal reasons: First, neither congressional Act nor the common law of war supports trial by this commission for the crime of conspiracy&#x97;an offense that, Hamdan says, is not a violation of the law of war.  Second, Hamdan contends, the procedures that the President has adopted to try him violate the most basic tenets of military and international law, including the principle that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear the evidence against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The District Court granted Hamdan&#x92;s request for a writ of habeas corpus.  344 F. Supp. 2d 152 (DC 2004).  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  415 F. 3d 33 (2005).  Recognizing, as we did over a half-century ago, that trial by military commission is an extraordinary measure raising important questions about the balance of powers in our constitutional structure, <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>

, we granted certiorari.  546 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the military commission convened to try Hamdan lacks power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the Geneva Conventions.  Four of us also conclude, see Part V, <em>infra</em>, that the offense with which Hamdan has been charged is not an &#x93;offens[e] that by &#x2026; the law of war may be tried by military commissions.&#x94;  10  U.

        <p class="bodytext">    On September 11, 2001, agents of the al Qaeda terrorist organization hijacked commercial airplanes and attacked the World Trade Center in New York City and the national headquarters of the Department of Defense in Arlington, Virginia.  Americans will never forget the devastation wrought by these acts.  Nearly 3,000 civilians were killed.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Congress responded by adopting a Joint Resolution authorizing the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks &#x2026; in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF),

224, note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1541.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. &#xA7;1541</a> (2000 ed., Supp. III).  Acting pursuant to the AUMF, and having determined that the Taliban regime had supported al Qaeda, the President ordered the Armed Forces of the United States to invade Afghanistan.  In the ensuing hostilities, hundreds of individuals, Hamdan among them, were captured and eventually detained at Guantanamo Bay.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On November 13, 2001, while the United States was still engaged in active combat with the Taliban, the President issued a comprehensive military order intended to govern the &#x93;Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,&#x94; 66 Fed. Reg. 57833 (hereinafter November 13 Order or Order).  Those subject to the November 13 Order include any noncitizen for whom the President determines &#x93;there is reason to believe&#x94; that he or she (1) &#x93;is or was&#x94; a member of al Qaeda or (2) has engaged or participated in terrorist activities aimed at or harmful to the United States.  <em>Id.</em>, at 57834.  Any such individual &#x93;shall, when tried, be tried by military commission for any and all offenses triable by military commission that such individual is alleged to have committed, and may be punished in accordance with the penalties provided under applicable law, including imprisonment or death.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  The November 13 Order vested in the Secretary of Defense the power to appoint military commissions to try individuals subject to the Order, but that power has since been delegated to John D. Altenberg, Jr., a retired Army major general and longtime military lawyer who has been designated &#x93;Appointing Authority for Military Commissions.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On July 3, 2003, the President announced his determination that Hamdan and five other detainees at Guantanamo Bay were subject to the November 13 Order and thus triable by military commission.  In December 2003, military counsel was appointed to represent Hamdan.  Two months later, counsel filed demands for charges and for a speedy trial pursuant to Article 10 of the UCMJ, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/810.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;810</a>.  On February 23, 2004, the legal adviser to the Appointing Authority denied the applications, ruling that Hamdan was not entitled to any of the protections of the UCMJ.  Not until July 13, 2004, after Hamdan had commenced this action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, did the Government finally charge him with the offense for which, a year earlier, he had been deemed eligible for trial by military commission.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The charging document, which is unsigned, contains 13 numbered paragraphs.  The first two paragraphs recite the asserted bases for the military commission&#x92;s jurisdiction&#x97;namely, the November 13 Order and the President&#x92;s July 3, 2003, declaration that Hamdan is eligible for trial by military commission.  The next nine paragraphs, collectively entitled &#x93;General Allegations,&#x94; describe al Qaeda&#x92;s activities from its inception in 1989 through 2001 and identify Osama bin Laden as the group&#x92;s leader.  Hamdan is not mentioned in these paragraphs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Only the final two paragraphs, entitled &#x93;Charge: Conspiracy,&#x94; contain allegations against Hamdan.  Paragraph 12 charges that &#x93;from on or about February 1996 to on or about November 24, 2001,&#x94; Hamdan &#x93;willfully and knowingly joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose and conspired and agreed with [named members of al Qaeda] to commit the following offenses triable by military commission: attacking civilians; attacking civilian objects; murder by an unprivileged belligerent; and terrorism.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.  There is no allegation that Hamdan had any command responsibilities, played a leadership role, or participated in the planning of any activity.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Paragraph 13 lists four &#x93;overt acts&#x94; that Hamdan is alleged to have committed sometime between 1996 and November 2001 in furtherance of the &#x93;enterprise and conspiracy&#x94;: (1) he acted as Osama bin Laden&#x92;s &#x93;bodyguard and personal driver,&#x94; &#x93;believ[ing]&#x94; all the while that bin Laden &#x93;and his associates were involved in&#x94; terrorist acts prior to and including the attacks of September 11, 2001; (2) he arranged for transportation of, and actually transported, weapons used by al Qaeda members and by bin Laden&#x92;s bodyguards (Hamdan among them); (3) he &#x93;drove or accompanied [O]sama bin Laden to various al Qaida-sponsored training camps, press conferences, or lectures,&#x94; at which bin Laden encouraged attacks against Americans; and (4) he received weapons training at al Qaeda-sponsored camps.  <em>Id.</em>, at 65a&#x96;67a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After this formal charge was filed, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington transferred Hamdan&#x92;s habeas and mandamus petitions to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  Meanwhile, a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) convened pursuant to a military order issued on July 7, 2004, decided that Hamdan&#x92;s continued detention at Guantanamo Bay was warranted because he was an &#x93;enemy combatant.&#x94;<a name="ZO-1ref" href="#ZO-1" class="">

            </a>  Separately, proceedings before the military commission commenced.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On November 8, 2004, however, the District Court granted Hamdan&#x92;s petition for habeas corpus and stayed the commission&#x92;s proceedings.  It concluded that the President&#x92;s authority to establish military commissions extends only to &#x93;offenders or offenses triable by military [commission] under the law of war,&#x94; 344 F. Supp. 2d, at 158; that the law of war includes the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, T. I. A. S. No. 3364 (Third Geneva Convention); that Hamdan is entitled to the full protections of the Third Geneva Convention until adjudged, in compliance with that treaty, not to be a prisoner of war; and that, whether or not Hamdan is properly classified as a prisoner of war, the military commission convened to try him was established in violation of both the UCMJ and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva Convention because it had the power to convict based on evidence the accused would never see or hear.  344 F. Supp. 2d, at 158&#x96;172.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals declined the Government&#x92;s invitation to abstain from considering Hamdan&#x92;s challenge.  Cf. <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a> (1975)
.  On the merits, the panel rejected the District Court&#x92;s further conclusion that Hamdan was entitled to relief under the Third Geneva Convention.  All three judges agreed that the Geneva Conventions were not &#x93;judicially enforceable,&#x94; 415 F. 3d, at 38, and two thought that the Conventions did not in any event apply to Hamdan, <em>id.</em>, at 40&#x96;42; but see <em>id.</em>, at 44 (Williams, J., concurring).  In other portions of its opinion, the court concluded that our decision in <em>Quirin</em> foreclosed any separation-of-powers objection to the military commission&#x92;s jurisdiction, and held that Hamdan&#x92;s trial before the contemplated commission would violate neither the UCMJ nor U. S. Armed Forces regulations intended to implement the Geneva Conventions.  415 F. 3d, at 38, 42&#x96;43.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On November 7, 2005, we granted certiorari to decide whether the military commission convened to try Hamdan has authority to do so, and whether Hamdan may rely on the Geneva Conventions in these proceedings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On February 13, 2006, the Government filed a motion to dismiss the writ of certiorari.  The ground cited for dismissal was the recently enacted Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), Pub. L. 109&#x96;148, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2739.  We postponed our ruling on that motion pending argument on the merits, 546 U. S. ___ (2006), and now deny it.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The DTA, which was signed into law on December 30, 2005, addresses a broad swath of subjects related to detainees.  It places restrictions on the treatment and interrogation of detainees in U. S. custody, and it furnishes procedural protections for U. S. personnel accused of engaging in improper interrogation.  DTA &#xA7;&#xA7;1002&#x96;1004, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2739&#x96;2740.  It also sets forth certain &#x93;<span class="smallcaps">procedures for status review of detainees outside the United States</span>.&#x94;  &#xA7;1005, <em>id.</em>, at 2740.  Subsections (a) through (d) of &#xA7;1005 direct the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the procedures being used by CSRTs to determine the proper classification of detainees held in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and to adopt certain safeguards as part of those procedures.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Subsection (e) of &#xA7;1005, which is entitled &#x93;<span class="smallcaps">Judicial Review of Detention of Enemy Combatants</span>,&#x94; supplies the basis for the Government&#x92;s jurisdictional argument.  The subsection contains three numbered paragraphs.  The first paragraph amends the judicial code as follows:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(1)<span class="smallcaps">In general</span>.&#x97;Section 2241 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93; &#x91;(e)Except as provided in section 1005 of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider&#x97;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93; &#x91;(1)an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; or</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93; &#x91;(2)any other action against the United States or its agents relating to any aspect of the detention by the Department of Defense of an alien at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who&#x97;</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Paragraph (2) of subsection (e) vests in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit the &#x93;exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of any final decision of a [CSRT] that an alien is properly designated as an enemy combatant.&#x94;  Paragraph (2) also delimits the scope of that review.  See &#xA7;&#xA7;1005(e)(2)(C)(i)&#x96;(ii), <em>id.</em>, at 2742.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Paragraph (3) mirrors paragraph (2) in structure, but governs judicial review of final decisions of military commissions, not CSRTs.  It vests in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit &#x93;exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of any final decision rendered pursuant to Military Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).&#x94;  &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(A), <em>id.</em>, at 2743.<a name="ZO-2ref" href="#ZO-2" class="">

            </a>  Review is as of right for any alien sentenced to death or a term of imprisonment of 10 years or more, but is at the Court of Appeals&#x92; discretion in all other cases.  The scope of review is limited to the following inquiries:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(i)whether the final decision [of the military commission] was consistent with the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (A); and</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, &#xA7;1005 contains an &#x93;effective date&#x94; provision, which reads as follows:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(1)<span class="smallcaps">In general</span>.&#x97;This section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(2)<span class="smallcaps">Review of Combatant Status Tribunal and Military Commission Decisions</span>.&#x97;Paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (e) shall apply with respect to any claim whose review is governed by one of such paragraphs and that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.&#x94;  &#xA7;1005(h), <em>id.</em>, at 2743&#x96;2744.<a name="ZO-3ref" href="#ZO-3" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The Act is silent about whether paragraph (1) of subsection (e) &#x93;shall apply&#x94; to claims pending on the date of enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government argues that &#xA7;&#xA7;1005(e)(1) and 1005(h) had the immediate effect, upon enactment, of repealing federal jurisdiction not just over detainee habeas actions yet to be filed but also over any such actions then pending in any federal court&#x97;including this Court.  Accordingly, it argues, we lack jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision below.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan objects to this theory on both constitutional and statutory grounds.  Principal among his constitutional arguments is that the Government&#x92;s preferred reading raises grave questions about Congress&#x92; authority to impinge upon this Court&#x92;s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases.  Support for this argument is drawn from <em>Ex parte Yerger,</em>8Wall.
85 (1869), in which, having explained that &#x93;the denial to this court of appellate jurisdiction&#x94; to consider an original writ of habeas corpus would &#x93;greatly weaken the efficacy of the writ,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 102&#x96;103, we held that Congress would not be presumed to have effected such denial absent an unmistakably clear statement to the contrary.  See <em>id.</em>, at 104&#x96;105; see also <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/518/651" class="subref" title="subref">518 U. S. 651</a> (1996)

                </sup>
            </a> could not have been &#x93;a plainer instance of positive exception&#x94;).  Hamdan also suggests that, if the Government&#x92;s reading is correct, Congress has unconstitutionally suspended the writ of habeas corpus.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We find it unnecessary to reach either of these arguments.  Ordinary principles of statutory construction suffice to rebut the Government&#x92;s theory&#x97;at least insofar as this case, which was pending at the time the DTA was enacted, is concerned.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government acknowledges that only paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (e) are expressly made applicable to pending cases, see &#xA7;1005(h)(2), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743&#x96;2744, but argues that the omission of paragraph (1) from the scope of that express statement is of no moment.  This is so, we are told, because Congress&#x92; failure to expressly reserve federal courts&#x92; jurisdiction over pending cases erects a presumption against jurisdiction, and that presumption is rebutted by neither the text nor the legislative history of the DTA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first part of this argument is not entirely without support in our precedents.  We have in the past &#x93;applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products,</em>

            </a>  If a statutory provision &#x93;would operate retroactively&#x94; as applied to cases pending at the time the provision was enacted, then &#x93;our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 280.  We have explained, however, that, unlike other intervening changes in the law, a jurisdiction-conferring or jurisdiction-stripping statute usually &#x93;takes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case.&#x94;  <em>Hallowell</em>, 239 U. S., at 508.  If that is truly all the statute does, no retroactivity problem arises because the change in the law does not &#x93;impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party&#x92;s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U.

            </a>  A familiar principle of statutory construction, relevant both in <em>Lindh</em> and here, is that a negative inference may be drawn from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute.

 (&#x93; &#x91;[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion&#x92; &#x94;).  The Court in <em>Lindh</em> relied on this reasoning to conclude that certain limitations on the availability of habeas relief imposed by AEDPA applied only to cases filed after that statute&#x92;s effective date.  Congress&#x92; failure to identify the temporal reach of those limitations, which governed noncapital cases, stood in contrast to its express command in the same legislation that new rules governing habeas petitions in capital cases &#x93;apply to cases pending on or after the date of enactment.&#x94;  &#xA7;107(c),

        <p class="bodytext">    A like inference follows <em>a fortiori </em>from <em>Lindh</em> in this case.  &#x93;If &#x2026; Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure that [&#xA7;&#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)] be applied to pending cases, it should have been just as concerned about [&#xA7;1005(e)(1)], unless it had the different intent that the latter [section] not be applied to the general run of pending cases.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  If anything, the evidence of deliberate omission is stronger here than it was in <em>Lindh</em>.  In <em>Lindh</em>, the provisions to be contrasted had been drafted separately but were later &#x93;joined together and &#x2026; considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 330.

 (&#x93;The more apparently deliberate the contrast, the stronger the inference, as applied, for example, to contrasting statutory sections originally enacted simultaneously in relevant respects&#x94;).  Here, Congress not only considered the respective temporal reaches of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (e) together at every stage, but omitted paragraph (1) from its directive that paragraphs (2) and (3) apply to pending cases only after having <em>rejected</em> earlier proposed versions of the statute that would have included what is now paragraph (1) within the scope of that directive.

        <p class="bodytext">    The Government nonetheless offers two reasons why, in its view, no negative inference may be drawn in favor of jurisdiction.  First, it asserts that <em>Lindh</em> is inapposite because &#x93;Section 1005(e)(1) and (h)(1) remove jurisdiction, while Section 1005(e)(2), (3) and (h)(2) create an exclusive review mechanism and define the nature of that review.&#x94;  Reply Brief in Support of Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss 4.

, the Government argues, Congress&#x92; different treatment of them is of no significance.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This argument must fail because it rests on a false distinction between the &#x93;jurisdictional&#x94; nature of subsection (e)(1) and the &#x93;procedural&#x94; character of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3).  In truth, all three provisions govern jurisdiction over detainees&#x92; claims; subsection (e)(1) addresses jurisdiction in habeas cases and other actions &#x93;relating to any aspect of the detention,&#x94; while subsections (e)(2) and (3) vest exclusive,<a name="ZO-11ref" href="#ZO-11" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    That subsection (e)(1) strips jurisdiction while subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) restore it in limited form is hardly a distinction upon which a negative inference must founder.  <span class="smallcaps">Justice Scalia</span>, in arguing to the contrary, maintains that Congress had &#x93;ample reason&#x94; to provide explicitly for application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) to pending cases because &#x93;jurisdiction-stripping&#x94; provisions like subsection (e)(1) have been treated differently under our retroactivity jurisprudence than &#x93;jurisdiction-conferring&#x94; ones like subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3).  <em>Post</em>, at 8 (dissenting opinion); see also Reply Brief in Support of Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss 5&#x96;6.

            </a>  Moreover, it strains credulity to suggest that the desire to reinforce the application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) to pending cases drove Congress to <em>exclude</em> subsection (e)(1) from &#xA7;1005(h)(2).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government&#x92;s second objection is that applying subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) but not (e)(1) to pending cases &#x93;produces an absurd result&#x94; because it grants (albeit only temporarily) dual jurisdiction over detainees&#x92; cases in circumstances where the statute plainly envisions that the District of Columbia Circuit will have &#x93;<em>exclusive</em>&#x94; and immediate jurisdiction over such cases.  Reply Brief in Support of Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss 7.  But the premise here is faulty; subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) grant jurisdiction only over actions to &#x93;determine the validity of any final decision&#x94; of a CSRT or commission.  Because Hamdan, at least, is not contesting any &#x93;final decision&#x94; of a CSRT or military commission, his action does not fall within the scope of subsection (e)(2) or (e)(3).  There is, then, no absurdity.<a name="ZO-14ref" href="#ZO-14" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The Government&#x92;s more general suggestion that Congress can have had no good reason for preserving habeas jurisdiction over cases that had been brought by detainees prior to enactment of the DTA not only is belied by the legislative history, see n. 10, <em>supra</em>, but is otherwise without merit.  There is nothing absurd about a scheme under which pending habeas actions&#x97;particularly those, like this one, that challenge the very legitimacy of the tribunals whose judgments Congress would like to have reviewed&#x97;are preserved, and more routine challenges to final decisions rendered by those tribunals are carefully channeled to a particular court and through a particular lens of review.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, we cannot leave unaddressed <span class="smallcaps">Justice Scalia</span>&#x92;s contentions that the &#x93;meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear,&#x94; <em>post</em>, at 6, and that &#x93;the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed,&#x94; <em>post</em>, at 3 (emphasis in original).  Only by treating the <em>Bruner</em> rule as an inflexible trump (a thing it has never been, see n. 7, <em>supra</em>) and ignoring both the rest of &#xA7;1005&#x92;s text and its drafting history can one conclude as much.  Congress here expressly provided that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applied to pending cases.  It chose not to so provide&#x97;after having been presented with the option&#x97;for subsection (e)(1).  The omission is an integral part of the statutory scheme that muddies whatever &#x93;plain meaning&#x94; may be discerned from blinkered study of subsection (e)(1) alone.  The dissent&#x92;s speculation about what Congress might have intended by the omission not only is counterfactual, cf. n. 10, <em>supra</em> (recounting legislative history), but rests on both a misconstruction of the DTA and an erroneous view our precedents, see <em>supra</em>, at 17, and n. 12.</p>

Objecting that the alleged offenses were not &#x93; &#x91;service connected,&#x92; &#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 740, the officer filed suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the proceedings.  He neither questioned the lawfulness of courts-martial or their procedures nor disputed that, as a serviceman, he was subject to court-martial jurisdiction.

First, military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts.  See <em>Councilman</em>, 420 U. S., at 752.  Second, federal courts should respect the balance that Congress struck between military preparedness and fairness to individual service members when it created &#x93;an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals, consisting of civilian judges &#x91;completely removed from all military influence or persuasion &#x2026; .&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 758 (quoting H.

First, Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.  Second, the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.  Unlike the officer in <em>Councilman</em>,<em/>Hamdan has no right to appeal any conviction to the civilian judges of the Court of Military Appeals (now called the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, see Pub.

Instead, under Dept. of Defense Military Commission Order No. 1 (Commission Order No. 1), which was issued by the President on March 21, 2002, and amended most recently on August 31, 2005, and which governs the procedures for Hamdan&#x92;s commission, any conviction would be reviewed by a panel consisting of three military officers designated by the Secretary of Defense.

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, neither of the two comity considerations underlying our decision to abstain in <em>Councilman</em> applies to the circumstances of this case.  Instead, this Court&#x92;s decision in <em>Quirin</em> is the most relevant precedent.  In <em>Quirin</em>, seven German saboteurs were captured upon arrival by submarine in New York and Florida.  317 U. S., at 21.  The President convened a military commission to try the saboteurs, who then filed habeas corpus petitions in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging their trial by commission.  We granted the saboteurs&#x92; petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals before judgment.  See <em>id.</em>, at 19.  Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.  That course of action was warranted, we explained, &#x93;[i]n view of the public importance of the questions raised by [the cases] and of the duty which rests on the courts, in time of war as well as in time of peace, to preserve unimpaired the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty, and because in our opinion the public interest required that we consider and decide those questions without any avoidable delay.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the Government has identified no other &#x93;important countervailing interest&#x94; that would permit federal courts to depart from their general &#x93;duty to exercise the jurisdiction that is conferred upon them by Congress.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 716 (majority opinion).  To the contrary, Hamdan and the Government both have a compelling interest in knowing in advance whether Hamdan may be tried by a military commission that arguably is without any basis in law and operates free from many of the procedural rules prescribed by Congress for courts-martial&#x97;rules intended to safeguard the accused and ensure the reliability of any conviction.  While we certainly do not foreclose the possibility that abstention may be appropriate in some cases seeking review of ongoing military commission proceedings (such as military commissions convened on the battlefield), the foregoing discussion makes clear that, under our precedent, abstention is not justified here.  We therefore proceed to consider the merits of Hamdan&#x92;s challenge.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    The military commission, a tribunal neither mentioned in the Constitution nor created by statute, was born of military necessity.  See W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 831 (rev. 2d ed. 1920) (hereinafter Winthrop).  Though foreshadowed in some respects by earlier tribunals like the Board of General Officers that General Washington convened to try British Major John Andr&#xE9; for spying during the Revolutionary War, the commission &#x93;as such&#x94; was inaugurated in 1847.  <em>Id.</em>, at 832; G. Davis, A Treatise on the Military Law of the United States 308 (2d ed. 1909) (hereinafter Davis).  As commander of occupied Mexican territory, and having available to him no other tribunal, General Winfield Scott that year ordered the establishment of both &#x93; &#x91;<em>military commissions</em>&#x92; &#x94; to try ordinary crimes committed in the occupied territory and a &#x93;<em>council of war</em>&#x94; to try offenses against the law of war.  Winthrop 832 (emphases in original).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When the exigencies of war next gave rise to a need for use of military commissions, during the Civil War, the dual system favored by General Scott was not adopted.  Instead, a single tribunal often took jurisdiction over ordinary crimes, war crimes, and breaches of military orders alike.  As further discussed below, each aspect of that seemingly broad jurisdiction was in fact supported by a separate military exigency.  Generally, though, the need for military commissions during this period&#x97;as during the Mexican War&#x97;was driven largely by the then very limited jurisdiction of courts-martial: &#x93;The <em>occasion</em> for the military commission arises principally from the fact that the jurisdiction of the court-martial proper, in our law, is restricted by statute almost exclusively to members of the military force and to certain specific offences defined in a written code.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 831 (emphasis in original).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Exigency alone, of course, will not justify the establishment and use of penal tribunals not contemplated by Article I, &#xA7;8 and Article III, &#xA7;1 of the Constitution unless some other part of that document authorizes a response to the felt need.

Congress cannot direct the conduct of campaigns, nor can the President, or any commander under him, without the sanction of Congress, institute tribunals for the trial and punishment of offences, either of soldiers or civilians, unless in cases of a controlling necessity, which justifies what it compels, or at least insures acts of indemnity from the justice of the legislature.&#x94;  4 Wall., at 139&#x96;140.<a name="ZO-21ref" href="#ZO-21" class="">

For we held in <em>Quirin </em>that Congress had, through Article of War 15, sanctioned the use of military commissions in such circumstances.  317 U.

Contrary to the Government&#x92;s assertion, however, even <em>Quirin</em> did not view the authorization as a sweeping mandate for the President to &#x93;invoke military commissions when he deems them necessary.&#x94;  Brief for Respondents 17.  Rather, the <em>Quirin</em> Court recognized that Congress had simply preserved what power, under the Constitution and the common law of war, the President had had before 1916 to convene military commissions&#x97;with the express condition that the President and those under his command comply with the law of war.

        <p class="bodytext">The Government would have us dispense with the inquiry that the Quirin Court undertook and find in either the AUMF or the DTA specific, overriding authorization for the very commission that has been convened to try Hamdan.  Neither of these congressional Acts, however, expands the President&#x92;s authority to convene military commissions.  First, while we assume that the AUMF activated the President&#x92;s war powers, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>,<em/>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/507" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 507</a> (2004)

S., at 11, there is nothing in the text or legislative history of the AUMF even hinting that Congress intended to expand or alter the authorization set forth in Article 21 of the UCMJ.

        <p class="bodytext">    Likewise, the DTA cannot be read to authorize this commission.  Although the DTA, unlike either Article 21 or the AUMF, was enacted after the President had convened Hamdan&#x92;s commission, it contains no language authorizing that tribunal or any other at Guantanamo Bay.  The DTA obviously &#x93;recognize[s]&#x94; the existence of the Guantanamo Bay commissions in the weakest sense, Brief for Respondents 15, because it references some of the military orders governing them and creates limited judicial review of their &#x93;final decision[s],&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3),

But the statute also pointedly reserves judgment on whether &#x93;the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable&#x94; in reviewing such decisions and whether, if they are, the &#x93;standards and procedures&#x94; used to try Hamdan and other detainees actually violate the &#x93;Constitution and laws.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Together, the UCMJ, the AUMF, and the DTA at most acknowledge a general Presidential authority to convene military commissions in circumstances where justified under the &#x93;Constitution and laws,&#x94; including the law of war.  Absent a more specific congressional authorization, the task of this Court is, as it was in Quirin, to decide whether Hamdan&#x92;s military commission is so justified.

            <em>Quirin</em> is the model the Government invokes most frequently to defend the commission convened to try Hamdan.  That is both appropriate and unsurprising.  Since Guantanamo Bay is neither enemy-occupied territory nor under martial law, the law-of-war commission is the only model available.  At the same time, no more robust model of executive power exists; <em>Quirin</em> represents the high-water mark of military power to try enemy combatants for war crimes.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The classic treatise penned by Colonel William Winthrop, whom we have called &#x93;the &#x91;Blackstone of Military Law,&#x92; &#x94; <em>Reid</em> v. <em>Covert,</em>

First, &#x93;[a] military commission, (except where otherwise authorized by statute), can legally assume jurisdiction only of offenses committed within the field of the command of the convening commander.&#x94;  Winthrop 836.  The &#x93;field of command&#x94; in these circumstances means the &#x93;theatre of war.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Second, the offense charged &#x93;must have been committed within the period of the war.&#x94;<a name="ZO-28ref" href="#ZO-28" class="">

Finally, a law-of-war commission has jurisdiction to try only two kinds of offense: &#x93;Violations of the laws and usages of war cognizable by military tribunals only,&#x94; and &#x93;[b]reaches of military orders or regulations for which offenders are not legally triable by court-martial under the Articles of war.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 839.<a name="ZO-29ref" href="#ZO-29" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    All parties agree that Colonel Winthrop&#x92;s treatise accurately describes the common law governing military commissions, and that the jurisdictional limitations he identifies were incorporated in Article of War 15 and, later, Article 21 of the UCMJ.  It also is undisputed that Hamdan&#x92;s commission lacks jurisdiction to try him unless the charge &#x93;properly set[s] forth, not only the details of the act charged, but the circumstances conferring <em>jurisdiction</em>.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 842 (emphasis in original).

But the deficiencies in the time and place allegations also underscore&#x97;indeed are symptomatic of&#x97;the most serious defect of this charge: The offense it alleges is not triable by law-of-war military commission.  See <em>Yamashita</em>, 327 U.

            </a>  Winthrop explains that under the common law governing military commissions, it is not enough to intend to violate the law of war and commit overt acts in furtherance of that intention unless the overt acts either are themselves offenses against the law of war or constitute steps sufficiently substantial to qualify as an attempt.  See Winthrop 841 (&#x93;[T]he jurisdiction of the military commission should be restricted to cases of offence consisting in <em>overt acts</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, in unlawful commissions or actual attempts to commit, and not in intentions merely&#x94; (emphasis in original)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government cites three sources that it says show otherwise.  First, it points out that the Nazi saboteurs in <em>Quirin</em> were charged with conspiracy.  See Brief for Respondents 27.  Second, it observes that Winthrop at one point in his treatise identifies conspiracy as an offense &#x93;prosecuted by military commissions.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing Winthrop 839, and n. 5).  Finally, it notes that another military historian, Charles Roscoe Howland, lists conspiracy &#x93; &#x91;to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the enemy&#x92; &#x94; as an offense that was tried as a violation of the law of war during the Civil War.  Brief for Respondents 27&#x96;28 (citing C. Howland, Digest of Opinions of the Judge Advocates General of the Army 1071 (1912) (hereinafter Howland)).  On close analysis, however, these sources at best lend little support to the Government&#x92;s position and at worst undermine it.  By any measure, they fail to satisfy the high standard of clarity required to justify the use of a military commission.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    That the defendants in <em>Quirin</em> were charged with conspiracy is not persuasive, since the Court declined to address whether the offense actually qualified as a violation of the law of war&#x97;let alone one triable by military commission.  The <em>Quirin</em> defendants were charged with the following offenses:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;[I.]Violation of the law of war.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

&#x93;[II.]Violation of Article 81 of the Articles of War, defining the offense of relieving or attempting to relieve, or corresponding with or giving intelligence to, the enemy.</p>

&#x93;[IV.]Conspiracy to commit the offenses alleged in charges [I, II, and III].&#x94;  317 U. S., at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The Government, defending its charge, argued that the conspiracy alleged &#x93;constitute[d] an additional violation of the law of war.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  The saboteurs disagreed; they maintained that &#x93;[t]he charge of conspiracy can not stand if the other charges fall.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 8.  The Court, however, declined to resolve the dispute.  It concluded, first, that the specification supporting Charge I adequately alleged a &#x93;violation of the law of war&#x94; that was not &#x93;merely colorable or without foundation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 36.  The facts the Court deemed sufficient for this purpose were that the defendants, admitted enemy combatants, entered upon U. S. territory in time of war without uniform &#x93;for the purpose of destroying property used or useful in prosecuting the war.&#x94;  That act was &#x93;a hostile and warlike&#x94; one.  <em>Id.</em>, at 36, 37.  The Court was careful in its decision to identify an overt, &#x93;complete&#x94; act.  Responding to the argument that the saboteurs had &#x93;not actually committed or attempted to commit any act of depredation or entered the theatre or zone of active military operations&#x94; and therefore had not violated the law of war, the Court responded that they had actually &#x93;passed our military and naval lines and defenses or went behind those lines, in civilian dress and with hostile purpose.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 38.  &#x93;The offense was complete when with that purpose they entered&#x97;or, having so entered, they remained upon&#x97;our territory in time of war without uniform or other appropriate means of identification.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Turning to the other charges alleged, the Court explained that &#x93;[s]ince the first specification of Charge I sets forth a violation of the law of war, we have no occasion to pass on the adequacy of the second specification of Charge I, or to construe the 81st and 82nd Articles of War for the purpose of ascertaining whether the specifications under Charges II and III allege violations of those Articles or whether if so construed they are constitutional.&#x94;  Id., at 46.  No mention was made at all of Charge IV&#x97;the conspiracy charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If anything, <em>Quirin</em> supports Hamdan&#x92;s argument that conspiracy is not a violation of the law of war.  Not only did the Court pointedly omit any discussion of the conspiracy charge, but its analysis of Charge I placed special emphasis on the <em>completion</em> of an offense; it took seriously the saboteurs&#x92; argument that there can be no violation of a law of war&#x97;at least not one triable by military commission&#x97;without the actual commission of or attempt to commit a &#x93;hostile and warlike act.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 37&#x96;38.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    That limitation makes eminent sense when one considers the necessity from whence this kind of military commission grew: The need to dispense swift justice, often in the form of execution, to illegal belligerents captured on the battlefield.  See S. Rep. No. 130, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 40 (1916) (testimony of Brig. Gen. Enoch H. Crowder) (observing that Article of War 15 preserves the power of &#x93;the military commander <em>in the field in time of war</em>&#x94; to use military commissions (emphasis added)).  The same urgency would not have been felt vis-&amp;Agrave;-vis enemies who had done little more than agree to violate the laws of war.  Cf. 
31Op. Atty. Gen.
356,
357,
361 (1918) (opining that a German spy could not be tried by military commission because, having been apprehended before entering &#x93;any camp, fortification or other military premises of the United States,&#x94; he had &#x93;committed [his offenses] outside of the field of military operations&#x94;).  The <em>Quirin</em> Court acknowledged as much when it described the President&#x92;s authority to use law-of-war military commissions as the power to &#x93;seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies <em>who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort</em> have violated the law of war.&#x94;  317 U. S., at 28&#x96;29 (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Winthrop and Howland are only superficially more helpful to the Government.  Howland, granted, lists &#x93;conspiracy by two or more to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the enemy&#x94; as one of over 20 &#x93;offenses against the laws and usages of war&#x94; &#x93;passed upon and punished by military commissions.&#x94;  Howland 1071.  But while the records of cases that Howland cites following his list of offenses against the law of war support inclusion of the other offenses mentioned, they provide no support for the inclusion of conspiracy as a violation of the law of war.  See <em>ibid.</em> (citing Record Books of the Judge Advocate General Office, R. 2, 144; R. 3, 401, 589, 649; R. 4, 320; R. 5, 36, 590; R. 6, 20; R. 7, 413; R. 8, 529; R. 9, 149, 202, 225, 481, 524, 535; R. 10, 567; R. 11, 473, 513; R. 13, 125, 675; R. 16, 446; R. 21, 101, 280).  Winthrop, apparently recognizing as much, excludes conspiracy of any kind from his own list of offenses against the law of war.  See Winthrop 839&#x96;840.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Winthrop does, unsurprisingly, include &#x93;criminal conspiracies&#x94; in his list of &#x93;[c]rimes and statutory offenses cognizable by State or U. S. courts&#x94; and triable by martial law or military government commission.  See <em>id.</em>, at 839.  And, in a footnote, he cites several Civil War examples of &#x93;conspiracies of this class, <em>or of the first and second classes combined</em>.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 839, n. 5 (emphasis added).  The Government relies on this footnote for its contention that conspiracy was triable both as an ordinary crime (a crime of the &#x93;first class&#x94;) and, independently, as a war crime (a crime of the &#x93;second class&#x94;).  But the footnote will not support the weight the Government places on it.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As we have seen, the military commissions convened during the Civil War functioned at once as martial law or military government tribunals and as law-of-war commissions.  See n. 27, <em>supra</em>.  Accordingly, they regularly tried war crimes and ordinary crimes together.  Indeed, as Howland observes, &#x93;[n]ot infrequently the crime, as charged and found, was a combination of the two species of offenses.&#x94;  Howland 1071; see also Davis 310, n. 2; Winthrop 842.  The example he gives is &#x93; &#x91;murder in violation of the laws of war.&#x92; &#x94;  Howland 1071&#x96;1072.  Winthrop&#x92;s conspiracy &#x93;of the first and second classes combined&#x94; is, like Howland&#x92;s example, best understood as a species of compound offense of the type tried by the hybrid military commissions of the Civil War.  It is not a stand-alone offense against the law of war.  Winthrop confirms this understanding later in his discussion, when he emphasizes that &#x93;<em>overt acts</em>&#x94; constituting war crimes are the only proper subject at least of those military tribunals not convened to stand in for local courts.  Winthrop 841, and nn. 22, 23 (emphasis in original) (citing W. Finlason, Martial Law 130 (1867)).</p>

            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Thomas</span> cites as evidence that conspiracy is a recognized violation of the law of war the Civil War indictment against Henry Wirz, which charged the defendant  with &#x93; &#x91;[m]aliciously, willfully, and traitorously &#x2026; combining, confederating, and conspiring [with others] to injure the health and destroy the lives of soldiers in the military service of the United States &#x2026; to the end that the armies of the United States might be weakened and impaired, in violation of the laws and customs of war.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Post</em>, at 24&#x96;25 (dissenting opinion) (quoting H.

As shown by the specification supporting that charge, however, Wirz was alleged to have <em>personally committed</em> a number of atrocities against his victims, including torture, injection of prisoners with poison, and use of &#x93;ferocious and bloodthirsty dogs&#x94; to &#x93;seize, tear, mangle, and maim the bodies and limbs&#x94; of prisoners, many of whom died as a result.  <em>Id.</em>, at 789&#x96;790.  Crucially, Judge Advocate General Holt determined that one of Wirz&#x92;s alleged co-conspirators, R. B. Winder, should <em>not</em> be tried by military commission because there was as yet insufficient evidence of his own personal involvement in the atrocities: &#x93;[I]n the case of R. B. Winder, <em>while the evidence at the trial of Wirz was deemed by the court to implicate him in the conspiracy</em> against the lives of all Federal prisoners in rebel hands, <em>no such specific overt acts of violation of the laws of war</em> are as yet fixed upon him as to make it expedient to prefer formal charges and bring him to trial.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 783 (emphases added).<a name="ZO-37ref" href="#ZO-37" class="">

As one prominent figure from the Nuremberg trials has explained, members of the Tribunal objected to recognition of conspiracy as a violation of the law of war on the ground that &#x93;[t]he Anglo-American concept of conspiracy was not part of European legal systems and arguably not an element of the internationally recognized laws of war.&#x94;  T.

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, the sources that the Government and <span class="smallcaps">Justice Thomas</span> rely upon to show that conspiracy to violate the law of war is itself a violation of the law of war in fact demonstrate quite the opposite.  Far from making the requisite substantial showing, the Government has failed even to offer a &#x93;merely colorable&#x94; case for inclusion of conspiracy among those offenses cognizable by law-of-war military commission.  Cf. <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 36.  Because the charge does not support the commission&#x92;s jurisdiction, the commission lacks authority to try Hamdan.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The charge&#x92;s shortcomings are not merely formal, but are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition&#x97;at least in the absence of specific congressional authorization&#x97;for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.  Hamdan&#x92;s tribunal was appointed not by a military commander in the field of battle, but by a retired major general stationed away from any active hostilities.  Cf. <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush, </em>542 U. S., at 487 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy, J.</span>, concurring in judgment) (observing that &#x93;Guantanamo Bay is &#x2026; far removed from any hostilities&#x94;).  Hamdan is charged not with an overt act for which he was caught redhanded in a theater of war and which military efficiency demands be tried expeditiously, but with an <em>agreement</em> the inception of which long predated the attacks of September 11, 2001 and the AUMF.  That may well be a crime,<a name="ZO-41ref" href="#ZO-41" class="">

            </a> but it is not an offense that &#x93;by the law of war may be tried by military commissio[n].&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/821.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;821</a>.  None of the overt acts alleged to have been committed in furtherance of the agreement is itself a war crime, or even necessarily occurred during time of, or in a theater of, war.  Any urgent need for imposition or execution of judgment is utterly belied by the record; Hamdan was arrested in November 2001 and he was not charged until mid-2004.  These simply are not the circumstances in which, by any stretch of the historical evidence or this Court&#x92;s precedents, a military commission established by Executive Order under the authority of Article 21 of the UCMJ may lawfully try a person and subject him to punishment.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">VI</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Whether or not the Government has charged Hamdan with an offense against the law of war cognizable by military commission, the commission lacks power to proceed.  The UCMJ conditions the President&#x92;s use of military commissions on compliance not only with the American common law of war, but also with the rest of the UCMJ itself, insofar as applicable, and with the &#x93;rules and precepts of the law of nations,&#x94; <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 28&#x97;including, <em>inter alia</em>, the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.  See <em>Yamashita</em>, 327 U. S., at 20&#x96;21, 23&#x96;24.  The procedures that the Government has decreed will govern Hamdan&#x92;s trial by commission violate these laws.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The commission&#x92;s procedures are set forth in Commission Order No. 1, which was amended most recently on </p>
        <p class="bodytext">August 31, 2005&#x97;after Hamdan&#x92;s trial had already begun.  Every commission established pursuant to Commission Order No. 1 must have a presiding officer and at least three other members, all of whom must be commissioned officers.  &#xA7;4(A)(1).  The presiding officer&#x92;s job is to rule on questions of law and other evidentiary and interlocutory issues; the other members make findings and, if applicable, sentencing decisions.  &#xA7;4(A)(5).  The accused is entitled to appointed military counsel and may hire civilian counsel at his own expense so long as such counsel is a U. S. citizen with security clearance &#x93;at the level SECRET or higher.&#x94;  &#xA7;&#xA7;4(C)(2)&#x96;(3).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The accused also is entitled to a copy of the charge(s) against him, both in English and his own language (if different), to a presumption of innocence, and to certain other rights typically afforded criminal defendants in civilian courts and courts-martial.  See &#xA7;&#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P).  These rights are subject, however, to one glaring condition: The accused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from, and precluded from ever learning what evidence was presented during, any part of the proceeding that either the Appointing Authority or the presiding officer decides to &#x93;close.&#x94;  Grounds for such closure &#x93;include the protection of information classified or classifiable &#x2026; ; information protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure; the physical safety of participants in Commission proceedings, including prospective witnesses; intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or activities; and other national security interests.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(B)(3).<a name="ZO-42ref" href="#ZO-42" class="">

            </a>  Appointed military defense counsel must be privy to these closed sessions, but may, at the presiding officer&#x92;s discretion, be forbidden to reveal to his or her client what took place therein.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Another striking feature of the rules governing Hamdan&#x92;s commission is that they permit the admission of any evidence that, in the opinion of the presiding officer, &#x93;would have probative value to a reasonable person.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(D)(1).  Under this test, not only is testimonial hearsay and evidence obtained through coercion fully admissible, but neither live testimony nor witnesses&#x92; written statements need be sworn.  See &#xA7;&#xA7;6(D)(2)(b), (3).  Moreover, the accused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to evidence in the form of &#x93;protected information&#x94; (which includes classified information as well as &#x93;information protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure&#x94; and &#x93;information concerning other national security interests,&#x94; &#xA7;&#xA7;6(B)(3), 6(D)(5)(a)(v)), so long as the presiding officer concludes that the evidence is &#x93;probative&#x94; under &#xA7;6(D)(1) and that its admission without the accused&#x92;s knowledge would not &#x93;result in the denial of a full and fair trial.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(D)(5)(b).<a name="ZO-43ref" href="#ZO-43" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>43</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  Finally, a presiding officer&#x92;s determination that evidence &#x93;would not have probative value to a reasonable person&#x94; may be overridden by a majority of the other commission members.  &#xA7;6(D)(1).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Once all the evidence is in, the commission members (not including the presiding officer) must vote on the accused&#x92;s guilt.  A two-thirds vote will suffice for both a verdict of guilty and for imposition of any sentence not including death (the imposition of which requires a unanimous vote).  &#xA7;6(F).  Any appeal is taken to a three-member review panel composed of military officers and designated by the Secretary of Defense, only one member of which need have experience as a judge.  &#xA7;6(H)(4).  The review panel is directed to &#x93;disregard any variance from procedures specified in this Order or elsewhere that would not materially have affected the outcome of the trial before the Commission.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Once the panel makes its recommendation to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary can either remand for further proceedings or forward the record to the President with his recommendation as to final disposition.  &#xA7;6(H)(5).  The President then, unless he has delegated the task to the Secretary, makes the &#x93;final decision.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(H)(6).  He may change the commission&#x92;s findings or sentence only in a manner favorable to the accused.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan raises both general and particular objections to the procedures set forth in Commission Order No. 1.  His general objection is that the procedures&#x92; admitted deviation from those governing courts-martial itself renders the commission illegal.  Chief among his particular objections are that he may, under the Commission Order, be convicted based on evidence he has not seen or heard, and that any evidence admitted against him need not comply with the admissibility or relevance rules typically applicable in criminal trials and court-martial proceedings.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government objects to our consideration of any procedural challenge at this stage on the grounds that (1) the abstention doctrine espoused in <em>Councilman</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a>, precludes pre-enforcement review of procedural rules, (2) Hamdan will be able to raise any such challenge following a &#x93;final decision&#x94; under the DTA, and (3) &#x93;there is &#x2026; no basis to presume, before the trial has even commenced, that the trial will not be conducted in good faith and according to law.&#x94;  Brief for Respondents 45&#x96;46, nn. 20&#x96;21.  The first of these contentions was disposed of in Part III, <em>supra</em>, and neither of the latter two is sound.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, because Hamdan apparently is not subject to the death penalty (at least as matters now stand) and may receive a sentence shorter than 10 years&#x92; imprisonment, he has no automatic right to review of the commission&#x92;s &#x93;final decision&#x94;<a name="ZO-44ref" href="#ZO-44" class="">

2743.  Second, contrary to the Government&#x92;s assertion, there <em>is</em> a &#x93;basis to presume&#x94; that the procedures employed during Hamdan&#x92;s trial will violate the law: The procedures are described with particularity in Commission Order No. 1, and implementation of some of them has already occurred.  One of Hamdan&#x92;s complaints is that he will be, and <em>indeed already has been</em>, excluded from his own trial.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 12; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a.  Under these circumstances, review of the procedures in advance of a &#x93;final decision&#x94;&#x97;the timing of which is left entirely to the discretion of the President under the DTA&#x97;is appropriate.  We turn, then, to consider the merits of Hamdan&#x92;s procedural challenge.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In part because the difference between military commissions and courts-martial originally was a difference of jurisdiction alone, and in part to protect against abuse and ensure evenhandedness under the pressures of war, the procedures governing trials by military commission historically have been the same as those governing courts-martial.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 1 The War of the Rebellion 248 (2d series 1894) (General Order 1 issued during the Civil War required military commissions to &#x93;be constituted in a similar manner and their proceedings be conducted according to the same general rules as courts-martial in order to prevent abuses which might otherwise arise&#x94;).  Accounts of commentators from Winthrop through General Crowder&#x97;who drafted Article of War 15 and whose views have been deemed &#x93;authoritative&#x94; by this Court, <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 353&#x97;confirm as much.<a name="ZO-45ref" href="#ZO-45" class="">

            </a>  As recently as the Korean and Vietnam wars, during which use of military commissions was contemplated but never made, the principle of procedural parity was espoused as a background assumption.  See Paust, Antiterrorism Military Commissions: Courting Illegality, 23 Mich. J. Int&#x92;l L. 1, 3&#x96;5 (2001&#x96;2002).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There is a glaring historical exception to this general rule.  The procedures and evidentiary rules used to try General Yamashita near the end of World War II deviated in significant respects from those then governing courts-martial.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/1" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 1</a>.  The force of that precedent, however, has been seriously undermined by post-World War II developments.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Yamashita, from late 1944 until September 1945, was Commanding General of the Fourteenth Army Group of the Imperial Japanese Army, which had exercised control over the Philippine Islands.  On September 3, 1945, after American forces regained control of the Philippines, Yamashita surrendered.  Three weeks later, he was charged with violations of the law of war.  A few weeks after that, he was arraigned before a military commission convened in the Philippines.  He pleaded not guilty, and his trial lasted for two months.  On December 7, 1945, Yamashita was convicted and sentenced to hang.  See <em>id.</em>, at 5; <em>id.</em>, at 31&#x96;34 (Murphy, J., dissenting).  This Court upheld the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The procedures and rules of evidence employed during Yamashita&#x92;s trial departed so far from those used in courts-martial that they generated an unusually long and vociferous critique from two Members of this Court.

            </a> Commentary: Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War 413 (1960) (hereinafter GCIII Commentary) (explaining that Article 85, which extends the Convention&#x92;s protections to &#x93;[p]risoners of war prosecuted under the laws of the Detaining Power for acts committed prior to capture,&#x94; was adopted in response to judicial interpretations of the 1929 Convention, including this Court&#x92;s decision in <em>Yamashita</em>).  The most notorious exception to the principle of uniformity, then, has been stripped of its precedential value.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The uniformity principle is not an inflexible one; it does not preclude all departures from the procedures dictated for use by courts-martial.  But any departure must be tailored to the exigency that necessitates it.  See Winthrop 835, n. 81.  That understanding is reflected in Article 36 of the UCMJ, which provides:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(a)The procedure, including modes of proof, in cases before courts-martial, courts of inquiry, military commissions, and other military tribunals may be prescribed by the President by regulations which shall, so far as he considers practicable, apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(b)All rules and regulations made under this article shall be uniform insofar as practicable and shall be reported to Congress.&#x94;  70A Stat. 50.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Article 36 places two restrictions on the President&#x92;s power to promulgate rules of procedure for courts-martial and military commissions alike.  First, no procedural rule he adopts may be &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; the UCMJ&#x97;however practical it may seem.  Second, the rules adopted must be &#x93;uniform insofar as practicable.&#x94;  That is, the rules applied to military commissions must be the same as those applied to courts-martial unless such uniformity proves impracticable.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan argues that Commission Order No. 1 violates both of these restrictions; he maintains that the procedures described in the Commission Order are inconsistent with the UCMJ and that the Government has offered no explanation for their deviation from the procedures governing courts-martial, which are set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2005 ed.) (Manual for Courts-Martial).  Among the inconsistencies Hamdan identifies is that between &#xA7;6 of the Commission Order, which permits exclusion of the accused from proceedings and denial of his access to evidence in certain circumstances, and the UCMJ&#x92;s requirement that &#x93;[a]ll &#x2026; proceedings&#x94; other than votes and deliberations by courts-martial &#x93;shall be made a part of the record and shall be in the presence of the accused.&#x94;  10  U. S. C. A. &#xA7;839(c) (Supp. 2006).  Hamdan also observes that the Commission Order dispenses with virtually all evidentiary rules applicable in courts-martial.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government has three responses.  First, it argues, only 9 of the UCMJ&#x92;s 158 Articles&#x97;the ones that expressly mention &#x93;military commissions&#x94;<a name="ZO-49ref" href="#ZO-49" class="">
                <sup>

            </a>&#x97;actually apply to commissions, and Commission Order No. 1 sets forth no procedure that is &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; those 9 provisions.  Second, the Government contends, military commissions would be of no use if the President were hamstrung by those provisions of the UCMJ that govern courts-martial.  Finally, the President&#x92;s determination that &#x93;the danger to the safety of the United States and the nature of international terrorism&#x94; renders it impracticable &#x93;to apply in military commissions &#x2026; the principles of law and rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts,&#x94; November 13 Order &#xA7;1(f), is, in the Government&#x92;s view, explanation enough for any deviation from court-martial procedures.  See Brief for Respondents 43&#x96;47, and n. 22.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan has the better of this argument.  Without reaching the question whether any provision of Commission Order No. 1 is strictly &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; other provisions of the UCMJ, we conclude that the &#x93;practicability&#x94; determination the President has made is insufficient to justify variances from the procedures governing courts-martial.  Subsection (b) of Article 36 was added after World War II, and requires a different showing of impracticability from the one required by subsection (a).  Subsection (a) requires that the rules the President promulgates for courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions alike conform to those that govern procedures in <em>Article III courts</em>, &#x93;so far as <em>he considers</em> practicable.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/836.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;836(a)</a> (emphasis added).  Subsection (b), by contrast, demands that the rules applied in courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions&#x97;whether or not they conform with the Federal Rules of Evidence&#x97;be &#x93;uniform <em>insofar as practicable</em>.&#x94;  &#xA7;836(b) (emphasis added).  Under the latter provision, then, the rules set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial must apply to military commissions unless impracticable.<a name="ZO-50ref" href="#ZO-50" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The President here has determined, pursuant to subsection (a), that it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that govern &#x93;the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts,&#x94; &#xA7;836(a), to Hamdan&#x92;s commission.  We assume that complete deference is owed that determination.  The President has not, however, made a similar official determination that it is impracticable to apply the rules for courts-martial.<a name="ZO-51ref" href="#ZO-51" class="">

                    <b>51</b>
                </sup>
            </a> And even if subsection (b)&#x92;s requirements may be satisfied without such an official determination, the requirements of that subsection are not satisfied here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the record before us demonstrates that it would be impracticable to apply court-martial rules in this case.  There is no suggestion, for example, of any logistical difficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in applying the usual principles of relevance and admissibility.  Assuming <em>arguendo</em> that the reasons articulated in the President&#x92;s Article 36(a) determination ought to be considered in evaluating the impracticability of applying court-martial rules, the only reason offered in support of that determination is the danger posed by international terrorism.<a name="ZO-52ref" href="#ZO-52" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>52</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  Without for one moment underestimating that danger, it is not evident to us why it should require, in the case of Hamdan&#x92;s trial, any variance from the rules that govern courts-martial.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The absence of any showing of impracticability is particularly disturbing when considered in light of the clear and admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamental protections afforded not just by the Manual for Courts-Martial but also by the UCMJ itself: the right to be present.  See 10  U. S. C. A. &#xA7;839(c) (Supp. 2006).  Whether or not that departure technically is &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; the terms of the UCMJ, 10  U. S. C. &#xA7;836(a), the jettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as &#x93;practicable.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Under the circumstances, then, the rules applicable in courts-martial must apply.  Since it is undisputed that Commission Order No. 1 deviates in many significant respects from those rules, it necessarily violates Article 36(b).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government&#x92;s objection that requiring compliance with the court-martial rules imposes an undue burden both ignores the plain meaning of Article 36(b) and misunderstands the purpose and the history of military commissions.  The military commission was not born of a desire to dispense a more summary form of justice than is afforded by courts-martial; it developed, rather, as a tribunal of necessity to be employed when courts-martial lacked jurisdiction over either the accused or the subject matter.  See Winthrop 831.  Exigency lent the commission its legitimacy, but did not further justify the wholesale jettisoning of procedural protections.  That history explains why the military commission&#x92;s procedures typically have been the ones used by courts-martial.  That the jurisdiction of the two tribunals today may sometimes overlap, see <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 354, does not detract from the force of this history;<a name="ZO-53ref" href="#ZO-53" class="">

                </sup>
            </a> Article 21 did not transform the military commission from a tribunal of true exigency into a more convenient adjudicatory tool.  Article 36, confirming as much, strikes a careful balance between uniform procedure and the need to accommodate exigencies that may sometimes arise in a theater of war.  That Article not having been complied with here, the rules specified for Hamdan&#x92;s trial are illegal.<a name="ZO-54ref" href="#ZO-54" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The procedures adopted to try Hamdan also violate the Geneva Conventions.  The Court of Appeals dismissed Hamdan&#x92;s Geneva Convention challenge on three independent grounds: (1) the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable; (2) Hamdan in any event is not entitled to their protections; and (3) even if he is entitled to their protections, <em>Councilman </em>abstention is appropriate.

        <p class="opcentered">i</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals relied on <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager,</em>

, to hold that Hamdan could not invoke the Geneva Conventions to challenge the Government&#x92;s plan to prosecute him in accordance with Commission Order No. 1.  <em>Eisentrager</em> involved a challenge by 21 German nationals to their 1945 convictions for war crimes by a military tribunal convened in Nanking, China, and to their subsequent imprisonment in occupied Germany.  The petitioners argued, <em>inter alia</em>, that the 1929 Geneva Convention rendered illegal some of the procedures employed during their trials, which they said deviated impermissibly from the procedures used by courts-martial to try American soldiers.  See <em>id.</em>, at 789.  We rejected that claim on the merits because the petitioners (unlike Hamdan here) had failed to identify any prejudicial disparity &#x93;between the Commission that tried [them] and those that would try an offending soldier of the American forces of like rank,&#x94; and in any event could claim no protection, under the 1929 Convention, during trials for crimes that occurred before their confinement as prisoners of war.  <em>Id.</em>, at 790.<a name="ZO-56ref" href="#ZO-56" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Buried in a footnote of the opinion, however, is this curious statement suggesting that the Court lacked power even to consider the merits of the Geneva Convention argument:</p>

2021, concluded with forty-six other countries, including the German Reich, an agreement upon the treatment to be accorded captives.  These prisoners claim to be and are entitled to its protection.  It is, however, the obvious scheme of the Agreement that responsibility for observance and enforcement of these rights is upon political and military authorities.  Rights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only through protests and intervention of protecting powers as the rights of our citizens against foreign governments are vindicated only by Presidential intervention.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 789, n. 14.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

        <p class="bodytext">    Whatever else might be said about the <em>Eisentrager</em> footnote, it does not control this case.

, they are, as the Government does not dispute, part of the law of war.  See <em>Hamdi, </em>542 U. S., at 520&#x96;521 (plurality opinion).  And compliance with the law of war is the condition upon which the authority set forth in Article 21 is granted.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">ii</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For the Court of Appeals, acknowledgment of that condition was no bar to Hamdan&#x92;s trial by commission.  As an alternative to its holding that Hamdan could not invoke the Geneva Conventions at all, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Conventions did not in any event apply to the armed conflict during which Hamdan was captured.  The court accepted the Executive&#x92;s assertions that Hamdan was captured in connection with the United States&#x92; war with al Qaeda and that that war is distinct from the war with the Taliban in Afghanistan.  It further reasoned that the war with al Qaeda evades the reach of the Geneva Conventions.  See 415 F. 3d, at 41&#x96;42. We, like Judge Williams, disagree with the latter conclusion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The conflict with al Qaeda is not, according to the Government, a conflict to which the full protections afforded detainees under the 1949 Geneva Conventions apply because Article 2 of those Conventions (which appears in all four Conventions) renders the full protections applicable only to &#x93;all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties.&#x94;  6 U.

One such provision prohibits &#x93;the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals thought, and the Government asserts, that Common Article 3 does not apply to Hamdan because the conflict with al Qaeda, being &#x93; &#x91;international in scope,&#x92; &#x94; does not qualify as a &#x93; &#x91;conflict not of an international character.&#x92; &#x94;  415 F. 3d, at 41.  That reasoning is erroneous.  The term &#x93;conflict not of an international character&#x94; is used here in contradistinction to a conflict between nations.  So much is demonstrated by the &#x93;fundamental logic [of] the Convention&#x92;s provisions on its application.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 44 (Williams, J., concurring).  Common Article 2 provides that &#x93;the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties.&#x94;  6 U. S. T., at 3318 (Art. 2, &#xB6;1).  High Contracting Parties (signatories) also must abide by all terms of the Conventions vis-&amp;Agrave;-vis one another even if one party to the conflict is a nonsignatory &#x93;Power,&#x94; and must so abide vis-&amp;Agrave;-vis the nonsignatory if &#x93;the latter accepts and applies&#x94; those terms.  <em>Ibid.</em> (Art. 2, &#xB6;3).  Common Article 3, by contrast, affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory &#x93;Power&#x94; who are involved in a conflict &#x93;in the territory of&#x94; a signatory.  The latter kind of conflict is distinguishable from the conflict described in Common Article 2 chiefly because it does not involve a clash between nations (whether signatories or not).  In context, then, the phrase &#x93;not of an international character&#x94; bears its literal meaning.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, J. Bentham, Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation 6, 296 (J. Burns &amp; H. Hart eds. 1970) (using the term &#x93;international law&#x94; as a &#x93;new though not inexpressive appellation&#x94; meaning &#x93;betwixt nation and nation&#x94;; defining &#x93;international&#x94; to include &#x93;mutual transactions between sovereigns as such&#x94;); Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, p. 1351 (1987) (&#x93;[A] non-international armed conflict is distinct from an international armed conflict because of the legal status of the entities opposing each other&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Although the official commentaries accompanying Common Article 3 indicate that an important purpose of the provision was to furnish minimal protection to rebels involved in one kind of &#x93;conflict not of an international character,&#x94; <em>i.e.</em>, a civil war, see GCIII Commentary 36&#x96;37, the commentaries also make clear &#x93;that the scope of the Article must be as wide as possible,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 36.<a name="ZO-63ref" href="#ZO-63" class="">

            </a>  In fact, limiting language that would have rendered Common Article 3 applicable &#x93;especially [to] cases of civil war, colonial conflicts, or wars of religion,&#x94; was omitted from the final version of the Article, which coupled broader scope of application with a narrower range of rights than did earlier proposed iterations.

None of those cases says that the absence of an express provision reserving jurisdiction over pending cases trumps or renders irrelevant any other indications of congressional intent.  Indeed, Bruner itself relied on such other indications&#x96;including a negative inference drawn from the statutory text, cf. infra, at 13&#x96;to support its conclusion that jurisdiction was not available.   The Court observed that (1) Congress had been put on notice by prior lower court cases addressing the Tucker Act that it ought to specifically reserve jurisdiction over pending cases, see 343 U. S., at 115, and (2) in contrast to the congressional silence concerning reservation of jurisdiction, reservation had been made of &#x93; &#x91;any rights or liabilities&#x92; existing at the effective date of the Act&#x94; repealed by another provision of the Act, ibid., n. 7.

).  Certainly, the &#x93;effective date&#x94; provision cannot bear the weight Justice Scalia would place on it.  See post, at 5, and n. 1.  Congress deemed that provision insufficient, standing alone, to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable to pending cases; hence its adoption of subsection (h)(2).  Justice Scalia seeks to avoid reducing subsection (h)(2) to a mere redundancy&#x97;a consequence he seems to acknowledge must otherwise follow from his interpretation&#x97;by speculating that Congress had special reasons, not also relevant to subsection (e)(1), to worry that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) would be ruled inapplicable to pending cases.  As we explain infra, at 17, and n. 12, that attempt fails.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-10" href="#ZO-10ref">10</a> We note that statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to what the text of the DTA and its drafting history already make plain.  Senator Levin, one of the sponsors of the final bill, objected to earlier versions of the Act&#x92;s &#x93;effective date&#x94; provision that would have made subsection (e)(1) applicable to pending cases.  See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. S12667 (Nov. 10, 2005) (amendment proposed by Sen. Graham that would have rendered what is now subsection (e)(1) applicable to &#x93;any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act&#x94;).  Senator Levin urged adoption of an alternative amendment that &#x93;would apply only to new habeas cases filed after the date of enactment.&#x94;  Id., at S12802 (Nov. 15, 2005).  That alternative amendment became the text of subsection (h)(2).  (In light of the extensive discussion of the DTA&#x92;s effect on pending cases prior to passage of the Act, see, e.g., id., at S12664 (Nov. 10, 2005); id., at S12755 (Nov. 14, 2005); id., at S12799&#x96;S12802 (Nov. 15, 2005); id., at S14245, S14252&#x96;S14253, S14257&#x96;S14258, S14274&#x96;S14275 (Dec. 21, 2005), it cannot be said that the changes to subsection (h)(2) were inconsequential.  Cf. post, at 14 (Scalia, J., dissenting).)


While statements attributed to the final bill&#x92;s two other sponsors, Senators Graham and Kyl, arguably contradict Senator Levin&#x92;s contention that the final version of the Act preserved jurisdiction over pending habeas cases, see 151 Cong. Rec. S14263&#x96;S14264 (Dec. 21, 2005), those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record after the Senate debate.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 5, n. 6; see also 151 Cong. Rec. S14260 (statement of Sen. Kyl) (&#x93;I would like to say a few words about the now-completed National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006&#x94; (emphasis added)).  All statements made during the debate itself support Senator Levin&#x92;s understanding that the final text of the DTA would not render subsection (e)(1) applicable to pending cases.  See, e.g., id., at S14245, S14252&#x96;S14253, S14274&#x96;S14275 (Dec. 21, 2005).  The statements that Justice Scalia cites as evidence to the contrary construe subsection (e)(3) to strip this Court of jurisdiction, see post, at 12, n. 4 (dissenting opinion) (quoting 151 Cong. Rec. S12796 (Nov. 15, 2005) (statement of Sen. Specter))&#x97;a construction that the Government has expressly disavowed in this litigation, see n. 11, infra.  The inapposite November 14, 2005, statement of Senator Graham, which Justice Scalia cites as evidence of that Senator&#x92;s &#x93;assumption that pending cases are covered,&#x94; post, at 12, and n. 3 (citing 151 Cong. Rec. S12756 (Nov. 14, 2005)), follows directly after the uncontradicted statement of his co-sponsor, Senator Levin, assuring members of the Senate that &#x93;the amendment will not strip the courts of jurisdiction over [pending] cases.&#x94;  Id., at S12755.

S. T. 3316, 3318.  See Part VI, infra.  Although the Court of Appeals rejected the Article 3 argument on the merits, it also stated that, because the challenge was not &#x93;jurisdictional,&#x94; it did not fall within the exception that Schlesinger v. Councilman, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a> (1975)
, recognized for defendants who raise substantial arguments that a military tribunal lacks personal jurisdiction over them.  See 415 F. 3d, at 42.


In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals conflated two distinct inquiries: (1) whether Hamdan has raised a substantial argument that the military commission lacks authority to try him; and, more fundamentally, (2) whether the comity considerations underlying Councilman apply to trigger the abstention principle in the first place.  As the Court of Appeals acknowledged at the beginning of its opinion, the first question warrants consideration only if the answer to the second is yes.  See 415 F. 3d, at 36&#x96;37.  Since, as the Court of Appeals properly concluded, the answer to the second question is in fact no, there is no need to consider any exception.


At any rate, it appears that the exception would apply here.  As discussed in Part VI, infra, Hamdan raises a substantial argument that, because the military commission that has been convened to try him is not a &#x93; &#x91;regularly constituted court&#x92; &#x94; under the Geneva Conventions, it is ultra vires and thus lacks jurisdiction over him.

&#x93;If, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, then, on the theatre of active military operations, where war really prevails, there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society; and as no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course.  As necessity creates the rule, so it limits its duration; for, if this government is continued after the courts are reinstated, it is a gross usurpation of power.  Martial rule can never exist where the courts are open, and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction.  It is also confined to the locality of actual war.&#x94;  4 Wall., at 127 (emphases in original).

Hence, &#x93;military commanders began the practice [during the Civil War] of using the same name, the same rules, and often the same tribunals&#x94; to try both ordinary crimes and war crimes.  Bickers, 34 Tex. Tech. L. Rev., at 908.  &#x93;For the first time, accused horse thieves and alleged saboteurs found themselves subject to trial by the same military commission.&#x94;  Id., at 909.  The Civil War precedents must therefore be considered with caution; as we recognized in Quirin, 317 U.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-31" href="#ZO-31ref">31</a> Justice Thomas would treat Osama bin Laden&#x92;s 1996 declaration of jihad against Americans as the inception of the war.   See post, at 7&#x96;10 (dissenting opinion).  But even the Government does not go so far; although the United States had for some time prior to the attacks of September 11, 2001, been aggressively pursuing al Qaeda, neither in the charging document nor in submissions before this Court has the Government asserted that the President&#x92;s war powers were activated prior to September 11, 2001.  Cf. Brief for Respondents 25 (describing the events of September 11, 2001, as &#x93;an act of war&#x94; that &#x93;triggered a right to deploy military forces abroad to defend the United States by combating al Qaeda&#x94;).  Justice Thomas&#x92; further argument that the AUMF is &#x93;backward looking&#x94; and therefore authorizes trial by military commission of crimes that occurred prior to the inception of war is insupportable.  See post, at 8, n. 3.  If nothing else, Article 21 of the UCMJ requires that the President comply with the law of war in his use of military commissions.  As explained in the text, the law of war permits trial only of offenses &#x93;committed within the period of the war.&#x94;  Winthrop 837; see also Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28&#x96;29 (observing that law-of-war military commissions may be used to try &#x93;those enemies who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have violated the law of war&#x94; (emphasis added)).  The sources that Justice Thomas relies on to suggest otherwise simply do not support his position.  Colonel Green&#x92;s short exegesis on military commissions cites Howland for the proposition that &#x93;[o]ffenses committed before a formal declaration of war or before the declaration of martial law may be tried by military commission.&#x94;  The Military Commission, 42 Am. J. Int&#x92;l L. 832, 848 (1948) (emphases added) (cited post, at 9&#x96;10).  Assuming that to be true, nothing in our analysis turns on the admitted absence of either a formal declaration of war or a declaration of martial law.  Our focus instead is on the September 11, 2001 attacks that the Government characterizes as the relevant &#x93;act[s] of war,&#x94; and on the measure that authorized the President&#x92;s deployment of military force&#x97;the AUMF.   Because we do not question the Government&#x92;s position that the war commenced with the events of September 11, 2001, the Prize Cases, 
2Black
635 (1863) (cited post, at 2, 7, 8, and 10 (Thomas, J., dissenting)), are not germane to the analysis.


Finally, Justice Thomas&#x92; assertion that Julius Otto Kuehn&#x92;s trial by military commission &#x93;for conspiring with Japanese officials to betray the United States fleet to the Imperial Japanese Government prior to its attack on Pearl Harbor&#x94; stands as authoritative precedent for Hamdan&#x92;s trial by commission, post, at 9, misses the mark in three critical respects.  First, Kuehn was tried for the federal espionage crimes under what were then 50 U. S C. &#xA7;&#xA7;31, 32, and 34, not with common-law violations of the law of war.  See Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 30, pp. 3067&#x96;3069 (1946).  Second, he was tried by martial law commission (a kind of commission Justice Thomas acknowledges is not relevant to the analysis here, and whose jurisdiction extends to offenses committed within &#x93;the exercise of . . . martial law,&#x94; Winthrop 837, see supra, n. 28), not a commission established exclusively to try violations of the law of war.  See ibid.   Third, the martial law commissions established to try crimes in Hawaii were ultimately declared illegal by this Court.  See Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/304" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 304</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">324</a> (1946)
 (&#x93;The phrase &#x91;martial law&#x92; as employed in [the Hawaiian Organic Act], while intended to authorize the military to act vigorously for the maintenance of an orderly civil government and for the defense of the Islands against actual or threatened rebellion or invasion, was not intended to authorize the supplanting of courts by military tribunals&#x94;).
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-32" href="#ZO-32ref">32</a> Justice Thomas adopts the remarkable view, not advocated by the Government, that the charging document in this case actually includes more than one charge: Conspiracy and several other ill-defined crimes, like &#x93;joining an organization&#x94; that has a criminal purpose, &#x93; &#x91;[b]eing a guerilla,&#x92; &#x94; and aiding the enemy.  See post, at 16&#x96;21, and n. 9.  There are innumerable problems with this approach.


First, the crimes Justice Thomas identifies were not actually charged.  It is one thing to observe that charges before a military commission &#x93; &#x91;need not be stated with the precision of a common law indictment,&#x92; &#x94; post, at 15, n. 7 (citation omitted); it is quite another to say that a crime not charged may nonetheless be read into an indictment.   Second, the Government plainly had available to it the tools and the time it needed to charge petitioner with the various crimes Justice Thomas refers to, if it believed they were supported by the allegations.  As Justice Thomas himself observes, see post, at 21, the crime of aiding the enemy may, in circumstances where the accused owes allegiance to the party whose enemy he is alleged to have aided, be triable by military commission pursuant to Article 104 of the UCMJ, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/904.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;904</a>.  Indeed, the Government has charged detainees under this provision when it has seen fit to do so.  See Brief for David Hicks as Amicus Curiae 7.


Third, the cases Justice Thomas relies on to show that Hamdan may be guilty of violations of the law of war not actually charged do not support his argument.  Justice Thomas begins by blurring the distinction between those categories of &#x93;offender&#x94; who may be tried by military commission (e.g., jayhawkers and the like) with the &#x93;offenses&#x94; that may be so tried.  Even when it comes to &#x93; &#x91;being a guerilla,&#x92; &#x94; cf. post, at 18, n. 9 (citation omitted), a label alone does not render a person susceptible to execution or other criminal punishment; the charge of &#x93; &#x91;being a guerilla&#x92; &#x94; invariably is accompanied by the allegation that the defendant &#x93; &#x91;took up arms&#x92; &#x94; as such.  This is because, as explained by Judge Advocate General Holt in a decision upholding the charge of &#x93; &#x91;being a guerilla&#x92; &#x94; as one recognized by &#x93;the universal usage of the times,&#x94; the charge is simply shorthand (akin to &#x93;being a spy&#x94;) for &#x93;the perpetration of a succession of similar acts&#x94; of violence.  Record Books of the Judge Advocate General Office, R. 3, 590.   The sources cited by Justice Thomas confirm as much.  See cases cited post, at 18, n. 9.


Likewise, the suggestion that the Nuremberg precedents support Hamdan&#x92;s conviction for the (uncharged) crime of joining a criminal organization must fail.  Cf. post, at 19&#x96;21.  The convictions of certain high-level Nazi officials for &#x93;membership in a criminal organization&#x94; were secured pursuant to specific provisions of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal that permitted indictment of individual organization members following convictions of the organizations themselves.  See Arts. 9 and 10, in 1 Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal 12 (1947).   The initial plan to use organizations&#x92; convictions as predicates for mass individual trials ultimately was abandoned.  See T. Taylor, Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir 584&#x96;585, 638 (1992).

Although the charge against the defendants in that case accused them of &#x93;combining, confederating, and conspiring together&#x94; to murder the President, they were also charged (as we read the indictment, cf. post, at 23, n. 14 (Thomas, J., dissenting)) with &#x93;maliciously, unlawfully, and traitorously murdering the said Abraham Lincoln.&#x94;  H.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), drawing on the Nuremberg precedents, has adopted a &#x93;joint criminal enterprise&#x94; theory of liability, but that is a species of liability for the substantive offense (akin to aiding and abetting), not a crime on its own.

But even if Congress was concerned with ensuring uniformity across service branches, that does not mean it did not also intend to codify the longstanding practice of procedural parity between courts-martial and other military tribunals.  Indeed, the suggestion that Congress did not intend uniformity across tribunal types is belied by the textual proximity of subsection (a) (which requires that the rules governing criminal trials in federal district courts apply, absent the President&#x92;s determination of impracticability, to courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions alike) and subsection (b) (which imposes the uniformity requirement).

Moreover, the only additional reason the comments provide&#x97;aside from the general danger posed by international terrorism&#x97;for departures from court-martial procedures is the need to protect classified information.

Not only did Madsen not involve a law-of-war military commission, but (1) the petitioner there did not challenge the procedures used to try her, (2) the UCMJ, with its new Article 36(b), did not become effective until May 31, 1951, after the petitioner&#x92;s trial,  see 343 U.

            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Stevens</span> announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I through IV, Parts VI through VI&#x96;D&#x96;iii, Part VI&#x96;D&#x96;v, and Part VII, and an opinion with respect to Parts V and VI&#x96;D&#x96;iv, in which <span class="smallcaps">Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, </span>and <span class="smallcaps">Justice Breyer</span> join.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni national, is in custody at an American prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  In November 2001, during hostilities between the United States and the Taliban (which then governed Afghanistan), Hamdan was captured by militia forces and turned over to the U. S. military.  In June 2002, he was transported to Guantanamo Bay.  Over a year later, the President deemed him eligible for trial by military commission for then-unspecified crimes.  After another year had passed, Hamdan was charged with one count of conspiracy &#x93;to commit &#x2026; offenses triable by military commission.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus and mandamus to challenge the Executive Branch&#x92;s intended means of prosecuting this charge.  He concedes that a court-martial constituted in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/801.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;801</a>
            <em>et seq.</em> (2000 ed. and Supp. III), would have authority to try him.  His objection is that the military commission the President has convened lacks such authority, for two principal reasons: First, neither congressional Act nor the common law of war supports trial by this commission for the crime of conspiracy&#x97;an offense that, Hamdan says, is not a violation of the law of war.  Second, Hamdan contends, the procedures that the President has adopted to try him violate the most basic tenets of military and international law, including the principle that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear the evidence against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The District Court granted Hamdan&#x92;s request for a writ of habeas corpus.  344 F. Supp. 2d 152 (DC 2004).  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  415 F. 3d 33 (2005).  Recognizing, as we did over a half-century ago, that trial by military commission is an extraordinary measure raising important questions about the balance of powers in our constitutional structure, <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>

, we granted certiorari.  546 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the military commission convened to try Hamdan lacks power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the Geneva Conventions.  Four of us also conclude, see Part V, <em>infra</em>, that the offense with which Hamdan has been charged is not an &#x93;offens[e] that by &#x2026; the law of war may be tried by military commissions.&#x94;  10  U.

        <p class="bodytext">    Congress responded by adopting a Joint Resolution authorizing the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks &#x2026; in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF),

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1541.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. &#xA7;1541</a> (2000 ed., Supp. III).  Acting pursuant to the AUMF, and having determined that the Taliban regime had supported al Qaeda, the President ordered the Armed Forces of the United States to invade Afghanistan.  In the ensuing hostilities, hundreds of individuals, Hamdan among them, were captured and eventually detained at Guantanamo Bay.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On November 13, 2001, while the United States was still engaged in active combat with the Taliban, the President issued a comprehensive military order intended to govern the &#x93;Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,&#x94; 66 Fed. Reg. 57833 (hereinafter November 13 Order or Order).  Those subject to the November 13 Order include any noncitizen for whom the President determines &#x93;there is reason to believe&#x94; that he or she (1) &#x93;is or was&#x94; a member of al Qaeda or (2) has engaged or participated in terrorist activities aimed at or harmful to the United States.  <em>Id.</em>, at 57834.  Any such individual &#x93;shall, when tried, be tried by military commission for any and all offenses triable by military commission that such individual is alleged to have committed, and may be punished in accordance with the penalties provided under applicable law, including imprisonment or death.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  The November 13 Order vested in the Secretary of Defense the power to appoint military commissions to try individuals subject to the Order, but that power has since been delegated to John D. Altenberg, Jr., a retired Army major general and longtime military lawyer who has been designated &#x93;Appointing Authority for Military Commissions.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On July 3, 2003, the President announced his determination that Hamdan and five other detainees at Guantanamo Bay were subject to the November 13 Order and thus triable by military commission.  In December 2003, military counsel was appointed to represent Hamdan.  Two months later, counsel filed demands for charges and for a speedy trial pursuant to Article 10 of the UCMJ, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/810.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;810</a>.  On February 23, 2004, the legal adviser to the Appointing Authority denied the applications, ruling that Hamdan was not entitled to any of the protections of the UCMJ.  Not until July 13, 2004, after Hamdan had commenced this action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, did the Government finally charge him with the offense for which, a year earlier, he had been deemed eligible for trial by military commission.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The charging document, which is unsigned, contains 13 numbered paragraphs.  The first two paragraphs recite the asserted bases for the military commission&#x92;s jurisdiction&#x97;namely, the November 13 Order and the President&#x92;s July 3, 2003, declaration that Hamdan is eligible for trial by military commission.  The next nine paragraphs, collectively entitled &#x93;General Allegations,&#x94; describe al Qaeda&#x92;s activities from its inception in 1989 through 2001 and identify Osama bin Laden as the group&#x92;s leader.  Hamdan is not mentioned in these paragraphs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Only the final two paragraphs, entitled &#x93;Charge: Conspiracy,&#x94; contain allegations against Hamdan.  Paragraph 12 charges that &#x93;from on or about February 1996 to on or about November 24, 2001,&#x94; Hamdan &#x93;willfully and knowingly joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose and conspired and agreed with [named members of al Qaeda] to commit the following offenses triable by military commission: attacking civilians; attacking civilian objects; murder by an unprivileged belligerent; and terrorism.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.  There is no allegation that Hamdan had any command responsibilities, played a leadership role, or participated in the planning of any activity.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Paragraph 13 lists four &#x93;overt acts&#x94; that Hamdan is alleged to have committed sometime between 1996 and November 2001 in furtherance of the &#x93;enterprise and conspiracy&#x94;: (1) he acted as Osama bin Laden&#x92;s &#x93;bodyguard and personal driver,&#x94; &#x93;believ[ing]&#x94; all the while that bin Laden &#x93;and his associates were involved in&#x94; terrorist acts prior to and including the attacks of September 11, 2001; (2) he arranged for transportation of, and actually transported, weapons used by al Qaeda members and by bin Laden&#x92;s bodyguards (Hamdan among them); (3) he &#x93;drove or accompanied [O]sama bin Laden to various al Qaida-sponsored training camps, press conferences, or lectures,&#x94; at which bin Laden encouraged attacks against Americans; and (4) he received weapons training at al Qaeda-sponsored camps.  <em>Id.</em>, at 65a&#x96;67a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After this formal charge was filed, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington transferred Hamdan&#x92;s habeas and mandamus petitions to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  Meanwhile, a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) convened pursuant to a military order issued on July 7, 2004, decided that Hamdan&#x92;s continued detention at Guantanamo Bay was warranted because he was an &#x93;enemy combatant.&#x94;<a name="ZO-1ref" href="#ZO-1" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    On November 8, 2004, however, the District Court granted Hamdan&#x92;s petition for habeas corpus and stayed the commission&#x92;s proceedings.  It concluded that the President&#x92;s authority to establish military commissions extends only to &#x93;offenders or offenses triable by military [commission] under the law of war,&#x94; 344 F. Supp. 2d, at 158; that the law of war includes the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, T. I. A. S. No. 3364 (Third Geneva Convention); that Hamdan is entitled to the full protections of the Third Geneva Convention until adjudged, in compliance with that treaty, not to be a prisoner of war; and that, whether or not Hamdan is properly classified as a prisoner of war, the military commission convened to try him was established in violation of both the UCMJ and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva Convention because it had the power to convict based on evidence the accused would never see or hear.  344 F. Supp. 2d, at 158&#x96;172.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals declined the Government&#x92;s invitation to abstain from considering Hamdan&#x92;s challenge.  Cf. <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman,</em>

.  On the merits, the panel rejected the District Court&#x92;s further conclusion that Hamdan was entitled to relief under the Third Geneva Convention.  All three judges agreed that the Geneva Conventions were not &#x93;judicially enforceable,&#x94; 415 F. 3d, at 38, and two thought that the Conventions did not in any event apply to Hamdan, <em>id.</em>, at 40&#x96;42; but see <em>id.</em>, at 44 (Williams, J., concurring).  In other portions of its opinion, the court concluded that our decision in <em>Quirin</em> foreclosed any separation-of-powers objection to the military commission&#x92;s jurisdiction, and held that Hamdan&#x92;s trial before the contemplated commission would violate neither the UCMJ nor U. S. Armed Forces regulations intended to implement the Geneva Conventions.  415 F. 3d, at 38, 42&#x96;43.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On November 7, 2005, we granted certiorari to decide whether the military commission convened to try Hamdan has authority to do so, and whether Hamdan may rely on the Geneva Conventions in these proceedings.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    On February 13, 2006, the Government filed a motion to dismiss the writ of certiorari.  The ground cited for dismissal was the recently enacted Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), Pub. L. 109&#x96;148,

2739.  We postponed our ruling on that motion pending argument on the merits, 546 U. S. ___ (2006), and now deny it.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The DTA, which was signed into law on December 30, 2005, addresses a broad swath of subjects related to detainees.

Subsections (a) through (d) of &#xA7;1005 direct the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the procedures being used by CSRTs to determine the proper classification of detainees held in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and to adopt certain safeguards as part of those procedures.</p>

The Act is silent about whether paragraph (1) of subsection (e) &#x93;shall apply&#x94; to claims pending on the date of enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government argues that &#xA7;&#xA7;1005(e)(1) and 1005(h) had the immediate effect, upon enactment, of repealing federal jurisdiction not just over detainee habeas actions yet to be filed but also over any such actions then pending in any federal court&#x97;including this Court.  Accordingly, it argues, we lack jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision below.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan objects to this theory on both constitutional and statutory grounds.  Principal among his constitutional arguments is that the Government&#x92;s preferred reading raises grave questions about Congress&#x92; authority to impinge upon this Court&#x92;s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases.  Support for this argument is drawn from <em>Ex parte Yerger,</em>8Wall.

See <em>id.</em>, at 104&#x96;105; see also <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin,</em>

            </a> could not have been &#x93;a plainer instance of positive exception&#x94;).  Hamdan also suggests that, if the Government&#x92;s reading is correct, Congress has unconstitutionally suspended the writ of habeas corpus.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We find it unnecessary to reach either of these arguments.  Ordinary principles of statutory construction suffice to rebut the Government&#x92;s theory&#x97;at least insofar as this case, which was pending at the time the DTA was enacted, is concerned.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government acknowledges that only paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (e) are expressly made applicable to pending cases, see &#xA7;1005(h)(2), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743&#x96;2744, but argues that the omission of paragraph (1) from the scope of that express statement is of no moment.  This is so, we are told, because Congress&#x92; failure to expressly reserve federal courts&#x92; jurisdiction over pending cases erects a presumption against jurisdiction, and that presumption is rebutted by neither the text nor the legislative history of the DTA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first part of this argument is not entirely without support in our precedents.

            </a>  If a statutory provision &#x93;would operate retroactively&#x94; as applied to cases pending at the time the provision was enacted, then &#x93;our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 280.  We have explained, however, that, unlike other intervening changes in the law, a jurisdiction-conferring or jurisdiction-stripping statute usually &#x93;takes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case.&#x94;  <em>Hallowell</em>, 239 U. S., at 508.  If that is truly all the statute does, no retroactivity problem arises because the change in the law does not &#x93;impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party&#x92;s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U.

            </a>  A familiar principle of statutory construction, relevant both in <em>Lindh</em> and here, is that a negative inference may be drawn from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute.

 (&#x93; &#x91;[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion&#x92; &#x94;).  The Court in <em>Lindh</em> relied on this reasoning to conclude that certain limitations on the availability of habeas relief imposed by AEDPA applied only to cases filed after that statute&#x92;s effective date.  Congress&#x92; failure to identify the temporal reach of those limitations, which governed noncapital cases, stood in contrast to its express command in the same legislation that new rules governing habeas petitions in capital cases &#x93;apply to cases pending on or after the date of enactment.&#x94;  &#xA7;107(c), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
1226; see <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329&#x96;330.  That contrast, combined with the fact that the amendments at issue &#x93;affect[ed] substantive entitlement to relief,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 327, warranted drawing a negative inference.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A like inference follows <em>a fortiori </em>from <em>Lindh</em> in this case.  &#x93;If &#x2026; Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure that [&#xA7;&#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)] be applied to pending cases, it should have been just as concerned about [&#xA7;1005(e)(1)], unless it had the different intent that the latter [section] not be applied to the general run of pending cases.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  If anything, the evidence of deliberate omission is stronger here than it was in <em>Lindh</em>.  In <em>Lindh</em>, the provisions to be contrasted had been drafted separately but were later &#x93;joined together and &#x2026; considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 330.  We observed that Congress&#x92; tandem review and approval of the two sets of provisions strengthened the presumption that the relevant omission was deliberate.  <em>Id.</em>, at 331; see also <em>Field</em> v. <em>Mans,</em>

 (&#x93;The more apparently deliberate the contrast, the stronger the inference, as applied, for example, to contrasting statutory sections originally enacted simultaneously in relevant respects&#x94;).  Here, Congress not only considered the respective temporal reaches of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (e) together at every stage, but omitted paragraph (1) from its directive that paragraphs (2) and (3) apply to pending cases only after having <em>rejected</em> earlier proposed versions of the statute that would have included what is now paragraph (1) within the scope of that directive.

        <p class="bodytext">    The Government nonetheless offers two reasons why, in its view, no negative inference may be drawn in favor of jurisdiction.  First, it asserts that <em>Lindh</em> is inapposite because &#x93;Section 1005(e)(1) and (h)(1) remove jurisdiction, while Section 1005(e)(2), (3) and (h)(2) create an exclusive review mechanism and define the nature of that review.&#x94;  Reply Brief in Support of Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss 4.

        <p class="bodytext">    The Government&#x92;s second objection is that applying subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) but not (e)(1) to pending cases &#x93;produces an absurd result&#x94; because it grants (albeit only temporarily) dual jurisdiction over detainees&#x92; cases in circumstances where the statute plainly envisions that the District of Columbia Circuit will have &#x93;<em>exclusive</em>&#x94; and immediate jurisdiction over such cases.

But the premise here is faulty; subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) grant jurisdiction only over actions to &#x93;determine the validity of any final decision&#x94; of a CSRT or commission.  Because Hamdan, at least, is not contesting any &#x93;final decision&#x94; of a CSRT or military commission, his action does not fall within the scope of subsection (e)(2) or (e)(3).  There is, then, no absurdity.<a name="ZO-14ref" href="#ZO-14" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The Government&#x92;s more general suggestion that Congress can have had no good reason for preserving habeas jurisdiction over cases that had been brought by detainees prior to enactment of the DTA not only is belied by the legislative history, see n. 10, <em>supra</em>, but is otherwise without merit.  There is nothing absurd about a scheme under which pending habeas actions&#x97;particularly those, like this one, that challenge the very legitimacy of the tribunals whose judgments Congress would like to have reviewed&#x97;are preserved, and more routine challenges to final decisions rendered by those tribunals are carefully channeled to a particular court and through a particular lens of review.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, we cannot leave unaddressed <span class="smallcaps">Justice Scalia</span>&#x92;s contentions that the &#x93;meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear,&#x94; <em>post</em>, at 6, and that &#x93;the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed,&#x94; <em>post</em>, at 3 (emphasis in original).  Only by treating the <em>Bruner</em> rule as an inflexible trump (a thing it has never been, see n. 7, <em>supra</em>) and ignoring both the rest of &#xA7;1005&#x92;s text and its drafting history can one conclude as much.  Congress here expressly provided that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applied to pending cases.  It chose not to so provide&#x97;after having been presented with the option&#x97;for subsection (e)(1).  The omission is an integral part of the statutory scheme that muddies whatever &#x93;plain meaning&#x94; may be discerned from blinkered study of subsection (e)(1) alone.  The dissent&#x92;s speculation about what Congress might have intended by the omission not only is counterfactual, cf. n. 10, <em>supra</em> (recounting legislative history), but rests on both a misconstruction of the DTA and an erroneous view our precedents, see <em>supra</em>, at 17, and n. 12.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Councilman</em>, an army officer on active duty was referred to a court-martial for trial on charges that he violated the UCMJ by selling, transferring, and possessing marijuana.  420 U.

Objecting that the alleged offenses were not &#x93; &#x91;service connected,&#x92; &#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 740, the officer filed suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the proceedings.  He neither questioned the lawfulness of courts-martial or their procedures nor disputed that, as a serviceman, he was subject to court-martial jurisdiction.  His sole argument was that the subject matter of his case did not fall within the scope of court-martial authority.  See <em>id.</em>, at 741, 759.  The District Court granted his request for injunctive relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>

            <em>Councilman</em> identifies two considerations of comity that together favor abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings against service personnel.

First, military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts.  See <em>Councilman</em>, 420 U. S., at 752.  Second, federal courts should respect the balance that Congress struck between military preparedness and fairness to individual service members when it created &#x93;an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals, consisting of civilian judges &#x91;completely removed from all military influence or persuasion &#x2026; .&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 758 (quoting H.

        <p class="bodytext">    The same cannot be said here; indeed, neither of the comity considerations identified in <em>Councilman </em>weighs in favor of abstention in this case.  First, Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.  Second, the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.  Unlike the officer in <em>Councilman</em>,<em/>Hamdan has no right to appeal any conviction to the civilian judges of the Court of Military Appeals (now called the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, see Pub.

Instead, under Dept. of Defense Military Commission Order No. 1 (Commission Order No. 1), which was issued by the President on March 21, 2002, and amended most recently on August 31, 2005, and which governs the procedures for Hamdan&#x92;s commission, any conviction would be reviewed by a panel consisting of three military officers designated by the Secretary of Defense.  Commission Order No. 1 &#xA7;6(H)(4).

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, neither of the two comity considerations underlying our decision to abstain in <em>Councilman</em> applies to the circumstances of this case.  Instead, this Court&#x92;s decision in <em>Quirin</em> is the most relevant precedent.  In <em>Quirin</em>, seven German saboteurs were captured upon arrival by submarine in New York and Florida.  317 U. S., at 21.  The President convened a military commission to try the saboteurs, who then filed habeas corpus petitions in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging their trial by commission.  We granted the saboteurs&#x92; petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals before judgment.  See <em>id.</em>, at 19.  Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.  That course of action was warranted, we explained, &#x93;[i]n view of the public importance of the questions raised by [the cases] and of the duty which rests on the courts, in time of war as well as in time of peace, to preserve unimpaired the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty, and because in our opinion the public interest required that we consider and decide those questions without any avoidable delay.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As the Court of Appeals here recognized, <em>Quirin </em>&#x93;provides a compelling historical precedent for the power of civilian courts to entertain challenges that seek to interrupt the processes of military commissions.&#x94;  415 F. 3d, at 36.<a name="ZO-20ref" href="#ZO-20" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the Government has identified no other &#x93;important countervailing interest&#x94; that would permit federal courts to depart from their general &#x93;duty to exercise the jurisdiction that is conferred upon them by Congress.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 716 (majority opinion).  To the contrary, Hamdan and the Government both have a compelling interest in knowing in advance whether Hamdan may be tried by a military commission that arguably is without any basis in law and operates free from many of the procedural rules prescribed by Congress for courts-martial&#x97;rules intended to safeguard the accused and ensure the reliability of any conviction.  While we certainly do not foreclose the possibility that abstention may be appropriate in some cases seeking review of ongoing military commission proceedings (such as military commissions convened on the battlefield), the foregoing discussion makes clear that, under our precedent, abstention is not justified here.  We therefore proceed to consider the merits of Hamdan&#x92;s challenge.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The military commission, a tribunal neither mentioned in the Constitution nor created by statute, was born of military necessity.  See W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 831 (rev. 2d ed. 1920) (hereinafter Winthrop).  Though foreshadowed in some respects by earlier tribunals like the Board of General Officers that General Washington convened to try British Major John Andr&#xE9; for spying during the Revolutionary War, the commission &#x93;as such&#x94; was inaugurated in 1847.  <em>Id.</em>, at 832; G. Davis, A Treatise on the Military Law of the United States 308 (2d ed. 1909) (hereinafter Davis).  As commander of occupied Mexican territory, and having available to him no other tribunal, General Winfield Scott that year ordered the establishment of both &#x93; &#x91;<em>military commissions</em>&#x92; &#x94; to try ordinary crimes committed in the occupied territory and a &#x93;<em>council of war</em>&#x94; to try offenses against the law of war.  Winthrop 832 (emphases in original).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When the exigencies of war next gave rise to a need for use of military commissions, during the Civil War, the dual system favored by General Scott was not adopted.  Instead, a single tribunal often took jurisdiction over ordinary crimes, war crimes, and breaches of military orders alike.  As further discussed below, each aspect of that seemingly broad jurisdiction was in fact supported by a separate military exigency.  Generally, though, the need for military commissions during this period&#x97;as during the Mexican War&#x97;was driven largely by the then very limited jurisdiction of courts-martial: &#x93;The <em>occasion</em> for the military commission arises principally from the fact that the jurisdiction of the court-martial proper, in our law, is restricted by statute almost exclusively to members of the military force and to certain specific offences defined in a written code.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 831 (emphasis in original).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Exigency alone, of course, will not justify the establishment and use of penal tribunals not contemplated by Article I, &#xA7;8 and Article III, &#xA7;1 of the Constitution unless some other part of that document authorizes a response to the felt need.

Commissions historically have been used in three situations.  See Bradley &amp; Goldsmith, Congressional Authorization and the War on Terrorism, 118 Harv. L.

Their use in these circumstances has raised constitutional questions, see <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Kahanamoku,</em>

            <em>Quirin</em> is the model the Government invokes most frequently to defend the commission convened to try Hamdan.  That is both appropriate and unsurprising.  Since Guantanamo Bay is neither enemy-occupied territory nor under martial law, the law-of-war commission is the only model available.  At the same time, no more robust model of executive power exists; <em>Quirin</em> represents the high-water mark of military power to try enemy combatants for war crimes.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The classic treatise penned by Colonel William Winthrop, whom we have called &#x93;the &#x91;Blackstone of Military Law,&#x92; &#x94; <em>Reid</em> v. <em>Covert,</em>

First, &#x93;[a] military commission, (except where otherwise authorized by statute), can legally assume jurisdiction only of offenses committed within the field of the command of the convening commander.&#x94;  Winthrop 836.  The &#x93;field of command&#x94; in these circumstances means the &#x93;theatre of war.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Second, the offense charged &#x93;must have been committed within the period of the war.&#x94;<a name="ZO-28ref" href="#ZO-28" class="">

Finally, a law-of-war commission has jurisdiction to try only two kinds of offense: &#x93;Violations of the laws and usages of war cognizable by military tribunals only,&#x94; and &#x93;[b]reaches of military orders or regulations for which offenders are not legally triable by court-martial under the Articles of war.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 839.<a name="ZO-29ref" href="#ZO-29" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    All parties agree that Colonel Winthrop&#x92;s treatise accurately describes the common law governing military commissions, and that the jurisdictional limitations he identifies were incorporated in Article of War 15 and, later, Article 21 of the UCMJ.  It also is undisputed that Hamdan&#x92;s commission lacks jurisdiction to try him unless the charge &#x93;properly set[s] forth, not only the details of the act charged, but the circumstances conferring <em>jurisdiction</em>.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 842 (emphasis in original).  The question is whether the preconditions designed to ensure that a military necessity exists to justify the use of this extraordinary tribunal have been satisfied here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The charge against Hamdan, described in detail in Part I, <em>supra</em>, alleges a conspiracy extending over a number of years, from 1996 to November 2001.<a name="ZO-30ref" href="#ZO-30" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    These facts alone cast doubt on the legality of the charge and, hence, the commission; as Winthrop makes plain, the offense alleged must have been committed both in a theater of war and <em>during</em>, not before, the relevant conflict.  But the deficiencies in the time and place allegations also underscore&#x97;indeed are symptomatic of&#x97;the most serious defect of this charge: The offense it alleges is not triable by law-of-war military commission.  See <em>Yamashita</em>, 327 U.

            </a>  As we explained in <em>Quirin</em>, that is not necessarily fatal to the Government&#x92;s claim of authority to try the alleged offense by military commission; Congress, through Article 21 of the UCMJ, has &#x93;incorporated by reference&#x94; the common law of war, which may render triable by military commission certain offenses not defined by statute.  317 U.

Although the picture arguably was less clear in <em>Yamashita</em>, compare 327 U. S., at 16 (stating that the provisions of the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907,

            </a>  Winthrop explains that under the common law governing military commissions, it is not enough to intend to violate the law of war and commit overt acts in furtherance of that intention unless the overt acts either are themselves offenses against the law of war or constitute steps sufficiently substantial to qualify as an attempt.  See Winthrop 841 (&#x93;[T]he jurisdiction of the military commission should be restricted to cases of offence consisting in <em>overt acts</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, in unlawful commissions or actual attempts to commit, and not in intentions merely&#x94; (emphasis in original)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government cites three sources that it says show otherwise.  First, it points out that the Nazi saboteurs in <em>Quirin</em> were charged with conspiracy.  See Brief for Respondents 27.  Second, it observes that Winthrop at one point in his treatise identifies conspiracy as an offense &#x93;prosecuted by military commissions.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing Winthrop 839, and n. 5).  Finally, it notes that another military historian, Charles Roscoe Howland, lists conspiracy &#x93; &#x91;to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the enemy&#x92; &#x94; as an offense that was tried as a violation of the law of war during the Civil War.  Brief for Respondents 27&#x96;28 (citing C. Howland, Digest of Opinions of the Judge Advocates General of the Army 1071 (1912) (hereinafter Howland)).  On close analysis, however, these sources at best lend little support to the Government&#x92;s position and at worst undermine it.  By any measure, they fail to satisfy the high standard of clarity required to justify the use of a military commission.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    That the defendants in <em>Quirin</em> were charged with conspiracy is not persuasive, since the Court declined to address whether the offense actually qualified as a violation of the law of war&#x97;let alone one triable by military commission.  The <em>Quirin</em> defendants were charged with the following offenses:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;[I.]Violation of the law of war.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

&#x93;[II.]Violation of Article 81 of the Articles of War, defining the offense of relieving or attempting to relieve, or corresponding with or giving intelligence to, the enemy.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

&#x93;[III.]Violation of Article 82, defining the offense of spying.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

&#x93;[IV.]Conspiracy to commit the offenses alleged in charges [I, II, and III].&#x94;  317 U. S., at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The Government, defending its charge, argued that the conspiracy alleged &#x93;constitute[d] an additional violation of the law of war.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  The saboteurs disagreed; they maintained that &#x93;[t]he charge of conspiracy can not stand if the other charges fall.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 8.  The Court, however, declined to resolve the dispute.  It concluded, first, that the specification supporting Charge I adequately alleged a &#x93;violation of the law of war&#x94; that was not &#x93;merely colorable or without foundation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 36.  The facts the Court deemed sufficient for this purpose were that the defendants, admitted enemy combatants, entered upon U. S. territory in time of war without uniform &#x93;for the purpose of destroying property used or useful in prosecuting the war.&#x94;  That act was &#x93;a hostile and warlike&#x94; one.  <em>Id.</em>, at 36, 37.  The Court was careful in its decision to identify an overt, &#x93;complete&#x94; act.  Responding to the argument that the saboteurs had &#x93;not actually committed or attempted to commit any act of depredation or entered the theatre or zone of active military operations&#x94; and therefore had not violated the law of war, the Court responded that they had actually &#x93;passed our military and naval lines and defenses or went behind those lines, in civilian dress and with hostile purpose.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 38.  &#x93;The offense was complete when with that purpose they entered&#x97;or, having so entered, they remained upon&#x97;our territory in time of war without uniform or other appropriate means of identification.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Turning to the other charges alleged, the Court explained that &#x93;[s]ince the first specification of Charge I sets forth a violation of the law of war, we have no occasion to pass on the adequacy of the second specification of Charge I, or to construe the 81st and 82nd Articles of War for the purpose of ascertaining whether the specifications under Charges II and III allege violations of those Articles or whether if so construed they are constitutional.&#x94;  Id., at 46.  No mention was made at all of Charge IV&#x97;the conspiracy charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If anything, <em>Quirin</em> supports Hamdan&#x92;s argument that conspiracy is not a violation of the law of war.  Not only did the Court pointedly omit any discussion of the conspiracy charge, but its analysis of Charge I placed special emphasis on the <em>completion</em> of an offense; it took seriously the saboteurs&#x92; argument that there can be no violation of a law of war&#x97;at least not one triable by military commission&#x97;without the actual commission of or attempt to commit a &#x93;hostile and warlike act.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 37&#x96;38.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    That limitation makes eminent sense when one considers the necessity from whence this kind of military commission grew: The need to dispense swift justice, often in the form of execution, to illegal belligerents captured on the battlefield.  See S. Rep. No. 130, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 40 (1916) (testimony of Brig. Gen. Enoch H. Crowder) (observing that Article of War 15 preserves the power of &#x93;the military commander <em>in the field in time of war</em>&#x94; to use military commissions (emphasis added)).  The same urgency would not have been felt vis-&amp;Agrave;-vis enemies who had done little more than agree to violate the laws of war.  Cf. 
31Op. Atty. Gen.
356,
357,
361 (1918) (opining that a German spy could not be tried by military commission because, having been apprehended before entering &#x93;any camp, fortification or other military premises of the United States,&#x94; he had &#x93;committed [his offenses] outside of the field of military operations&#x94;).  The <em>Quirin</em> Court acknowledged as much when it described the President&#x92;s authority to use law-of-war military commissions as the power to &#x93;seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies <em>who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort</em> have violated the law of war.&#x94;  317 U. S., at 28&#x96;29 (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Winthrop and Howland are only superficially more helpful to the Government.  Howland, granted, lists &#x93;conspiracy by two or more to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the enemy&#x94; as one of over 20 &#x93;offenses against the laws and usages of war&#x94; &#x93;passed upon and punished by military commissions.&#x94;  Howland 1071.  But while the records of cases that Howland cites following his list of offenses against the law of war support inclusion of the other offenses mentioned, they provide no support for the inclusion of conspiracy as a violation of the law of war.  See <em>ibid.</em> (citing Record Books of the Judge Advocate General Office, R. 2, 144; R. 3, 401, 589, 649; R. 4, 320; R. 5, 36, 590; R. 6, 20; R. 7, 413; R. 8, 529; R. 9, 149, 202, 225, 481, 524, 535; R. 10, 567; R. 11, 473, 513; R. 13, 125, 675; R. 16, 446; R. 21, 101, 280).  Winthrop, apparently recognizing as much, excludes conspiracy of any kind from his own list of offenses against the law of war.  See Winthrop 839&#x96;840.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Winthrop does, unsurprisingly, include &#x93;criminal conspiracies&#x94; in his list of &#x93;[c]rimes and statutory offenses cognizable by State or U. S. courts&#x94; and triable by martial law or military government commission.  See <em>id.</em>, at 839.  And, in a footnote, he cites several Civil War examples of &#x93;conspiracies of this class, <em>or of the first and second classes combined</em>.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 839, n. 5 (emphasis added).  The Government relies on this footnote for its contention that conspiracy was triable both as an ordinary crime (a crime of the &#x93;first class&#x94;) and, independently, as a war crime (a crime of the &#x93;second class&#x94;).  But the footnote will not support the weight the Government places on it.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As we have seen, the military commissions convened during the Civil War functioned at once as martial law or military government tribunals and as law-of-war commissions.  See n. 27, <em>supra</em>.  Accordingly, they regularly tried war crimes and ordinary crimes together.  Indeed, as Howland observes, &#x93;[n]ot infrequently the crime, as charged and found, was a combination of the two species of offenses.&#x94;  Howland 1071; see also Davis 310, n. 2; Winthrop 842.  The example he gives is &#x93; &#x91;murder in violation of the laws of war.&#x92; &#x94;  Howland 1071&#x96;1072.  Winthrop&#x92;s conspiracy &#x93;of the first and second classes combined&#x94; is, like Howland&#x92;s example, best understood as a species of compound offense of the type tried by the hybrid military commissions of the Civil War.  It is not a stand-alone offense against the law of war.  Winthrop confirms this understanding later in his discussion, when he emphasizes that &#x93;<em>overt acts</em>&#x94; constituting war crimes are the only proper subject at least of those military tribunals not convened to stand in for local courts.  Winthrop 841, and nn. 22, 23 (emphasis in original) (citing W. Finlason, Martial Law 130 (1867)).</p>

Winder, <em>while the evidence at the trial of Wirz was deemed by the court to implicate him in the conspiracy</em> against the lives of all Federal prisoners in rebel hands, <em>no such specific overt acts of violation of the laws of war</em> are as yet fixed upon him as to make it expedient to prefer formal charges and bring him to trial.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 783 (emphases added).<a name="ZO-37ref" href="#ZO-37" class="">

            </a>  As observed above, see <em>supra</em>, at 40, none of the major treaties governing the law of war identifies conspiracy as a violation thereof.  And the only &#x93;conspiracy&#x94; crimes that have been recognized by international war crimes tribunals (whose jurisdiction often extends beyond war crimes proper to crimes against humanity and crimes against the peace) are conspiracy to commit genocide and common plan to wage aggressive war, which is a crime against the peace and requires for its commission actual participation in a &#x93;concrete plan to wage war.&#x94;  1 Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal: Nuremberg, 14 November 1945&#x96;1 October 1946, p. 225 (1947).  The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, over the prosecution&#x92;s objections, pointedly refused to recognize as a violation of the law of war conspiracy to commit war crimes, see, <em>e.g.</em>, 22 <em>id.</em>, at 469,<a name="ZO-39ref" href="#ZO-39" class="">

As one prominent figure from the Nuremberg trials has explained, members of the Tribunal objected to recognition of conspiracy as a violation of the law of war on the ground that &#x93;[t]he Anglo-American concept of conspiracy was not part of European legal systems and arguably not an element of the internationally recognized laws of war.&#x94;  T.

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, the sources that the Government and <span class="smallcaps">Justice Thomas</span> rely upon to show that conspiracy to violate the law of war is itself a violation of the law of war in fact demonstrate quite the opposite.  Far from making the requisite substantial showing, the Government has failed even to offer a &#x93;merely colorable&#x94; case for inclusion of conspiracy among those offenses cognizable by law-of-war military commission.  Cf. <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 36.  Because the charge does not support the commission&#x92;s jurisdiction, the commission lacks authority to try Hamdan.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The charge&#x92;s shortcomings are not merely formal, but are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition&#x97;at least in the absence of specific congressional authorization&#x97;for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.  Hamdan&#x92;s tribunal was appointed not by a military commander in the field of battle, but by a retired major general stationed away from any active hostilities.  Cf. <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush, </em>542 U. S., at 487 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy, J.</span>, concurring in judgment) (observing that &#x93;Guantanamo Bay is &#x2026; far removed from any hostilities&#x94;).  Hamdan is charged not with an overt act for which he was caught redhanded in a theater of war and which military efficiency demands be tried expeditiously, but with an <em>agreement</em> the inception of which long predated the attacks of September 11, 2001 and the AUMF.  That may well be a crime,<a name="ZO-41ref" href="#ZO-41" class="">

            </a> but it is not an offense that &#x93;by the law of war may be tried by military commissio[n].&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/821.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;821</a>.  None of the overt acts alleged to have been committed in furtherance of the agreement is itself a war crime, or even necessarily occurred during time of, or in a theater of, war.  Any urgent need for imposition or execution of judgment is utterly belied by the record; Hamdan was arrested in November 2001 and he was not charged until mid-2004.  These simply are not the circumstances in which, by any stretch of the historical evidence or this Court&#x92;s precedents, a military commission established by Executive Order under the authority of Article 21 of the UCMJ may lawfully try a person and subject him to punishment.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">VI</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Whether or not the Government has charged Hamdan with an offense against the law of war cognizable by military commission, the commission lacks power to proceed.  The UCMJ conditions the President&#x92;s use of military commissions on compliance not only with the American common law of war, but also with the rest of the UCMJ itself, insofar as applicable, and with the &#x93;rules and precepts of the law of nations,&#x94; <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 28&#x97;including, <em>inter alia</em>, the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.  See <em>Yamashita</em>, 327 U. S., at 20&#x96;21, 23&#x96;24.  The procedures that the Government has decreed will govern Hamdan&#x92;s trial by commission violate these laws.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The commission&#x92;s procedures are set forth in Commission Order No. 1, which was amended most recently on </p>
        <p class="bodytext">August 31, 2005&#x97;after Hamdan&#x92;s trial had already begun.  Every commission established pursuant to Commission Order No. 1 must have a presiding officer and at least three other members, all of whom must be commissioned officers.  &#xA7;4(A)(1).  The presiding officer&#x92;s job is to rule on questions of law and other evidentiary and interlocutory issues; the other members make findings and, if applicable, sentencing decisions.  &#xA7;4(A)(5).  The accused is entitled to appointed military counsel and may hire civilian counsel at his own expense so long as such counsel is a U. S. citizen with security clearance &#x93;at the level SECRET or higher.&#x94;  &#xA7;&#xA7;4(C)(2)&#x96;(3).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The accused also is entitled to a copy of the charge(s) against him, both in English and his own language (if different), to a presumption of innocence, and to certain other rights typically afforded criminal defendants in civilian courts and courts-martial.  See &#xA7;&#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P).  These rights are subject, however, to one glaring condition: The accused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from, and precluded from ever learning what evidence was presented during, any part of the proceeding that either the Appointing Authority or the presiding officer decides to &#x93;close.&#x94;  Grounds for such closure &#x93;include the protection of information classified or classifiable &#x2026; ; information protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure; the physical safety of participants in Commission proceedings, including prospective witnesses; intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or activities; and other national security interests.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(B)(3).<a name="ZO-42ref" href="#ZO-42" class="">
                <sup>

                </sup>
            </a>  Appointed military defense counsel must be privy to these closed sessions, but may, at the presiding officer&#x92;s discretion, be forbidden to reveal to his or her client what took place therein.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Another striking feature of the rules governing Hamdan&#x92;s commission is that they permit the admission of any evidence that, in the opinion of the presiding officer, &#x93;would have probative value to a reasonable person.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(D)(1).  Under this test, not only is testimonial hearsay and evidence obtained through coercion fully admissible, but neither live testimony nor witnesses&#x92; written statements need be sworn.  See &#xA7;&#xA7;6(D)(2)(b), (3).  Moreover, the accused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to evidence in the form of &#x93;protected information&#x94; (which includes classified information as well as &#x93;information protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure&#x94; and &#x93;information concerning other national security interests,&#x94; &#xA7;&#xA7;6(B)(3), 6(D)(5)(a)(v)), so long as the presiding officer concludes that the evidence is &#x93;probative&#x94; under &#xA7;6(D)(1) and that its admission without the accused&#x92;s knowledge would not &#x93;result in the denial of a full and fair trial.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(D)(5)(b).<a name="ZO-43ref" href="#ZO-43" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>43</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  Finally, a presiding officer&#x92;s determination that evidence &#x93;would not have probative value to a reasonable person&#x94; may be overridden by a majority of the other commission members.  &#xA7;6(D)(1).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Once all the evidence is in, the commission members (not including the presiding officer) must vote on the accused&#x92;s guilt.  A two-thirds vote will suffice for both a verdict of guilty and for imposition of any sentence not including death (the imposition of which requires a unanimous vote).  &#xA7;6(F).  Any appeal is taken to a three-member review panel composed of military officers and designated by the Secretary of Defense, only one member of which need have experience as a judge.  &#xA7;6(H)(4).  The review panel is directed to &#x93;disregard any variance from procedures specified in this Order or elsewhere that would not materially have affected the outcome of the trial before the Commission.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Once the panel makes its recommendation to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary can either remand for further proceedings or forward the record to the President with his recommendation as to final disposition.  &#xA7;6(H)(5).  The President then, unless he has delegated the task to the Secretary, makes the &#x93;final decision.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(H)(6).  He may change the commission&#x92;s findings or sentence only in a manner favorable to the accused.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan raises both general and particular objections to the procedures set forth in Commission Order No. 1.  His general objection is that the procedures&#x92; admitted deviation from those governing courts-martial itself renders the commission illegal.  Chief among his particular objections are that he may, under the Commission Order, be convicted based on evidence he has not seen or heard, and that any evidence admitted against him need not comply with the admissibility or relevance rules typically applicable in criminal trials and court-martial proceedings.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government objects to our consideration of any procedural challenge at this stage on the grounds that (1) the abstention doctrine espoused in <em>Councilman</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a>, precludes pre-enforcement review of procedural rules, (2) Hamdan will be able to raise any such challenge following a &#x93;final decision&#x94; under the DTA, and (3) &#x93;there is &#x2026; no basis to presume, before the trial has even commenced, that the trial will not be conducted in good faith and according to law.&#x94;  Brief for Respondents 45&#x96;46, nn. 20&#x96;21.  The first of these contentions was disposed of in Part III, <em>supra</em>, and neither of the latter two is sound.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, because Hamdan apparently is not subject to the death penalty (at least as matters now stand) and may receive a sentence shorter than 10 years&#x92; imprisonment, he has no automatic right to review of the commission&#x92;s &#x93;final decision&#x94;<a name="ZO-44ref" href="#ZO-44" class="">

2743.  Second, contrary to the Government&#x92;s assertion, there <em>is</em> a &#x93;basis to presume&#x94; that the procedures employed during Hamdan&#x92;s trial will violate the law: The procedures are described with particularity in Commission Order No. 1, and implementation of some of them has already occurred.  One of Hamdan&#x92;s complaints is that he will be, and <em>indeed already has been</em>, excluded from his own trial.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 12; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a.  Under these circumstances, review of the procedures in advance of a &#x93;final decision&#x94;&#x97;the timing of which is left entirely to the discretion of the President under the DTA&#x97;is appropriate.  We turn, then, to consider the merits of Hamdan&#x92;s procedural challenge.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In part because the difference between military commissions and courts-martial originally was a difference of jurisdiction alone, and in part to protect against abuse and ensure evenhandedness under the pressures of war, the procedures governing trials by military commission historically have been the same as those governing courts-martial.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 1 The War of the Rebellion 248 (2d series 1894) (General Order 1 issued during the Civil War required military commissions to &#x93;be constituted in a similar manner and their proceedings be conducted according to the same general rules as courts-martial in order to prevent abuses which might otherwise arise&#x94;).  Accounts of commentators from Winthrop through General Crowder&#x97;who drafted Article of War 15 and whose views have been deemed &#x93;authoritative&#x94; by this Court, <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 353&#x97;confirm as much.<a name="ZO-45ref" href="#ZO-45" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>45</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  As recently as the Korean and Vietnam wars, during which use of military commissions was contemplated but never made, the principle of procedural parity was espoused as a background assumption.  See Paust, Antiterrorism Military Commissions: Courting Illegality, 23 Mich. J. Int&#x92;l L. 1, 3&#x96;5 (2001&#x96;2002).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There is a glaring historical exception to this general rule.  The procedures and evidentiary rules used to try General Yamashita near the end of World War II deviated in significant respects from those then governing courts-martial.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/1" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 1</a>.  The force of that precedent, however, has been seriously undermined by post-World War II developments.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Yamashita, from late 1944 until September 1945, was Commanding General of the Fourteenth Army Group of the Imperial Japanese Army, which had exercised control over the Philippine Islands.  On September 3, 1945, after American forces regained control of the Philippines, Yamashita surrendered.  Three weeks later, he was charged with violations of the law of war.  A few weeks after that, he was arraigned before a military commission convened in the Philippines.  He pleaded not guilty, and his trial lasted for two months.  On December 7, 1945, Yamashita was convicted and sentenced to hang.  See <em>id.</em>, at 5; <em>id.</em>, at 31&#x96;34 (Murphy, J., dissenting).  This Court upheld the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The procedures and rules of evidence employed during Yamashita&#x92;s trial departed so far from those used in courts-martial that they generated an unusually long and vociferous critique from two Members of this Court.  See <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;81 (Rutledge, J., joined by Murphy, J., dissenting).<a name="ZO-46ref" href="#ZO-46" class="">
                <sup>

                </sup>
            </a>  Among the dissenters&#x92; primary concerns was that the commission had free rein to consider all evidence &#x93;which in the commission&#x92;s opinion &#x91;would be of assistance in proving or disproving the charge,&#x92; without any of the usual modes of authentication.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 49 (Rutledge, J.).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The majority, however, did not pass on the merits of Yamashita&#x92;s procedural challenges because it concluded that his status disentitled him to any protection under the Articles of War (specifically, those set forth in Article 38, which would become Article 36 of the UCMJ) or the Geneva Convention of 1929, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">47</a>Stat.
2021 (1929 Geneva Convention).  The Court explained that Yamashita was neither a &#x93;person made subject to the Articles of War by Article 2&#x94; thereof, 327 U. S., at 20, nor a protected prisoner of war being tried for crimes committed during his detention, <em>id.</em>, at 21.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At least partially in response to subsequent criticism of General Yamashita&#x92;s trial, the UCMJ&#x92;s codification of the Articles of War after World War II expanded the category of persons subject thereto to include defendants in Yamashita&#x92;s (and Hamdan&#x92;s) position,<a name="ZO-47ref" href="#ZO-47" class="">

            </a> and the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 extended prisoner-of-war protections to individuals tried for crimes committed before their capture.  See 3 Int&#x92;l Comm. of Red Cross,<a name="ZO-48ref" href="#ZO-48" class="">

            </a> Commentary: Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War 413 (1960) (hereinafter GCIII Commentary) (explaining that Article 85, which extends the Convention&#x92;s protections to &#x93;[p]risoners of war prosecuted under the laws of the Detaining Power for acts committed prior to capture,&#x94; was adopted in response to judicial interpretations of the 1929 Convention, including this Court&#x92;s decision in <em>Yamashita</em>).  The most notorious exception to the principle of uniformity, then, has been stripped of its precedential value.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The uniformity principle is not an inflexible one; it does not preclude all departures from the procedures dictated for use by courts-martial.  But any departure must be tailored to the exigency that necessitates it.  See Winthrop 835, n. 81.  That understanding is reflected in Article 36 of the UCMJ, which provides:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(a)The procedure, including modes of proof, in cases before courts-martial, courts of inquiry, military commissions, and other military tribunals may be prescribed by the President by regulations which shall, so far as he considers practicable, apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(b)All rules and regulations made under this article shall be uniform insofar as practicable and shall be reported to Congress.&#x94;  70A Stat. 50.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Article 36 places two restrictions on the President&#x92;s power to promulgate rules of procedure for courts-martial and military commissions alike.  First, no procedural rule he adopts may be &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; the UCMJ&#x97;however practical it may seem.  Second, the rules adopted must be &#x93;uniform insofar as practicable.&#x94;  That is, the rules applied to military commissions must be the same as those applied to courts-martial unless such uniformity proves impracticable.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan argues that Commission Order No. 1 violates both of these restrictions; he maintains that the procedures described in the Commission Order are inconsistent with the UCMJ and that the Government has offered no explanation for their deviation from the procedures governing courts-martial, which are set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2005 ed.) (Manual for Courts-Martial).  Among the inconsistencies Hamdan identifies is that between &#xA7;6 of the Commission Order, which permits exclusion of the accused from proceedings and denial of his access to evidence in certain circumstances, and the UCMJ&#x92;s requirement that &#x93;[a]ll &#x2026; proceedings&#x94; other than votes and deliberations by courts-martial &#x93;shall be made a part of the record and shall be in the presence of the accused.&#x94;  10  U. S. C. A. &#xA7;839(c) (Supp. 2006).  Hamdan also observes that the Commission Order dispenses with virtually all evidentiary rules applicable in courts-martial.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government has three responses.  First, it argues, only 9 of the UCMJ&#x92;s 158 Articles&#x97;the ones that expressly mention &#x93;military commissions&#x94;<a name="ZO-49ref" href="#ZO-49" class="">
                <sup>

                </sup>
            </a>&#x97;actually apply to commissions, and Commission Order No. 1 sets forth no procedure that is &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; those 9 provisions.  Second, the Government contends, military commissions would be of no use if the President were hamstrung by those provisions of the UCMJ that govern courts-martial.  Finally, the President&#x92;s determination that &#x93;the danger to the safety of the United States and the nature of international terrorism&#x94; renders it impracticable &#x93;to apply in military commissions &#x2026; the principles of law and rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts,&#x94; November 13 Order &#xA7;1(f), is, in the Government&#x92;s view, explanation enough for any deviation from court-martial procedures.  See Brief for Respondents 43&#x96;47, and n. 22.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan has the better of this argument.  Without reaching the question whether any provision of Commission Order No. 1 is strictly &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; other provisions of the UCMJ, we conclude that the &#x93;practicability&#x94; determination the President has made is insufficient to justify variances from the procedures governing courts-martial.  Subsection (b) of Article 36 was added after World War II, and requires a different showing of impracticability from the one required by subsection (a).  Subsection (a) requires that the rules the President promulgates for courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions alike conform to those that govern procedures in <em>Article III courts</em>, &#x93;so far as <em>he considers</em> practicable.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/836.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;836(a)</a> (emphasis added).  Subsection (b), by contrast, demands that the rules applied in courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions&#x97;whether or not they conform with the Federal Rules of Evidence&#x97;be &#x93;uniform <em>insofar as practicable</em>.&#x94;  &#xA7;836(b) (emphasis added).  Under the latter provision, then, the rules set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial must apply to military commissions unless impracticable.<a name="ZO-50ref" href="#ZO-50" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the record before us demonstrates that it would be impracticable to apply court-martial rules in this case.  There is no suggestion, for example, of any logistical difficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in applying the usual principles of relevance and admissibility.  Assuming <em>arguendo</em> that the reasons articulated in the President&#x92;s Article 36(a) determination ought to be considered in evaluating the impracticability of applying court-martial rules, the only reason offered in support of that determination is the danger posed by international terrorism.<a name="ZO-52ref" href="#ZO-52" class="">

            </a>  Without for one moment underestimating that danger, it is not evident to us why it should require, in the case of Hamdan&#x92;s trial, any variance from the rules that govern courts-martial.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The absence of any showing of impracticability is particularly disturbing when considered in light of the clear and admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamental protections afforded not just by the Manual for Courts-Martial but also by the UCMJ itself: the right to be present.  See 10  U. S. C. A. &#xA7;839(c) (Supp. 2006).  Whether or not that departure technically is &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; the terms of the UCMJ, 10  U. S. C. &#xA7;836(a), the jettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as &#x93;practicable.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Under the circumstances, then, the rules applicable in courts-martial must apply.  Since it is undisputed that Commission Order No. 1 deviates in many significant respects from those rules, it necessarily violates Article 36(b).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government&#x92;s objection that requiring compliance with the court-martial rules imposes an undue burden both ignores the plain meaning of Article 36(b) and misunderstands the purpose and the history of military commissions.  The military commission was not born of a desire to dispense a more summary form of justice than is afforded by courts-martial; it developed, rather, as a tribunal of necessity to be employed when courts-martial lacked jurisdiction over either the accused or the subject matter.  See Winthrop 831.  Exigency lent the commission its legitimacy, but did not further justify the wholesale jettisoning of procedural protections.  That history explains why the military commission&#x92;s procedures typically have been the ones used by courts-martial.  That the jurisdiction of the two tribunals today may sometimes overlap, see <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 354, does not detract from the force of this history;<a name="ZO-53ref" href="#ZO-53" class="">

Article 36, confirming as much, strikes a careful balance between uniform procedure and the need to accommodate exigencies that may sometimes arise in a theater of war.

, to hold that Hamdan could not invoke the Geneva Conventions to challenge the Government&#x92;s plan to prosecute him in accordance with Commission Order No. 1.  <em>Eisentrager</em> involved a challenge by 21 German nationals to their 1945 convictions for war crimes by a military tribunal convened in Nanking, China, and to their subsequent imprisonment in occupied Germany.  The petitioners argued, <em>inter alia</em>, that the 1929 Geneva Convention rendered illegal some of the procedures employed during their trials, which they said deviated impermissibly from the procedures used by courts-martial to try American soldiers.  See <em>id.</em>, at 789.  We rejected that claim on the merits because the petitioners (unlike Hamdan here) had failed to identify any prejudicial disparity &#x93;between the Commission that tried [them] and those that would try an offending soldier of the American forces of like rank,&#x94; and in any event could claim no protection, under the 1929 Convention, during trials for crimes that occurred before their confinement as prisoners of war.  <em>Id.</em>, at 790.<a name="ZO-56ref" href="#ZO-56" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Buried in a footnote of the opinion, however, is this curious statement suggesting that the Court lacked power even to consider the merits of the Geneva Convention argument:</p>

It is, however, the obvious scheme of the Agreement that responsibility for observance and enforcement of these rights is upon political and military authorities.  Rights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only through protests and intervention of protecting powers as the rights of our citizens against foreign governments are vindicated only by Presidential intervention.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 789, n. 14.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

, they are, as the Government does not dispute, part of the law of war.  See <em>Hamdi, </em>542 U. S., at 520&#x96;521 (plurality opinion).  And compliance with the law of war is the condition upon which the authority set forth in Article 21 is granted.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">ii</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For the Court of Appeals, acknowledgment of that condition was no bar to Hamdan&#x92;s trial by commission.  As an alternative to its holding that Hamdan could not invoke the Geneva Conventions at all, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Conventions did not in any event apply to the armed conflict during which Hamdan was captured.  The court accepted the Executive&#x92;s assertions that Hamdan was captured in connection with the United States&#x92; war with al Qaeda and that that war is distinct from the war with the Taliban in Afghanistan.  It further reasoned that the war with al Qaeda evades the reach of the Geneva Conventions.  See 415 F. 3d, at 41&#x96;42. We, like Judge Williams, disagree with the latter conclusion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The conflict with al Qaeda is not, according to the Government, a conflict to which the full protections afforded detainees under the 1949 Geneva Conventions apply because Article 2 of those Conventions (which appears in all four Conventions) renders the full protections applicable only to &#x93;all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties.&#x94;  6 U.

            </a>  Since Hamdan was captured and detained incident to the conflict with al Qaeda and not the conflict with the Taliban, and since al Qaeda, unlike Afghanistan, is not a &#x93;High Contracting Party&#x94;&#x97;<em>i.e.</em>, a signatory of the Conventions, the protections of those Conventions are not, it is argued, applicable to Hamdan.<a name="ZO-60ref" href="#ZO-60" class="">

One such provision prohibits &#x93;the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals thought, and the Government asserts, that Common Article 3 does not apply to Hamdan because the conflict with al Qaeda, being &#x93; &#x91;international in scope,&#x92; &#x94; does not qualify as a &#x93; &#x91;conflict not of an international character.&#x92; &#x94;  415 F. 3d, at 41.  That reasoning is erroneous.  The term &#x93;conflict not of an international character&#x94; is used here in contradistinction to a conflict between nations.  So much is demonstrated by the &#x93;fundamental logic [of] the Convention&#x92;s provisions on its application.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 44 (Williams, J., concurring).  Common Article 2 provides that &#x93;the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties.&#x94;  6 U. S. T., at 3318 (Art. 2, &#xB6;1).  High Contracting Parties (signatories) also must abide by all terms of the Conventions vis-&amp;Agrave;-vis one another even if one party to the conflict is a nonsignatory &#x93;Power,&#x94; and must so abide vis-&amp;Agrave;-vis the nonsignatory if &#x93;the latter accepts and applies&#x94; those terms.  <em>Ibid.</em> (Art. 2, &#xB6;3).  Common Article 3, by contrast, affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory &#x93;Power&#x94; who are involved in a conflict &#x93;in the territory of&#x94; a signatory.  The latter kind of conflict is distinguishable from the conflict described in Common Article 2 chiefly because it does not involve a clash between nations (whether signatories or not).  In context, then, the phrase &#x93;not of an international character&#x94; bears its literal meaning.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, J. Bentham, Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation 6, 296 (J. Burns &amp; H. Hart eds. 1970) (using the term &#x93;international law&#x94; as a &#x93;new though not inexpressive appellation&#x94; meaning &#x93;betwixt nation and nation&#x94;; defining &#x93;international&#x94; to include &#x93;mutual transactions between sovereigns as such&#x94;); Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, p. 1351 (1987) (&#x93;[A] non-international armed conflict is distinct from an international armed conflict because of the legal status of the entities opposing each other&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Although the official commentaries accompanying Common Article 3 indicate that an important purpose of the provision was to furnish minimal protection to rebels involved in one kind of &#x93;conflict not of an international character,&#x94; <em>i.e.</em>, a civil war, see GCIII Commentary 36&#x96;37, the commentaries also make clear &#x93;that the scope of the Article must be as wide as possible,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 36.<a name="ZO-63ref" href="#ZO-63" class="">

            </a>  In fact, limiting language that would have rendered Common Article 3 applicable &#x93;especially [to] cases of civil war, colonial conflicts, or wars of religion,&#x94; was omitted from the final version of the Article, which coupled broader scope of application with a narrower range of rights than did earlier proposed iterations.

        <p class="opcentered">iii</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Common Article 3, then, is applicable here and, as indicated above, requires that Hamdan be tried by a &#x93;regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.&#x94;  6 U.

Indeed, Bruner itself relied on such other indications&#x96;including a negative inference drawn from the statutory text, cf. infra, at 13&#x96;to support its conclusion that jurisdiction was not available.   The Court observed that (1) Congress had been put on notice by prior lower court cases addressing the Tucker Act that it ought to specifically reserve jurisdiction over pending cases, see 343 U. S., at 115, and (2) in contrast to the congressional silence concerning reservation of jurisdiction, reservation had been made of &#x93; &#x91;any rights or liabilities&#x92; existing at the effective date of the Act&#x94; repealed by another provision of the Act, ibid., n. 7.

Congress deemed that provision insufficient, standing alone, to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable to pending cases; hence its adoption of subsection (h)(2).  Justice Scalia seeks to avoid reducing subsection (h)(2) to a mere redundancy&#x97;a consequence he seems to acknowledge must otherwise follow from his interpretation&#x97;by speculating that Congress had special reasons, not also relevant to subsection (e)(1), to worry that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) would be ruled inapplicable to pending cases.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-10" href="#ZO-10ref">10</a> We note that statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to what the text of the DTA and its drafting history already make plain.  Senator Levin, one of the sponsors of the final bill, objected to earlier versions of the Act&#x92;s &#x93;effective date&#x94; provision that would have made subsection (e)(1) applicable to pending cases.  See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. S12667 (Nov. 10, 2005) (amendment proposed by Sen. Graham that would have rendered what is now subsection (e)(1) applicable to &#x93;any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act&#x94;).  Senator Levin urged adoption of an alternative amendment that &#x93;would apply only to new habeas cases filed after the date of enactment.&#x94;  Id., at S12802 (Nov. 15, 2005).  That alternative amendment became the text of subsection (h)(2).  (In light of the extensive discussion of the DTA&#x92;s effect on pending cases prior to passage of the Act, see, e.g., id., at S12664 (Nov. 10, 2005); id., at S12755 (Nov. 14, 2005); id., at S12799&#x96;S12802 (Nov. 15, 2005); id., at S14245, S14252&#x96;S14253, S14257&#x96;S14258, S14274&#x96;S14275 (Dec. 21, 2005), it cannot be said that the changes to subsection (h)(2) were inconsequential.  Cf. post, at 14 (Scalia, J., dissenting).)


While statements attributed to the final bill&#x92;s two other sponsors, Senators Graham and Kyl, arguably contradict Senator Levin&#x92;s contention that the final version of the Act preserved jurisdiction over pending habeas cases, see 151 Cong. Rec. S14263&#x96;S14264 (Dec. 21, 2005), those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record after the Senate debate.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 5, n. 6; see also 151 Cong. Rec. S14260 (statement of Sen. Kyl) (&#x93;I would like to say a few words about the now-completed National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006&#x94; (emphasis added)).  All statements made during the debate itself support Senator Levin&#x92;s understanding that the final text of the DTA would not render subsection (e)(1) applicable to pending cases.  See, e.g., id., at S14245, S14252&#x96;S14253, S14274&#x96;S14275 (Dec. 21, 2005).  The statements that Justice Scalia cites as evidence to the contrary construe subsection (e)(3) to strip this Court of jurisdiction, see post, at 12, n. 4 (dissenting opinion) (quoting 151 Cong. Rec.

Rec. S12756 (Nov. 14, 2005)), follows directly after the uncontradicted statement of his co-sponsor, Senator Levin, assuring members of the Senate that &#x93;the amendment will not strip the courts of jurisdiction over [pending] cases.&#x94;  Id., at S12755.

S. T. 3316, 3318.  See Part VI, infra.  Although the Court of Appeals rejected the Article 3 argument on the merits, it also stated that, because the challenge was not &#x93;jurisdictional,&#x94; it did not fall within the exception that Schlesinger v. Councilman, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a> (1975)
, recognized for defendants who raise substantial arguments that a military tribunal lacks personal jurisdiction over them.  See 415 F. 3d, at 42.


In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals conflated two distinct inquiries: (1) whether Hamdan has raised a substantial argument that the military commission lacks authority to try him; and, more fundamentally, (2) whether the comity considerations underlying Councilman apply to trigger the abstention principle in the first place.  As the Court of Appeals acknowledged at the beginning of its opinion, the first question warrants consideration only if the answer to the second is yes.  See 415 F. 3d, at 36&#x96;37.  Since, as the Court of Appeals properly concluded, the answer to the second question is in fact no, there is no need to consider any exception.


At any rate, it appears that the exception would apply here.  As discussed in Part VI, infra, Hamdan raises a substantial argument that, because the military commission that has been convened to try him is not a &#x93; &#x91;regularly constituted court&#x92; &#x94; under the Geneva Conventions, it is ultra vires and thus lacks jurisdiction over him.

&#x93;If, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, then, on the theatre of active military operations, where war really prevails, there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society; and as no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course.  As necessity creates the rule, so it limits its duration; for, if this government is continued after the courts are reinstated, it is a gross usurpation of power.  Martial rule can never exist where the courts are open, and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction.  It is also confined to the locality of actual war.&#x94;  4 Wall., at 127 (emphases in original).

Hence, &#x93;military commanders began the practice [during the Civil War] of using the same name, the same rules, and often the same tribunals&#x94; to try both ordinary crimes and war crimes.

But even the Government does not go so far; although the United States had for some time prior to the attacks of September 11, 2001, been aggressively pursuing al Qaeda, neither in the charging document nor in submissions before this Court has the Government asserted that the President&#x92;s war powers were activated prior to September 11, 2001.  Cf. Brief for Respondents 25 (describing the events of September 11, 2001, as &#x93;an act of war&#x94; that &#x93;triggered a right to deploy military forces abroad to defend the United States by combating al Qaeda&#x94;).  Justice Thomas&#x92; further argument that the AUMF is &#x93;backward looking&#x94; and therefore authorizes trial by military commission of crimes that occurred prior to the inception of war is insupportable.  See post, at 8, n. 3.  If nothing else, Article 21 of the UCMJ requires that the President comply with the law of war in his use of military commissions.  As explained in the text, the law of war permits trial only of offenses &#x93;committed within the period of the war.&#x94;  Winthrop 837; see also Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28&#x96;29 (observing that law-of-war military commissions may be used to try &#x93;those enemies who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have violated the law of war&#x94; (emphasis added)).  The sources that Justice Thomas relies on to suggest otherwise simply do not support his position.  Colonel Green&#x92;s short exegesis on military commissions cites Howland for the proposition that &#x93;[o]ffenses committed before a formal declaration of war or before the declaration of martial law may be tried by military commission.&#x94;  The Military Commission, 42 Am. J. Int&#x92;l L. 832, 848 (1948) (emphases added) (cited post, at 9&#x96;10).  Assuming that to be true, nothing in our analysis turns on the admitted absence of either a formal declaration of war or a declaration of martial law.  Our focus instead is on the September 11, 2001 attacks that the Government characterizes as the relevant &#x93;act[s] of war,&#x94; and on the measure that authorized the President&#x92;s deployment of military force&#x97;the AUMF.   Because we do not question the Government&#x92;s position that the war commenced with the events of September 11, 2001, the Prize Cases, 
2Black
635 (1863) (cited post, at 2, 7, 8, and 10 (Thomas, J., dissenting)), are not germane to the analysis.


Finally, Justice Thomas&#x92; assertion that Julius Otto Kuehn&#x92;s trial by military commission &#x93;for conspiring with Japanese officials to betray the United States fleet to the Imperial Japanese Government prior to its attack on Pearl Harbor&#x94; stands as authoritative precedent for Hamdan&#x92;s trial by commission, post, at 9, misses the mark in three critical respects.  First, Kuehn was tried for the federal espionage crimes under what were then 50 U. S C. &#xA7;&#xA7;31, 32, and 34, not with common-law violations of the law of war.  See Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 30, pp. 3067&#x96;3069 (1946).  Second, he was tried by martial law commission (a kind of commission Justice Thomas acknowledges is not relevant to the analysis here, and whose jurisdiction extends to offenses committed within &#x93;the exercise of . . . martial law,&#x94; Winthrop 837, see supra, n. 28), not a commission established exclusively to try violations of the law of war.  See ibid.   Third, the martial law commissions established to try crimes in Hawaii were ultimately declared illegal by this Court.  See Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/304" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 304</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">324</a> (1946)
 (&#x93;The phrase &#x91;martial law&#x92; as employed in [the Hawaiian Organic Act], while intended to authorize the military to act vigorously for the maintenance of an orderly civil government and for the defense of the Islands against actual or threatened rebellion or invasion, was not intended to authorize the supplanting of courts by military tribunals&#x94;).
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-32" href="#ZO-32ref">32</a> Justice Thomas adopts the remarkable view, not advocated by the Government, that the charging document in this case actually includes more than one charge: Conspiracy and several other ill-defined crimes, like &#x93;joining an organization&#x94; that has a criminal purpose, &#x93; &#x91;[b]eing a guerilla,&#x92; &#x94; and aiding the enemy.  See post, at 16&#x96;21, and n. 9.  There are innumerable problems with this approach.


First, the crimes Justice Thomas identifies were not actually charged.  It is one thing to observe that charges before a military commission &#x93; &#x91;need not be stated with the precision of a common law indictment,&#x92; &#x94; post, at 15, n. 7 (citation omitted); it is quite another to say that a crime not charged may nonetheless be read into an indictment.   Second, the Government plainly had available to it the tools and the time it needed to charge petitioner with the various crimes Justice Thomas refers to, if it believed they were supported by the allegations.  As Justice Thomas himself observes, see post, at 21, the crime of aiding the enemy may, in circumstances where the accused owes allegiance to the party whose enemy he is alleged to have aided, be triable by military commission pursuant to Article 104 of the UCMJ, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/904.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;904</a>.  Indeed, the Government has charged detainees under this provision when it has seen fit to do so.  See Brief for David Hicks as Amicus Curiae 7.


Third, the cases Justice Thomas relies on to show that Hamdan may be guilty of violations of the law of war not actually charged do not support his argument.  Justice Thomas begins by blurring the distinction between those categories of &#x93;offender&#x94; who may be tried by military commission (e.g., jayhawkers and the like) with the &#x93;offenses&#x94; that may be so tried.  Even when it comes to &#x93; &#x91;being a guerilla,&#x92; &#x94; cf. post, at 18, n. 9 (citation omitted), a label alone does not render a person susceptible to execution or other criminal punishment; the charge of &#x93; &#x91;being a guerilla&#x92; &#x94; invariably is accompanied by the allegation that the defendant &#x93; &#x91;took up arms&#x92; &#x94; as such.  This is because, as explained by Judge Advocate General Holt in a decision upholding the charge of &#x93; &#x91;being a guerilla&#x92; &#x94; as one recognized by &#x93;the universal usage of the times,&#x94; the charge is simply shorthand (akin to &#x93;being a spy&#x94;) for &#x93;the perpetration of a succession of similar acts&#x94; of violence.  Record Books of the Judge Advocate General Office, R. 3, 590.   The sources cited by Justice Thomas confirm as much.  See cases cited post, at 18, n. 9.


Likewise, the suggestion that the Nuremberg precedents support Hamdan&#x92;s conviction for the (uncharged) crime of joining a criminal organization must fail.  Cf. post, at 19&#x96;21.  The convictions of certain high-level Nazi officials for &#x93;membership in a criminal organization&#x94; were secured pursuant to specific provisions of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal that permitted indictment of individual organization members following convictions of the organizations themselves.  See Arts. 9 and 10, in 1 Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal 12 (1947).   The initial plan to use organizations&#x92; convictions as predicates for mass individual trials ultimately was abandoned.  See T. Taylor, Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir 584&#x96;585, 638 (1992).

W. Rehnquist, All the Laws But One: Civil Liberties in Wartime 165&#x96;167 (1998) (analyzing the conspiracy charges in light of ordinary criminal law principles at the time), is at best an equivocal exception.  Although the charge against the defendants in that case accused them of &#x93;combining, confederating, and conspiring together&#x94; to murder the President, they were also charged (as we read the indictment, cf. post, at 23, n. 14 (Thomas, J., dissenting)) with &#x93;maliciously, unlawfully, and traitorously murdering the said Abraham Lincoln.&#x94;  H.

The charge against Lenger Grenfel and others for conspiring to release rebel prisoners held in Chicago only supports the observation, made in the text, that the Civil War tribunals often charged hybrid crimes mixing elements of crimes ordinarily triable in civilian courts (like treason) and violations of the law of war.  Judge Advocate General Holt, in recommending that Grenfel&#x92;s death sentence be upheld (it was in fact commuted by Presidential decree, see H. R. Doc.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), drawing on the Nuremberg precedents, has adopted a &#x93;joint criminal enterprise&#x94; theory of liability, but that is a species of liability for the substantive offense (akin to aiding and abetting), not a crime on its own.

But even if Congress was concerned with ensuring uniformity across service branches, that does not mean it did not also intend to codify the longstanding practice of procedural parity between courts-martial and other military tribunals.  Indeed, the suggestion that Congress did not intend uniformity across tribunal types is belied by the textual proximity of subsection (a) (which requires that the rules governing criminal trials in federal district courts apply, absent the President&#x92;s determination of impracticability, to courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions alike) and subsection (b) (which imposes the uniformity requirement).

            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Stevens</span> announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I through IV, Parts VI through VI&#x96;D&#x96;iii, Part VI&#x96;D&#x96;v, and Part VII, and an opinion with respect to Parts V and VI&#x96;D&#x96;iv, in which <span class="smallcaps">Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, </span>and <span class="smallcaps">Justice Breyer</span> join.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni national, is in custody at an American prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  In November 2001, during hostilities between the United States and the Taliban (which then governed Afghanistan), Hamdan was captured by militia forces and turned over to the U. S. military.  In June 2002, he was transported to Guantanamo Bay.  Over a year later, the President deemed him eligible for trial by military commission for then-unspecified crimes.  After another year had passed, Hamdan was charged with one count of conspiracy &#x93;to commit &#x2026; offenses triable by military commission.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus and mandamus to challenge the Executive Branch&#x92;s intended means of prosecuting this charge.  He concedes that a court-martial constituted in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/801.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;801</a>
            <em>et seq.</em> (2000 ed. and Supp. III), would have authority to try him.  His objection is that the military commission the President has convened lacks such authority, for two principal reasons: First, neither congressional Act nor the common law of war supports trial by this commission for the crime of conspiracy&#x97;an offense that, Hamdan says, is not a violation of the law of war.  Second, Hamdan contends, the procedures that the President has adopted to try him violate the most basic tenets of military and international law, including the principle that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear the evidence against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The District Court granted Hamdan&#x92;s request for a writ of habeas corpus.  344 F. Supp. 2d 152 (DC 2004).  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  415 F. 3d 33 (2005).  Recognizing, as we did over a half-century ago, that trial by military commission is an extraordinary measure raising important questions about the balance of powers in our constitutional structure, <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>

, we granted certiorari.  546 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the military commission convened to try Hamdan lacks power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the Geneva Conventions.  Four of us also conclude, see Part V, <em>infra</em>, that the offense with which Hamdan has been charged is not an &#x93;offens[e] that by &#x2026; the law of war may be tried by military commissions.&#x94;  10  U.

        <p class="bodytext">    On September 11, 2001, agents of the al Qaeda terrorist organization hijacked commercial airplanes and attacked the World Trade Center in New York City and the national headquarters of the Department of Defense in Arlington, Virginia.  Americans will never forget the devastation wrought by these acts.  Nearly 3,000 civilians were killed.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Congress responded by adopting a Joint Resolution authorizing the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks &#x2026; in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF),

224, note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1541.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. &#xA7;1541</a> (2000 ed., Supp. III).  Acting pursuant to the AUMF, and having determined that the Taliban regime had supported al Qaeda, the President ordered the Armed Forces of the United States to invade Afghanistan.  In the ensuing hostilities, hundreds of individuals, Hamdan among them, were captured and eventually detained at Guantanamo Bay.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On November 13, 2001, while the United States was still engaged in active combat with the Taliban, the President issued a comprehensive military order intended to govern the &#x93;Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,&#x94; 66 Fed. Reg. 57833 (hereinafter November 13 Order or Order).  Those subject to the November 13 Order include any noncitizen for whom the President determines &#x93;there is reason to believe&#x94; that he or she (1) &#x93;is or was&#x94; a member of al Qaeda or (2) has engaged or participated in terrorist activities aimed at or harmful to the United States.  <em>Id.</em>, at 57834.  Any such individual &#x93;shall, when tried, be tried by military commission for any and all offenses triable by military commission that such individual is alleged to have committed, and may be punished in accordance with the penalties provided under applicable law, including imprisonment or death.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  The November 13 Order vested in the Secretary of Defense the power to appoint military commissions to try individuals subject to the Order, but that power has since been delegated to John D. Altenberg, Jr., a retired Army major general and longtime military lawyer who has been designated &#x93;Appointing Authority for Military Commissions.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On July 3, 2003, the President announced his determination that Hamdan and five other detainees at Guantanamo Bay were subject to the November 13 Order and thus triable by military commission.  In December 2003, military counsel was appointed to represent Hamdan.  Two months later, counsel filed demands for charges and for a speedy trial pursuant to Article 10 of the UCMJ, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/810.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;810</a>.  On February 23, 2004, the legal adviser to the Appointing Authority denied the applications, ruling that Hamdan was not entitled to any of the protections of the UCMJ.  Not until July 13, 2004, after Hamdan had commenced this action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, did the Government finally charge him with the offense for which, a year earlier, he had been deemed eligible for trial by military commission.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The charging document, which is unsigned, contains 13 numbered paragraphs.  The first two paragraphs recite the asserted bases for the military commission&#x92;s jurisdiction&#x97;namely, the November 13 Order and the President&#x92;s July 3, 2003, declaration that Hamdan is eligible for trial by military commission.  The next nine paragraphs, collectively entitled &#x93;General Allegations,&#x94; describe al Qaeda&#x92;s activities from its inception in 1989 through 2001 and identify Osama bin Laden as the group&#x92;s leader.  Hamdan is not mentioned in these paragraphs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Only the final two paragraphs, entitled &#x93;Charge: Conspiracy,&#x94; contain allegations against Hamdan.  Paragraph 12 charges that &#x93;from on or about February 1996 to on or about November 24, 2001,&#x94; Hamdan &#x93;willfully and knowingly joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose and conspired and agreed with [named members of al Qaeda] to commit the following offenses triable by military commission: attacking civilians; attacking civilian objects; murder by an unprivileged belligerent; and terrorism.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.  There is no allegation that Hamdan had any command responsibilities, played a leadership role, or participated in the planning of any activity.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Paragraph 13 lists four &#x93;overt acts&#x94; that Hamdan is alleged to have committed sometime between 1996 and November 2001 in furtherance of the &#x93;enterprise and conspiracy&#x94;: (1) he acted as Osama bin Laden&#x92;s &#x93;bodyguard and personal driver,&#x94; &#x93;believ[ing]&#x94; all the while that bin Laden &#x93;and his associates were involved in&#x94; terrorist acts prior to and including the attacks of September 11, 2001; (2) he arranged for transportation of, and actually transported, weapons used by al Qaeda members and by bin Laden&#x92;s bodyguards (Hamdan among them); (3) he &#x93;drove or accompanied [O]sama bin Laden to various al Qaida-sponsored training camps, press conferences, or lectures,&#x94; at which bin Laden encouraged attacks against Americans; and (4) he received weapons training at al Qaeda-sponsored camps.  <em>Id.</em>, at 65a&#x96;67a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After this formal charge was filed, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington transferred Hamdan&#x92;s habeas and mandamus petitions to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  Meanwhile, a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) convened pursuant to a military order issued on July 7, 2004, decided that Hamdan&#x92;s continued detention at Guantanamo Bay was warranted because he was an &#x93;enemy combatant.&#x94;<a name="ZO-1ref" href="#ZO-1" class="">

            </a>  Separately, proceedings before the military commission commenced.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On November 8, 2004, however, the District Court granted Hamdan&#x92;s petition for habeas corpus and stayed the commission&#x92;s proceedings.  It concluded that the President&#x92;s authority to establish military commissions extends only to &#x93;offenders or offenses triable by military [commission] under the law of war,&#x94; 344 F. Supp. 2d, at 158; that the law of war includes the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, T. I. A. S. No. 3364 (Third Geneva Convention); that Hamdan is entitled to the full protections of the Third Geneva Convention until adjudged, in compliance with that treaty, not to be a prisoner of war; and that, whether or not Hamdan is properly classified as a prisoner of war, the military commission convened to try him was established in violation of both the UCMJ and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva Convention because it had the power to convict based on evidence the accused would never see or hear.  344 F. Supp. 2d, at 158&#x96;172.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals declined the Government&#x92;s invitation to abstain from considering Hamdan&#x92;s challenge.  Cf. <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a> (1975)
.  On the merits, the panel rejected the District Court&#x92;s further conclusion that Hamdan was entitled to relief under the Third Geneva Convention.  All three judges agreed that the Geneva Conventions were not &#x93;judicially enforceable,&#x94; 415 F. 3d, at 38, and two thought that the Conventions did not in any event apply to Hamdan, <em>id.</em>, at 40&#x96;42; but see <em>id.</em>, at 44 (Williams, J., concurring).  In other portions of its opinion, the court concluded that our decision in <em>Quirin</em> foreclosed any separation-of-powers objection to the military commission&#x92;s jurisdiction, and held that Hamdan&#x92;s trial before the contemplated commission would violate neither the UCMJ nor U. S. Armed Forces regulations intended to implement the Geneva Conventions.  415 F. 3d, at 38, 42&#x96;43.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On November 7, 2005, we granted certiorari to decide whether the military commission convened to try Hamdan has authority to do so, and whether Hamdan may rely on the Geneva Conventions in these proceedings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On February 13, 2006, the Government filed a motion to dismiss the writ of certiorari.  The ground cited for dismissal was the recently enacted Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), Pub. L. 109&#x96;148, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2739.  We postponed our ruling on that motion pending argument on the merits, 546 U. S. ___ (2006), and now deny it.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The DTA, which was signed into law on December 30, 2005, addresses a broad swath of subjects related to detainees.  It places restrictions on the treatment and interrogation of detainees in U. S. custody, and it furnishes procedural protections for U. S. personnel accused of engaging in improper interrogation.  DTA &#xA7;&#xA7;1002&#x96;1004, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.

Subsections (a) through (d) of &#xA7;1005 direct the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the procedures being used by CSRTs to determine the proper classification of detainees held in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and to adopt certain safeguards as part of those procedures.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Subsection (e) of &#xA7;1005, which is entitled &#x93;<span class="smallcaps">Judicial Review of Detention of Enemy Combatants</span>,&#x94; supplies the basis for the Government&#x92;s jurisdictional argument.

        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan objects to this theory on both constitutional and statutory grounds.  Principal among his constitutional arguments is that the Government&#x92;s preferred reading raises grave questions about Congress&#x92; authority to impinge upon this Court&#x92;s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases.  Support for this argument is drawn from <em>Ex parte Yerger,</em>8Wall.

        <p class="bodytext">    We find it unnecessary to reach either of these arguments.  Ordinary principles of statutory construction suffice to rebut the Government&#x92;s theory&#x97;at least insofar as this case, which was pending at the time the DTA was enacted, is concerned.</p>

            </a>  A familiar principle of statutory construction, relevant both in <em>Lindh</em> and here, is that a negative inference may be drawn from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute.

 (&#x93; &#x91;[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion&#x92; &#x94;).  The Court in <em>Lindh</em> relied on this reasoning to conclude that certain limitations on the availability of habeas relief imposed by AEDPA applied only to cases filed after that statute&#x92;s effective date.  Congress&#x92; failure to identify the temporal reach of those limitations, which governed noncapital cases, stood in contrast to its express command in the same legislation that new rules governing habeas petitions in capital cases &#x93;apply to cases pending on or after the date of enactment.&#x94;  &#xA7;107(c), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
1226; see <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329&#x96;330.  That contrast, combined with the fact that the amendments at issue &#x93;affect[ed] substantive entitlement to relief,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 327, warranted drawing a negative inference.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A like inference follows <em>a fortiori </em>from <em>Lindh</em> in this case.  &#x93;If &#x2026; Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure that [&#xA7;&#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)] be applied to pending cases, it should have been just as concerned about [&#xA7;1005(e)(1)], unless it had the different intent that the latter [section] not be applied to the general run of pending cases.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  If anything, the evidence of deliberate omission is stronger here than it was in <em>Lindh</em>.  In <em>Lindh</em>, the provisions to be contrasted had been drafted separately but were later &#x93;joined together and &#x2026; considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 330.  We observed that Congress&#x92; tandem review and approval of the two sets of provisions strengthened the presumption that the relevant omission was deliberate.  <em>Id.</em>, at 331; see also <em>Field</em> v. <em>Mans,</em>

 (&#x93;The more apparently deliberate the contrast, the stronger the inference, as applied, for example, to contrasting statutory sections originally enacted simultaneously in relevant respects&#x94;).  Here, Congress not only considered the respective temporal reaches of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (e) together at every stage, but omitted paragraph (1) from its directive that paragraphs (2) and (3) apply to pending cases only after having <em>rejected</em> earlier proposed versions of the statute that would have included what is now paragraph (1) within the scope of that directive.

        <p class="bodytext">    The Government nonetheless offers two reasons why, in its view, no negative inference may be drawn in favor of jurisdiction.  First, it asserts that <em>Lindh</em> is inapposite because &#x93;Section 1005(e)(1) and (h)(1) remove jurisdiction, while Section 1005(e)(2), (3) and (h)(2) create an exclusive review mechanism and define the nature of that review.&#x94;  Reply Brief in Support of Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss 4.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">356</a> (1999)
, the Government argues, Congress&#x92; different treatment of them is of no significance.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This argument must fail because it rests on a false distinction between the &#x93;jurisdictional&#x94; nature of subsection (e)(1) and the &#x93;procedural&#x94; character of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3).  In truth, all three provisions govern jurisdiction over detainees&#x92; claims; subsection (e)(1) addresses jurisdiction in habeas cases and other actions &#x93;relating to any aspect of the detention,&#x94; while subsections (e)(2) and (3) vest exclusive,<a name="ZO-11ref" href="#ZO-11" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    That subsection (e)(1) strips jurisdiction while subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) restore it in limited form is hardly a distinction upon which a negative inference must founder.  <span class="smallcaps">Justice Scalia</span>, in arguing to the contrary, maintains that Congress had &#x93;ample reason&#x94; to provide explicitly for application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) to pending cases because &#x93;jurisdiction-stripping&#x94; provisions like subsection (e)(1) have been treated differently under our retroactivity jurisprudence than &#x93;jurisdiction-conferring&#x94; ones like subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3).  <em>Post</em>, at 8 (dissenting opinion); see also Reply Brief in Support of Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss 5&#x96;6.

            </a>  Moreover, it strains credulity to suggest that the desire to reinforce the application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) to pending cases drove Congress to <em>exclude</em> subsection (e)(1) from &#xA7;1005(h)(2).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government&#x92;s second objection is that applying subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) but not (e)(1) to pending cases &#x93;produces an absurd result&#x94; because it grants (albeit only temporarily) dual jurisdiction over detainees&#x92; cases in circumstances where the statute plainly envisions that the District of Columbia Circuit will have &#x93;<em>exclusive</em>&#x94; and immediate jurisdiction over such cases.  Reply Brief in Support of Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss 7.  But the premise here is faulty; subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) grant jurisdiction only over actions to &#x93;determine the validity of any final decision&#x94; of a CSRT or commission.  Because Hamdan, at least, is not contesting any &#x93;final decision&#x94; of a CSRT or military commission, his action does not fall within the scope of subsection (e)(2) or (e)(3).  There is, then, no absurdity.<a name="ZO-14ref" href="#ZO-14" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The Government&#x92;s more general suggestion that Congress can have had no good reason for preserving habeas jurisdiction over cases that had been brought by detainees prior to enactment of the DTA not only is belied by the legislative history, see n. 10, <em>supra</em>, but is otherwise without merit.  There is nothing absurd about a scheme under which pending habeas actions&#x97;particularly those, like this one, that challenge the very legitimacy of the tribunals whose judgments Congress would like to have reviewed&#x97;are preserved, and more routine challenges to final decisions rendered by those tribunals are carefully channeled to a particular court and through a particular lens of review.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, we cannot leave unaddressed <span class="smallcaps">Justice Scalia</span>&#x92;s contentions that the &#x93;meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear,&#x94; <em>post</em>, at 6, and that &#x93;the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed,&#x94; <em>post</em>, at 3 (emphasis in original).  Only by treating the <em>Bruner</em> rule as an inflexible trump (a thing it has never been, see n. 7, <em>supra</em>) and ignoring both the rest of &#xA7;1005&#x92;s text and its drafting history can one conclude as much.  Congress here expressly provided that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applied to pending cases.  It chose not to so provide&#x97;after having been presented with the option&#x97;for subsection (e)(1).  The omission is an integral part of the statutory scheme that muddies whatever &#x93;plain meaning&#x94; may be discerned from blinkered study of subsection (e)(1) alone.  The dissent&#x92;s speculation about what Congress might have intended by the omission not only is counterfactual, cf. n. 10, <em>supra</em> (recounting legislative history), but rests on both a misconstruction of the DTA and an erroneous view our precedents, see <em>supra</em>, at 17, and n. 12.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    The same cannot be said here; indeed, neither of the comity considerations identified in <em>Councilman </em>weighs in favor of abstention in this case.  First, Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.  Second, the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.  Unlike the officer in <em>Councilman</em>,<em/>Hamdan has no right to appeal any conviction to the civilian judges of the Court of Military Appeals (now called the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, see Pub. L. 103&#x96;337,

Instead, under Dept. of Defense Military Commission Order No. 1 (Commission Order No. 1), which was issued by the President on March 21, 2002, and amended most recently on August 31, 2005, and which governs the procedures for Hamdan&#x92;s commission, any conviction would be reviewed by a panel consisting of three military officers designated by the Secretary of Defense.  Commission Order No. 1 &#xA7;6(H)(4).  Commission Order No. 1 provides that appeal of a review panel&#x92;s decision may be had only to the Secretary of Defense himself, &#xA7;6(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, &#xA7;6(H)(6).<a name="ZO-18ref" href="#ZO-18" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, neither of the two comity considerations underlying our decision to abstain in <em>Councilman</em> applies to the circumstances of this case.  Instead, this Court&#x92;s decision in <em>Quirin</em> is the most relevant precedent.  In <em>Quirin</em>, seven German saboteurs were captured upon arrival by submarine in New York and Florida.  317 U. S., at 21.  The President convened a military commission to try the saboteurs, who then filed habeas corpus petitions in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging their trial by commission.  We granted the saboteurs&#x92; petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals before judgment.  See <em>id.</em>, at 19.  Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.  That course of action was warranted, we explained, &#x93;[i]n view of the public importance of the questions raised by [the cases] and of the duty which rests on the courts, in time of war as well as in time of peace, to preserve unimpaired the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty, and because in our opinion the public interest required that we consider and decide those questions without any avoidable delay.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As the Court of Appeals here recognized, <em>Quirin </em>&#x93;provides a compelling historical precedent for the power of civilian courts to entertain challenges that seek to interrupt the processes of military commissions.&#x94;  415 F. 3d, at 36.<a name="ZO-20ref" href="#ZO-20" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the Government has identified no other &#x93;important countervailing interest&#x94; that would permit federal courts to depart from their general &#x93;duty to exercise the jurisdiction that is conferred upon them by Congress.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 716 (majority opinion).  To the contrary, Hamdan and the Government both have a compelling interest in knowing in advance whether Hamdan may be tried by a military commission that arguably is without any basis in law and operates free from many of the procedural rules prescribed by Congress for courts-martial&#x97;rules intended to safeguard the accused and ensure the reliability of any conviction.  While we certainly do not foreclose the possibility that abstention may be appropriate in some cases seeking review of ongoing military commission proceedings (such as military commissions convened on the battlefield), the foregoing discussion makes clear that, under our precedent, abstention is not justified here.  We therefore proceed to consider the merits of Hamdan&#x92;s challenge.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The military commission, a tribunal neither mentioned in the Constitution nor created by statute, was born of military necessity.  See W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 831 (rev. 2d ed. 1920) (hereinafter Winthrop).  Though foreshadowed in some respects by earlier tribunals like the Board of General Officers that General Washington convened to try British Major John Andr&#xE9; for spying during the Revolutionary War, the commission &#x93;as such&#x94; was inaugurated in 1847.  <em>Id.</em>, at 832; G. Davis, A Treatise on the Military Law of the United States 308 (2d ed. 1909) (hereinafter Davis).  As commander of occupied Mexican territory, and having available to him no other tribunal, General Winfield Scott that year ordered the establishment of both &#x93; &#x91;<em>military commissions</em>&#x92; &#x94; to try ordinary crimes committed in the occupied territory and a &#x93;<em>council of war</em>&#x94; to try offenses against the law of war.  Winthrop 832 (emphases in original).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When the exigencies of war next gave rise to a need for use of military commissions, during the Civil War, the dual system favored by General Scott was not adopted.  Instead, a single tribunal often took jurisdiction over ordinary crimes, war crimes, and breaches of military orders alike.  As further discussed below, each aspect of that seemingly broad jurisdiction was in fact supported by a separate military exigency.  Generally, though, the need for military commissions during this period&#x97;as during the Mexican War&#x97;was driven largely by the then very limited jurisdiction of courts-martial: &#x93;The <em>occasion</em> for the military commission arises principally from the fact that the jurisdiction of the court-martial proper, in our law, is restricted by statute almost exclusively to members of the military force and to certain specific offences defined in a written code.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 831 (emphasis in original).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Exigency alone, of course, will not justify the establishment and use of penal tribunals not contemplated by Article I, &#xA7;8 and Article III, &#xA7;1 of the Constitution unless some other part of that document authorizes a response to the felt need.

But neither can the President, in war more than in peace, intrude upon the proper authority of Congress, nor Congress upon the proper authority of the President&#x2026; . Congress cannot direct the conduct of campaigns, nor can the President, or any commander under him, without the sanction of Congress, institute tribunals for the trial and punishment of offences, either of soldiers or civilians, unless in cases of a controlling necessity, which justifies what it compels, or at least insures acts of indemnity from the justice of the legislature.&#x94;  4 Wall., at 139&#x96;140.<a name="ZO-21ref" href="#ZO-21" class="">

For we held in <em>Quirin </em>that Congress had, through Article of War 15, sanctioned the use of military commissions in such circumstances.  317 U.

Contrary to the Government&#x92;s assertion, however, even <em>Quirin</em> did not view the authorization as a sweeping mandate for the President to &#x93;invoke military commissions when he deems them necessary.&#x94;  Brief for Respondents 17.  Rather, the <em>Quirin</em> Court recognized that Congress had simply preserved what power, under the Constitution and the common law of war, the President had had before 1916 to convene military commissions&#x97;with the express condition that the President and those under his command comply with the law of war.

            </a>  That much is evidenced by the Court&#x92;s inquiry, <em>following</em> its conclusion that Congress had authorized military commissions, into whether the law of war had indeed been complied with in that case.  See ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">The Government would have us dispense with the inquiry that the Quirin Court undertook and find in either the AUMF or the DTA specific, overriding authorization for the very commission that has been convened to try Hamdan.  Neither of these congressional Acts, however, expands the President&#x92;s authority to convene military commissions.  First, while we assume that the AUMF activated the President&#x92;s war powers, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>,<em/>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/507" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 507</a> (2004)

S., at 11, there is nothing in the text or legislative history of the AUMF even hinting that Congress intended to expand or alter the authorization set forth in Article 21 of the UCMJ.

        <p class="bodytext">    Likewise, the DTA cannot be read to authorize this commission.  Although the DTA, unlike either Article 21 or the AUMF, was enacted after the President had convened Hamdan&#x92;s commission, it contains no language authorizing that tribunal or any other at Guantanamo Bay.  The DTA obviously &#x93;recognize[s]&#x94; the existence of the Guantanamo Bay commissions in the weakest sense, Brief for Respondents 15, because it references some of the military orders governing them and creates limited judicial review of their &#x93;final decision[s],&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3),

2743.  But the statute also pointedly reserves judgment on whether &#x93;the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable&#x94; in reviewing such decisions and whether, if they are, the &#x93;standards and procedures&#x94; used to try Hamdan and other detainees actually violate the &#x93;Constitution and laws.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Together, the UCMJ, the AUMF, and the DTA at most acknowledge a general Presidential authority to convene military commissions in circumstances where justified under the &#x93;Constitution and laws,&#x94; including the law of war.  Absent a more specific congressional authorization, the task of this Court is, as it was in Quirin, to decide whether Hamdan&#x92;s military commission is so justified.  It is to that inquiry we now turn.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    The common law governing military commissions may be gleaned from past practice and what sparse legal precedent exists.

None of the overt acts that Hamdan is alleged to have committed violates the law of war.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These facts alone cast doubt on the legality of the charge and, hence, the commission; as Winthrop makes plain, the offense alleged must have been committed both in a theater of war and <em>during</em>, not before, the relevant conflict.  But the deficiencies in the time and place allegations also underscore&#x97;indeed are symptomatic of&#x97;the most serious defect of this charge: The offense it alleges is not triable by law-of-war military commission.  See <em>Yamashita</em>, 327 U.

            </a>  Winthrop explains that under the common law governing military commissions, it is not enough to intend to violate the law of war and commit overt acts in furtherance of that intention unless the overt acts either are themselves offenses against the law of war or constitute steps sufficiently substantial to qualify as an attempt.  See Winthrop 841 (&#x93;[T]he jurisdiction of the military commission should be restricted to cases of offence consisting in <em>overt acts</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, in unlawful commissions or actual attempts to commit, and not in intentions merely&#x94; (emphasis in original)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government cites three sources that it says show otherwise.  First, it points out that the Nazi saboteurs in <em>Quirin</em> were charged with conspiracy.  See Brief for Respondents 27.  Second, it observes that Winthrop at one point in his treatise identifies conspiracy as an offense &#x93;prosecuted by military commissions.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing Winthrop 839, and n. 5).  Finally, it notes that another military historian, Charles Roscoe Howland, lists conspiracy &#x93; &#x91;to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the enemy&#x92; &#x94; as an offense that was tried as a violation of the law of war during the Civil War.  Brief for Respondents 27&#x96;28 (citing C. Howland, Digest of Opinions of the Judge Advocates General of the Army 1071 (1912) (hereinafter Howland)).  On close analysis, however, these sources at best lend little support to the Government&#x92;s position and at worst undermine it.  By any measure, they fail to satisfy the high standard of clarity required to justify the use of a military commission.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    That the defendants in <em>Quirin</em> were charged with conspiracy is not persuasive, since the Court declined to address whether the offense actually qualified as a violation of the law of war&#x97;let alone one triable by military commission.  The <em>Quirin</em> defendants were charged with the following offenses:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;[I.]Violation of the law of war.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

&#x93;[II.]Violation of Article 81 of the Articles of War, defining the offense of relieving or attempting to relieve, or corresponding with or giving intelligence to, the enemy.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

&#x93;[III.]Violation of Article 82, defining the offense of spying.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

&#x93;[IV.]Conspiracy to commit the offenses alleged in charges [I, II, and III].&#x94;  317 U. S., at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The Government, defending its charge, argued that the conspiracy alleged &#x93;constitute[d] an additional violation of the law of war.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  The saboteurs disagreed; they maintained that &#x93;[t]he charge of conspiracy can not stand if the other charges fall.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 8.  The Court, however, declined to resolve the dispute.  It concluded, first, that the specification supporting Charge I adequately alleged a &#x93;violation of the law of war&#x94; that was not &#x93;merely colorable or without foundation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 36.  The facts the Court deemed sufficient for this purpose were that the defendants, admitted enemy combatants, entered upon U. S. territory in time of war without uniform &#x93;for the purpose of destroying property used or useful in prosecuting the war.&#x94;  That act was &#x93;a hostile and warlike&#x94; one.  <em>Id.</em>, at 36, 37.  The Court was careful in its decision to identify an overt, &#x93;complete&#x94; act.  Responding to the argument that the saboteurs had &#x93;not actually committed or attempted to commit any act of depredation or entered the theatre or zone of active military operations&#x94; and therefore had not violated the law of war, the Court responded that they had actually &#x93;passed our military and naval lines and defenses or went behind those lines, in civilian dress and with hostile purpose.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 38.  &#x93;The offense was complete when with that purpose they entered&#x97;or, having so entered, they remained upon&#x97;our territory in time of war without uniform or other appropriate means of identification.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Turning to the other charges alleged, the Court explained that &#x93;[s]ince the first specification of Charge I sets forth a violation of the law of war, we have no occasion to pass on the adequacy of the second specification of Charge I, or to construe the 81st and 82nd Articles of War for the purpose of ascertaining whether the specifications under Charges II and III allege violations of those Articles or whether if so construed they are constitutional.&#x94;  Id., at 46.  No mention was made at all of Charge IV&#x97;the conspiracy charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If anything, <em>Quirin</em> supports Hamdan&#x92;s argument that conspiracy is not a violation of the law of war.  Not only did the Court pointedly omit any discussion of the conspiracy charge, but its analysis of Charge I placed special emphasis on the <em>completion</em> of an offense; it took seriously the saboteurs&#x92; argument that there can be no violation of a law of war&#x97;at least not one triable by military commission&#x97;without the actual commission of or attempt to commit a &#x93;hostile and warlike act.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 37&#x96;38.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    That limitation makes eminent sense when one considers the necessity from whence this kind of military commission grew: The need to dispense swift justice, often in the form of execution, to illegal belligerents captured on the battlefield.  See S. Rep. No. 130, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 40 (1916) (testimony of Brig. Gen. Enoch H. Crowder) (observing that Article of War 15 preserves the power of &#x93;the military commander <em>in the field in time of war</em>&#x94; to use military commissions (emphasis added)).  The same urgency would not have been felt vis-&amp;Agrave;-vis enemies who had done little more than agree to violate the laws of war.  Cf. 
31Op. Atty. Gen.
356,
357,
361 (1918) (opining that a German spy could not be tried by military commission because, having been apprehended before entering &#x93;any camp, fortification or other military premises of the United States,&#x94; he had &#x93;committed [his offenses] outside of the field of military operations&#x94;).  The <em>Quirin</em> Court acknowledged as much when it described the President&#x92;s authority to use law-of-war military commissions as the power to &#x93;seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies <em>who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort</em> have violated the law of war.&#x94;  317 U. S., at 28&#x96;29 (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Winthrop and Howland are only superficially more helpful to the Government.  Howland, granted, lists &#x93;conspiracy by two or more to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the enemy&#x94; as one of over 20 &#x93;offenses against the laws and usages of war&#x94; &#x93;passed upon and punished by military commissions.&#x94;  Howland 1071.  But while the records of cases that Howland cites following his list of offenses against the law of war support inclusion of the other offenses mentioned, they provide no support for the inclusion of conspiracy as a violation of the law of war.  See <em>ibid.</em> (citing Record Books of the Judge Advocate General Office, R. 2, 144; R. 3, 401, 589, 649; R. 4, 320; R. 5, 36, 590; R. 6, 20; R. 7, 413; R. 8, 529; R. 9, 149, 202, 225, 481, 524, 535; R. 10, 567; R. 11, 473, 513; R. 13, 125, 675; R. 16, 446; R. 21, 101, 280).  Winthrop, apparently recognizing as much, excludes conspiracy of any kind from his own list of offenses against the law of war.  See Winthrop 839&#x96;840.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Winthrop does, unsurprisingly, include &#x93;criminal conspiracies&#x94; in his list of &#x93;[c]rimes and statutory offenses cognizable by State or U. S. courts&#x94; and triable by martial law or military government commission.  See <em>id.</em>, at 839.  And, in a footnote, he cites several Civil War examples of &#x93;conspiracies of this class, <em>or of the first and second classes combined</em>.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 839, n. 5 (emphasis added).  The Government relies on this footnote for its contention that conspiracy was triable both as an ordinary crime (a crime of the &#x93;first class&#x94;) and, independently, as a war crime (a crime of the &#x93;second class&#x94;).  But the footnote will not support the weight the Government places on it.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As we have seen, the military commissions convened during the Civil War functioned at once as martial law or military government tribunals and as law-of-war commissions.  See n. 27, <em>supra</em>.  Accordingly, they regularly tried war crimes and ordinary crimes together.  Indeed, as Howland observes, &#x93;[n]ot infrequently the crime, as charged and found, was a combination of the two species of offenses.&#x94;  Howland 1071; see also Davis 310, n. 2; Winthrop 842.  The example he gives is &#x93; &#x91;murder in violation of the laws of war.&#x92; &#x94;  Howland 1071&#x96;1072.  Winthrop&#x92;s conspiracy &#x93;of the first and second classes combined&#x94; is, like Howland&#x92;s example, best understood as a species of compound offense of the type tried by the hybrid military commissions of the Civil War.  It is not a stand-alone offense against the law of war.  Winthrop confirms this understanding later in his discussion, when he emphasizes that &#x93;<em>overt acts</em>&#x94; constituting war crimes are the only proper subject at least of those military tribunals not convened to stand in for local courts.  Winthrop 841, and nn. 22, 23 (emphasis in original) (citing W. Finlason, Martial Law 130 (1867)).</p>

            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Thomas</span> cites as evidence that conspiracy is a recognized violation of the law of war the Civil War indictment against Henry Wirz, which charged the defendant  with &#x93; &#x91;[m]aliciously, willfully, and traitorously &#x2026; combining, confederating, and conspiring [with others] to injure the health and destroy the lives of soldiers in the military service of the United States &#x2026; to the end that the armies of the United States might be weakened and impaired, in violation of the laws and customs of war.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Post</em>, at 24&#x96;25 (dissenting opinion) (quoting H. R. Doc. No. 314, 55th Cong., 3d Sess., 785 (1865); emphasis deleted).  As shown by the specification supporting that charge, however, Wirz was alleged to have <em>personally committed</em> a number of atrocities against his victims, including torture, injection of prisoners with poison, and use of &#x93;ferocious and bloodthirsty dogs&#x94; to &#x93;seize, tear, mangle, and maim the bodies and limbs&#x94; of prisoners, many of whom died as a result.  <em>Id.</em>, at 789&#x96;790.  Crucially, Judge Advocate General Holt determined that one of Wirz&#x92;s alleged co-conspirators, R. B. Winder, should <em>not</em> be tried by military commission because there was as yet insufficient evidence of his own personal involvement in the atrocities: &#x93;[I]n the case of R. B. Winder, <em>while the evidence at the trial of Wirz was deemed by the court to implicate him in the conspiracy</em> against the lives of all Federal prisoners in rebel hands, <em>no such specific overt acts of violation of the laws of war</em> are as yet fixed upon him as to make it expedient to prefer formal charges and bring him to trial.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 783 (emphases added).<a name="ZO-37ref" href="#ZO-37" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, the sources that the Government and <span class="smallcaps">Justice Thomas</span> rely upon to show that conspiracy to violate the law of war is itself a violation of the law of war in fact demonstrate quite the opposite.  Far from making the requisite substantial showing, the Government has failed even to offer a &#x93;merely colorable&#x94; case for inclusion of conspiracy among those offenses cognizable by law-of-war military commission.  Cf. <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 36.  Because the charge does not support the commission&#x92;s jurisdiction, the commission lacks authority to try Hamdan.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The charge&#x92;s shortcomings are not merely formal, but are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition&#x97;at least in the absence of specific congressional authorization&#x97;for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.  Hamdan&#x92;s tribunal was appointed not by a military commander in the field of battle, but by a retired major general stationed away from any active hostilities.  Cf. <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush, </em>542 U. S., at 487 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy, J.</span>, concurring in judgment) (observing that &#x93;Guantanamo Bay is &#x2026; far removed from any hostilities&#x94;).  Hamdan is charged not with an overt act for which he was caught redhanded in a theater of war and which military efficiency demands be tried expeditiously, but with an <em>agreement</em> the inception of which long predated the attacks of September 11, 2001 and the AUMF.  That may well be a crime,<a name="ZO-41ref" href="#ZO-41" class="">

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/821.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;821</a>.  None of the overt acts alleged to have been committed in furtherance of the agreement is itself a war crime, or even necessarily occurred during time of, or in a theater of, war.  Any urgent need for imposition or execution of judgment is utterly belied by the record; Hamdan was arrested in November 2001 and he was not charged until mid-2004.  These simply are not the circumstances in which, by any stretch of the historical evidence or this Court&#x92;s precedents, a military commission established by Executive Order under the authority of Article 21 of the UCMJ may lawfully try a person and subject him to punishment.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">VI</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Whether or not the Government has charged Hamdan with an offense against the law of war cognizable by military commission, the commission lacks power to proceed.  The UCMJ conditions the President&#x92;s use of military commissions on compliance not only with the American common law of war, but also with the rest of the UCMJ itself, insofar as applicable, and with the &#x93;rules and precepts of the law of nations,&#x94; <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U.

The procedures that the Government has decreed will govern Hamdan&#x92;s trial by commission violate these laws.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The commission&#x92;s procedures are set forth in Commission Order No. 1, which was amended most recently on </p>

Every commission established pursuant to Commission Order No. 1 must have a presiding officer and at least three other members, all of whom must be commissioned officers.  &#xA7;4(A)(1).  The presiding officer&#x92;s job is to rule on questions of law and other evidentiary and interlocutory issues; the other members make findings and, if applicable, sentencing decisions.  &#xA7;4(A)(5).  The accused is entitled to appointed military counsel and may hire civilian counsel at his own expense so long as such counsel is a U.

See &#xA7;&#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P).  These rights are subject, however, to one glaring condition: The accused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from, and precluded from ever learning what evidence was presented during, any part of the proceeding that either the Appointing Authority or the presiding officer decides to &#x93;close.&#x94;  Grounds for such closure &#x93;include the protection of information classified or classifiable &#x2026; ; information protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure; the physical safety of participants in Commission proceedings, including prospective witnesses; intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or activities; and other national security interests.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(B)(3).<a name="ZO-42ref" href="#ZO-42" class="">

Under this test, not only is testimonial hearsay and evidence obtained through coercion fully admissible, but neither live testimony nor witnesses&#x92; written statements need be sworn.

Moreover, the accused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to evidence in the form of &#x93;protected information&#x94; (which includes classified information as well as &#x93;information protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure&#x94; and &#x93;information concerning other national security interests,&#x94; &#xA7;&#xA7;6(B)(3), 6(D)(5)(a)(v)), so long as the presiding officer concludes that the evidence is &#x93;probative&#x94; under &#xA7;6(D)(1) and that its admission without the accused&#x92;s knowledge would not &#x93;result in the denial of a full and fair trial.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(D)(5)(b).<a name="ZO-43ref" href="#ZO-43" class="">

Any appeal is taken to a three-member review panel composed of military officers and designated by the Secretary of Defense, only one member of which need have experience as a judge.  &#xA7;6(H)(4).

        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan raises both general and particular objections to the procedures set forth in Commission Order No. 1.  His general objection is that the procedures&#x92; admitted deviation from those governing courts-martial itself renders the commission illegal.  Chief among his particular objections are that he may, under the Commission Order, be convicted based on evidence he has not seen or heard, and that any evidence admitted against him need not comply with the admissibility or relevance rules typically applicable in criminal trials and court-martial proceedings.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government objects to our consideration of any procedural challenge at this stage on the grounds that (1) the abstention doctrine espoused in <em>Councilman</em>,

The first of these contentions was disposed of in Part III, <em>supra</em>, and neither of the latter two is sound.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, because Hamdan apparently is not subject to the death penalty (at least as matters now stand) and may receive a sentence shorter than 10 years&#x92; imprisonment, he has no automatic right to review of the commission&#x92;s &#x93;final decision&#x94;<a name="ZO-44ref" href="#ZO-44" class="">

2743.  Second, contrary to the Government&#x92;s assertion, there <em>is</em> a &#x93;basis to presume&#x94; that the procedures employed during Hamdan&#x92;s trial will violate the law: The procedures are described with particularity in Commission Order No. 1, and implementation of some of them has already occurred.  One of Hamdan&#x92;s complaints is that he will be, and <em>indeed already has been</em>, excluded from his own trial.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 12; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a.  Under these circumstances, review of the procedures in advance of a &#x93;final decision&#x94;&#x97;the timing of which is left entirely to the discretion of the President under the DTA&#x97;is appropriate.  We turn, then, to consider the merits of Hamdan&#x92;s procedural challenge.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In part because the difference between military commissions and courts-martial originally was a difference of jurisdiction alone, and in part to protect against abuse and ensure evenhandedness under the pressures of war, the procedures governing trials by military commission historically have been the same as those governing courts-martial.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 1 The War of the Rebellion 248 (2d series 1894) (General Order 1 issued during the Civil War required military commissions to &#x93;be constituted in a similar manner and their proceedings be conducted according to the same general rules as courts-martial in order to prevent abuses which might otherwise arise&#x94;).  Accounts of commentators from Winthrop through General Crowder&#x97;who drafted Article of War 15 and whose views have been deemed &#x93;authoritative&#x94; by this Court, <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 353&#x97;confirm as much.<a name="ZO-45ref" href="#ZO-45" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  As recently as the Korean and Vietnam wars, during which use of military commissions was contemplated but never made, the principle of procedural parity was espoused as a background assumption.  See Paust, Antiterrorism Military Commissions: Courting Illegality, 23 Mich. J. Int&#x92;l L. 1, 3&#x96;5 (2001&#x96;2002).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There is a glaring historical exception to this general rule.  The procedures and evidentiary rules used to try General Yamashita near the end of World War II deviated in significant respects from those then governing courts-martial.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/1" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 1</a>.  The force of that precedent, however, has been seriously undermined by post-World War II developments.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Yamashita, from late 1944 until September 1945, was Commanding General of the Fourteenth Army Group of the Imperial Japanese Army, which had exercised control over the Philippine Islands.  On September 3, 1945, after American forces regained control of the Philippines, Yamashita surrendered.  Three weeks later, he was charged with violations of the law of war.  A few weeks after that, he was arraigned before a military commission convened in the Philippines.  He pleaded not guilty, and his trial lasted for two months.  On December 7, 1945, Yamashita was convicted and sentenced to hang.  See <em>id.</em>, at 5; <em>id.</em>, at 31&#x96;34 (Murphy, J., dissenting).  This Court upheld the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The procedures and rules of evidence employed during Yamashita&#x92;s trial departed so far from those used in courts-martial that they generated an unusually long and vociferous critique from two Members of this Court.  See <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;81 (Rutledge, J., joined by Murphy, J., dissenting).<a name="ZO-46ref" href="#ZO-46" class="">

            </a>  Among the dissenters&#x92; primary concerns was that the commission had free rein to consider all evidence &#x93;which in the commission&#x92;s opinion &#x91;would be of assistance in proving or disproving the charge,&#x92; without any of the usual modes of authentication.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 49 (Rutledge, J.).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The majority, however, did not pass on the merits of Yamashita&#x92;s procedural challenges because it concluded that his status disentitled him to any protection under the Articles of War (specifically, those set forth in Article 38, which would become Article 36 of the UCMJ) or the Geneva Convention of 1929, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">47</a>Stat.
2021 (1929 Geneva Convention).  The Court explained that Yamashita was neither a &#x93;person made subject to the Articles of War by Article 2&#x94; thereof, 327 U. S., at 20, nor a protected prisoner of war being tried for crimes committed during his detention, <em>id.</em>, at 21.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At least partially in response to subsequent criticism of General Yamashita&#x92;s trial, the UCMJ&#x92;s codification of the Articles of War after World War II expanded the category of persons subject thereto to include defendants in Yamashita&#x92;s (and Hamdan&#x92;s) position,<a name="ZO-47ref" href="#ZO-47" class="">

            </a> and the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 extended prisoner-of-war protections to individuals tried for crimes committed before their capture.  See 3 Int&#x92;l Comm. of Red Cross,<a name="ZO-48ref" href="#ZO-48" class="">

            </a> Commentary: Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War 413 (1960) (hereinafter GCIII Commentary) (explaining that Article 85, which extends the Convention&#x92;s protections to &#x93;[p]risoners of war prosecuted under the laws of the Detaining Power for acts committed prior to capture,&#x94; was adopted in response to judicial interpretations of the 1929 Convention, including this Court&#x92;s decision in <em>Yamashita</em>).  The most notorious exception to the principle of uniformity, then, has been stripped of its precedential value.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The uniformity principle is not an inflexible one; it does not preclude all departures from the procedures dictated for use by courts-martial.  But any departure must be tailored to the exigency that necessitates it.  See Winthrop 835, n. 81.  That understanding is reflected in Article 36 of the UCMJ, which provides:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(a)The procedure, including modes of proof, in cases before courts-martial, courts of inquiry, military commissions, and other military tribunals may be prescribed by the President by regulations which shall, so far as he considers practicable, apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(b)All rules and regulations made under this article shall be uniform insofar as practicable and shall be reported to Congress.&#x94;  70A Stat. 50.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Article 36 places two restrictions on the President&#x92;s power to promulgate rules of procedure for courts-martial and military commissions alike.  First, no procedural rule he adopts may be &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; the UCMJ&#x97;however practical it may seem.  Second, the rules adopted must be &#x93;uniform insofar as practicable.&#x94;  That is, the rules applied to military commissions must be the same as those applied to courts-martial unless such uniformity proves impracticable.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan argues that Commission Order No. 1 violates both of these restrictions; he maintains that the procedures described in the Commission Order are inconsistent with the UCMJ and that the Government has offered no explanation for their deviation from the procedures governing courts-martial, which are set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2005 ed.) (Manual for Courts-Martial).  Among the inconsistencies Hamdan identifies is that between &#xA7;6 of the Commission Order, which permits exclusion of the accused from proceedings and denial of his access to evidence in certain circumstances, and the UCMJ&#x92;s requirement that &#x93;[a]ll &#x2026; proceedings&#x94; other than votes and deliberations by courts-martial &#x93;shall be made a part of the record and shall be in the presence of the accused.&#x94;  10  U. S. C. A. &#xA7;839(c) (Supp. 2006).  Hamdan also observes that the Commission Order dispenses with virtually all evidentiary rules applicable in courts-martial.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government has three responses.  First, it argues, only 9 of the UCMJ&#x92;s 158 Articles&#x97;the ones that expressly mention &#x93;military commissions&#x94;<a name="ZO-49ref" href="#ZO-49" class="">
                <sup>

            </a>&#x97;actually apply to commissions, and Commission Order No. 1 sets forth no procedure that is &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; those 9 provisions.  Second, the Government contends, military commissions would be of no use if the President were hamstrung by those provisions of the UCMJ that govern courts-martial.  Finally, the President&#x92;s determination that &#x93;the danger to the safety of the United States and the nature of international terrorism&#x94; renders it impracticable &#x93;to apply in military commissions &#x2026; the principles of law and rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts,&#x94; November 13 Order &#xA7;1(f), is, in the Government&#x92;s view, explanation enough for any deviation from court-martial procedures.  See Brief for Respondents 43&#x96;47, and n. 22.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan has the better of this argument.  Without reaching the question whether any provision of Commission Order No. 1 is strictly &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; other provisions of the UCMJ, we conclude that the &#x93;practicability&#x94; determination the President has made is insufficient to justify variances from the procedures governing courts-martial.  Subsection (b) of Article 36 was added after World War II, and requires a different showing of impracticability from the one required by subsection (a).  Subsection (a) requires that the rules the President promulgates for courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions alike conform to those that govern procedures in <em>Article III courts</em>, &#x93;so far as <em>he considers</em> practicable.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/836.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;836(a)</a> (emphasis added).  Subsection (b), by contrast, demands that the rules applied in courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions&#x97;whether or not they conform with the Federal Rules of Evidence&#x97;be &#x93;uniform <em>insofar as practicable</em>.&#x94;  &#xA7;836(b) (emphasis added).  Under the latter provision, then, the rules set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial must apply to military commissions unless impracticable.<a name="ZO-50ref" href="#ZO-50" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>50</b>

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The President here has determined, pursuant to subsection (a), that it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that govern &#x93;the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts,&#x94; &#xA7;836(a), to Hamdan&#x92;s commission.  We assume that complete deference is owed that determination.  The President has not, however, made a similar official determination that it is impracticable to apply the rules for courts-martial.<a name="ZO-51ref" href="#ZO-51" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>51</b>
                </sup>
            </a> And even if subsection (b)&#x92;s requirements may be satisfied without such an official determination, the requirements of that subsection are not satisfied here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the record before us demonstrates that it would be impracticable to apply court-martial rules in this case.  There is no suggestion, for example, of any logistical difficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in applying the usual principles of relevance and admissibility.  Assuming <em>arguendo</em> that the reasons articulated in the President&#x92;s Article 36(a) determination ought to be considered in evaluating the impracticability of applying court-martial rules, the only reason offered in support of that determination is the danger posed by international terrorism.<a name="ZO-52ref" href="#ZO-52" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>52</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  Without for one moment underestimating that danger, it is not evident to us why it should require, in the case of Hamdan&#x92;s trial, any variance from the rules that govern courts-martial.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The absence of any showing of impracticability is particularly disturbing when considered in light of the clear and admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamental protections afforded not just by the Manual for Courts-Martial but also by the UCMJ itself: the right to be present.  See 10  U. S. C. A. &#xA7;839(c) (Supp. 2006).  Whether or not that departure technically is &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; the terms of the UCMJ, 10  U. S. C. &#xA7;836(a), the jettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as &#x93;practicable.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Under the circumstances, then, the rules applicable in courts-martial must apply.  Since it is undisputed that Commission Order No. 1 deviates in many significant respects from those rules, it necessarily violates Article 36(b).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government&#x92;s objection that requiring compliance with the court-martial rules imposes an undue burden both ignores the plain meaning of Article 36(b) and misunderstands the purpose and the history of military commissions.  The military commission was not born of a desire to dispense a more summary form of justice than is afforded by courts-martial; it developed, rather, as a tribunal of necessity to be employed when courts-martial lacked jurisdiction over either the accused or the subject matter.  See Winthrop 831.  Exigency lent the commission its legitimacy, but did not further justify the wholesale jettisoning of procedural protections.  That history explains why the military commission&#x92;s procedures typically have been the ones used by courts-martial.  That the jurisdiction of the two tribunals today may sometimes overlap, see <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 354, does not detract from the force of this history;<a name="ZO-53ref" href="#ZO-53" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>53</b>
                </sup>
            </a> Article 21 did not transform the military commission from a tribunal of true exigency into a more convenient adjudicatory tool.  Article 36, confirming as much, strikes a careful balance between uniform procedure and the need to accommodate exigencies that may sometimes arise in a theater of war.  That Article not having been complied with here, the rules specified for Hamdan&#x92;s trial are illegal.<a name="ZO-54ref" href="#ZO-54" class="">

        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The procedures adopted to try Hamdan also violate the Geneva Conventions.  The Court of Appeals dismissed Hamdan&#x92;s Geneva Convention challenge on three independent grounds: (1) the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable; (2) Hamdan in any event is not entitled to their protections; and (3) even if he is entitled to their protections, <em>Councilman </em>abstention is appropriate.  Judge Williams, concurring, rejected the second ground but agreed with the majority respecting the first and the last.

, to hold that Hamdan could not invoke the Geneva Conventions to challenge the Government&#x92;s plan to prosecute him in accordance with Commission Order No. 1.  <em>Eisentrager</em> involved a challenge by 21 German nationals to their 1945 convictions for war crimes by a military tribunal convened in Nanking, China, and to their subsequent imprisonment in occupied Germany.  The petitioners argued, <em>inter alia</em>, that the 1929 Geneva Convention rendered illegal some of the procedures employed during their trials, which they said deviated impermissibly from the procedures used by courts-martial to try American soldiers.  See <em>id.</em>, at 789.  We rejected that claim on the merits because the petitioners (unlike Hamdan here) had failed to identify any prejudicial disparity &#x93;between the Commission that tried [them] and those that would try an offending soldier of the American forces of like rank,&#x94; and in any event could claim no protection, under the 1929 Convention, during trials for crimes that occurred before their confinement as prisoners of war.  <em>Id.</em>, at 790.<a name="ZO-56ref" href="#ZO-56" class="">

It is, however, the obvious scheme of the Agreement that responsibility for observance and enforcement of these rights is upon political and military authorities.

, they are, as the Government does not dispute, part of the law of war.  See <em>Hamdi, </em>542 U. S., at 520&#x96;521 (plurality opinion).  And compliance with the law of war is the condition upon which the authority set forth in Article 21 is granted.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">ii</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For the Court of Appeals, acknowledgment of that condition was no bar to Hamdan&#x92;s trial by commission.  As an alternative to its holding that Hamdan could not invoke the Geneva Conventions at all, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Conventions did not in any event apply to the armed conflict during which Hamdan was captured.  The court accepted the Executive&#x92;s assertions that Hamdan was captured in connection with the United States&#x92; war with al Qaeda and that that war is distinct from the war with the Taliban in Afghanistan.  It further reasoned that the war with al Qaeda evades the reach of the Geneva Conventions.  See 415 F. 3d, at 41&#x96;42. We, like Judge Williams, disagree with the latter conclusion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The conflict with al Qaeda is not, according to the Government, a conflict to which the full protections afforded detainees under the 1949 Geneva Conventions apply because Article 2 of those Conventions (which appears in all four Conventions) renders the full protections applicable only to &#x93;all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties.&#x94;  6 U.

One such provision prohibits &#x93;the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals thought, and the Government asserts, that Common Article 3 does not apply to Hamdan because the conflict with al Qaeda, being &#x93; &#x91;international in scope,&#x92; &#x94; does not qualify as a &#x93; &#x91;conflict not of an international character.&#x92; &#x94;  415 F. 3d, at 41.  That reasoning is erroneous.  The term &#x93;conflict not of an international character&#x94; is used here in contradistinction to a conflict between nations.  So much is demonstrated by the &#x93;fundamental logic [of] the Convention&#x92;s provisions on its application.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 44 (Williams, J., concurring).  Common Article 2 provides that &#x93;the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties.&#x94;  6 U. S. T., at 3318 (Art. 2, &#xB6;1).  High Contracting Parties (signatories) also must abide by all terms of the Conventions vis-&amp;Agrave;-vis one another even if one party to the conflict is a nonsignatory &#x93;Power,&#x94; and must so abide vis-&amp;Agrave;-vis the nonsignatory if &#x93;the latter accepts and applies&#x94; those terms.  <em>Ibid.</em> (Art. 2, &#xB6;3).  Common Article 3, by contrast, affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory &#x93;Power&#x94; who are involved in a conflict &#x93;in the territory of&#x94; a signatory.  The latter kind of conflict is distinguishable from the conflict described in Common Article 2 chiefly because it does not involve a clash between nations (whether signatories or not).  In context, then, the phrase &#x93;not of an international character&#x94; bears its literal meaning.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, J. Bentham, Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation 6, 296 (J. Burns &amp; H. Hart eds. 1970) (using the term &#x93;international law&#x94; as a &#x93;new though not inexpressive appellation&#x94; meaning &#x93;betwixt nation and nation&#x94;; defining &#x93;international&#x94; to include &#x93;mutual transactions between sovereigns as such&#x94;); Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, p. 1351 (1987) (&#x93;[A] non-international armed conflict is distinct from an international armed conflict because of the legal status of the entities opposing each other&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Although the official commentaries accompanying Common Article 3 indicate that an important purpose of the provision was to furnish minimal protection to rebels involved in one kind of &#x93;conflict not of an international character,&#x94; <em>i.e.</em>, a civil war, see GCIII Commentary 36&#x96;37, the commentaries also make clear &#x93;that the scope of the Article must be as wide as possible,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 36.<a name="ZO-63ref" href="#ZO-63" class="">

            </a>  In fact, limiting language that would have rendered Common Article 3 applicable &#x93;especially [to] cases of civil war, colonial conflicts, or wars of religion,&#x94; was omitted from the final version of the Article, which coupled broader scope of application with a narrower range of rights than did earlier proposed iterations.

Congress deemed that provision insufficient, standing alone, to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable to pending cases; hence its adoption of subsection (h)(2).

Senator Levin, one of the sponsors of the final bill, objected to earlier versions of the Act&#x92;s &#x93;effective date&#x94; provision that would have made subsection (e)(1) applicable to pending cases.  See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. S12667 (Nov. 10, 2005) (amendment proposed by Sen. Graham that would have rendered what is now subsection (e)(1) applicable to &#x93;any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act&#x94;).  Senator Levin urged adoption of an alternative amendment that &#x93;would apply only to new habeas cases filed after the date of enactment.&#x94;  Id., at S12802 (Nov. 15, 2005).  That alternative amendment became the text of subsection (h)(2).  (In light of the extensive discussion of the DTA&#x92;s effect on pending cases prior to passage of the Act, see, e.g., id., at S12664 (Nov. 10, 2005); id., at S12755 (Nov. 14, 2005); id., at S12799&#x96;S12802 (Nov. 15, 2005); id., at S14245, S14252&#x96;S14253, S14257&#x96;S14258, S14274&#x96;S14275 (Dec. 21, 2005), it cannot be said that the changes to subsection (h)(2) were inconsequential.  Cf. post, at 14 (Scalia, J., dissenting).)


While statements attributed to the final bill&#x92;s two other sponsors, Senators Graham and Kyl, arguably contradict Senator Levin&#x92;s contention that the final version of the Act preserved jurisdiction over pending habeas cases, see 151 Cong. Rec. S14263&#x96;S14264 (Dec. 21, 2005), those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record after the Senate debate.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 5, n. 6; see also 151 Cong. Rec. S14260 (statement of Sen. Kyl) (&#x93;I would like to say a few words about the now-completed National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006&#x94; (emphasis added)).  All statements made during the debate itself support Senator Levin&#x92;s understanding that the final text of the DTA would not render subsection (e)(1) applicable to pending cases.  See, e.g., id., at S14245, S14252&#x96;S14253, S14274&#x96;S14275 (Dec. 21, 2005).  The statements that Justice Scalia cites as evidence to the contrary construe subsection (e)(3) to strip this Court of jurisdiction, see post, at 12, n. 4 (dissenting opinion) (quoting 151 Cong. Rec. S12796 (Nov. 15, 2005) (statement of Sen. Specter))&#x97;a construction that the Government has expressly disavowed in this litigation, see n. 11, infra.

Rec. S12756 (Nov. 14, 2005)), follows directly after the uncontradicted statement of his co-sponsor, Senator Levin, assuring members of the Senate that &#x93;the amendment will not strip the courts of jurisdiction over [pending] cases.&#x94;  Id., at S12755.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-20" href="#ZO-20ref">20</a> Having correctly declined to abstain from addressing Hamdan&#x92;s challenge to the lawfulness of the military commission convened to try him, the Court of Appeals suggested that Councilman abstention nonetheless applied to bar its consideration of one of Hamdan&#x92;s arguments&#x97;namely, that his commission violated Article 3 of the Third Geneva Convention, 6 U. S. T. 3316, 3318.  See Part VI, infra.  Although the Court of Appeals rejected the Article 3 argument on the merits, it also stated that, because the challenge was not &#x93;jurisdictional,&#x94; it did not fall within the exception that Schlesinger v. Councilman, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a> (1975)
, recognized for defendants who raise substantial arguments that a military tribunal lacks personal jurisdiction over them.  See 415 F. 3d, at 42.


In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals conflated two distinct inquiries: (1) whether Hamdan has raised a substantial argument that the military commission lacks authority to try him; and, more fundamentally, (2) whether the comity considerations underlying Councilman apply to trigger the abstention principle in the first place.  As the Court of Appeals acknowledged at the beginning of its opinion, the first question warrants consideration only if the answer to the second is yes.  See 415 F. 3d, at 36&#x96;37.  Since, as the Court of Appeals properly concluded, the answer to the second question is in fact no, there is no need to consider any exception.


At any rate, it appears that the exception would apply here.  As discussed in Part VI, infra, Hamdan raises a substantial argument that, because the military commission that has been convened to try him is not a &#x93; &#x91;regularly constituted court&#x92; &#x94; under the Geneva Conventions, it is ultra vires and thus lacks jurisdiction over him.

&#x93;If, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, then, on the theatre of active military operations, where war really prevails, there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society; and as no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course.  As necessity creates the rule, so it limits its duration; for, if this government is continued after the courts are reinstated, it is a gross usurpation of power.  Martial rule can never exist where the courts are open, and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction.  It is also confined to the locality of actual war.&#x94;  4 Wall., at 127 (emphases in original).

See post, at 7&#x96;10 (dissenting opinion).  But even the Government does not go so far; although the United States had for some time prior to the attacks of September 11, 2001, been aggressively pursuing al Qaeda, neither in the charging document nor in submissions before this Court has the Government asserted that the President&#x92;s war powers were activated prior to September 11, 2001.  Cf. Brief for Respondents 25 (describing the events of September 11, 2001, as &#x93;an act of war&#x94; that &#x93;triggered a right to deploy military forces abroad to defend the United States by combating al Qaeda&#x94;).  Justice Thomas&#x92; further argument that the AUMF is &#x93;backward looking&#x94; and therefore authorizes trial by military commission of crimes that occurred prior to the inception of war is insupportable.  See post, at 8, n. 3.  If nothing else, Article 21 of the UCMJ requires that the President comply with the law of war in his use of military commissions.  As explained in the text, the law of war permits trial only of offenses &#x93;committed within the period of the war.&#x94;  Winthrop 837; see also Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28&#x96;29 (observing that law-of-war military commissions may be used to try &#x93;those enemies who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have violated the law of war&#x94; (emphasis added)).  The sources that Justice Thomas relies on to suggest otherwise simply do not support his position.  Colonel Green&#x92;s short exegesis on military commissions cites Howland for the proposition that &#x93;[o]ffenses committed before a formal declaration of war or before the declaration of martial law may be tried by military commission.&#x94;  The Military Commission, 42 Am. J. Int&#x92;l L. 832, 848 (1948) (emphases added) (cited post, at 9&#x96;10).  Assuming that to be true, nothing in our analysis turns on the admitted absence of either a formal declaration of war or a declaration of martial law.  Our focus instead is on the September 11, 2001 attacks that the Government characterizes as the relevant &#x93;act[s] of war,&#x94; and on the measure that authorized the President&#x92;s deployment of military force&#x97;the AUMF.   Because we do not question the Government&#x92;s position that the war commenced with the events of September 11, 2001, the Prize Cases, 
2Black
635 (1863) (cited post, at 2, 7, 8, and 10 (Thomas, J., dissenting)), are not germane to the analysis.


Finally, Justice Thomas&#x92; assertion that Julius Otto Kuehn&#x92;s trial by military commission &#x93;for conspiring with Japanese officials to betray the United States fleet to the Imperial Japanese Government prior to its attack on Pearl Harbor&#x94; stands as authoritative precedent for Hamdan&#x92;s trial by commission, post, at 9, misses the mark in three critical respects.  First, Kuehn was tried for the federal espionage crimes under what were then 50 U. S C. &#xA7;&#xA7;31, 32, and 34, not with common-law violations of the law of war.  See Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 30, pp. 3067&#x96;3069 (1946).  Second, he was tried by martial law commission (a kind of commission Justice Thomas acknowledges is not relevant to the analysis here, and whose jurisdiction extends to offenses committed within &#x93;the exercise of . . . martial law,&#x94; Winthrop 837, see supra, n. 28), not a commission established exclusively to try violations of the law of war.  See ibid.   Third, the martial law commissions established to try crimes in Hawaii were ultimately declared illegal by this Court.  See Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/304" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 304</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">324</a> (1946)
 (&#x93;The phrase &#x91;martial law&#x92; as employed in [the Hawaiian Organic Act], while intended to authorize the military to act vigorously for the maintenance of an orderly civil government and for the defense of the Islands against actual or threatened rebellion or invasion, was not intended to authorize the supplanting of courts by military tribunals&#x94;).
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-32" href="#ZO-32ref">32</a> Justice Thomas adopts the remarkable view, not advocated by the Government, that the charging document in this case actually includes more than one charge: Conspiracy and several other ill-defined crimes, like &#x93;joining an organization&#x94; that has a criminal purpose, &#x93; &#x91;[b]eing a guerilla,&#x92; &#x94; and aiding the enemy.  See post, at 16&#x96;21, and n. 9.  There are innumerable problems with this approach.


First, the crimes Justice Thomas identifies were not actually charged.  It is one thing to observe that charges before a military commission &#x93; &#x91;need not be stated with the precision of a common law indictment,&#x92; &#x94; post, at 15, n. 7 (citation omitted); it is quite another to say that a crime not charged may nonetheless be read into an indictment.   Second, the Government plainly had available to it the tools and the time it needed to charge petitioner with the various crimes Justice Thomas refers to, if it believed they were supported by the allegations.  As Justice Thomas himself observes, see post, at 21, the crime of aiding the enemy may, in circumstances where the accused owes allegiance to the party whose enemy he is alleged to have aided, be triable by military commission pursuant to Article 104 of the UCMJ, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/904.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;904</a>.  Indeed, the Government has charged detainees under this provision when it has seen fit to do so.  See Brief for David Hicks as Amicus Curiae 7.


Third, the cases Justice Thomas relies on to show that Hamdan may be guilty of violations of the law of war not actually charged do not support his argument.  Justice Thomas begins by blurring the distinction between those categories of &#x93;offender&#x94; who may be tried by military commission (e.g., jayhawkers and the like) with the &#x93;offenses&#x94; that may be so tried.  Even when it comes to &#x93; &#x91;being a guerilla,&#x92; &#x94; cf. post, at 18, n. 9 (citation omitted), a label alone does not render a person susceptible to execution or other criminal punishment; the charge of &#x93; &#x91;being a guerilla&#x92; &#x94; invariably is accompanied by the allegation that the defendant &#x93; &#x91;took up arms&#x92; &#x94; as such.  This is because, as explained by Judge Advocate General Holt in a decision upholding the charge of &#x93; &#x91;being a guerilla&#x92; &#x94; as one recognized by &#x93;the universal usage of the times,&#x94; the charge is simply shorthand (akin to &#x93;being a spy&#x94;) for &#x93;the perpetration of a succession of similar acts&#x94; of violence.  Record Books of the Judge Advocate General Office, R. 3, 590.   The sources cited by Justice Thomas confirm as much.  See cases cited post, at 18, n. 9.


Likewise, the suggestion that the Nuremberg precedents support Hamdan&#x92;s conviction for the (uncharged) crime of joining a criminal organization must fail.  Cf. post, at 19&#x96;21.  The convictions of certain high-level Nazi officials for &#x93;membership in a criminal organization&#x94; were secured pursuant to specific provisions of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal that permitted indictment of individual organization members following convictions of the organizations themselves.  See Arts. 9 and 10, in 1 Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal 12 (1947).   The initial plan to use organizations&#x92; convictions as predicates for mass individual trials ultimately was abandoned.  See T. Taylor, Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir 584&#x96;585, 638 (1992).

W. Rehnquist, All the Laws But One: Civil Liberties in Wartime 165&#x96;167 (1998) (analyzing the conspiracy charges in light of ordinary criminal law principles at the time), is at best an equivocal exception.  Although the charge against the defendants in that case accused them of &#x93;combining, confederating, and conspiring together&#x94; to murder the President, they were also charged (as we read the indictment, cf. post, at 23, n. 14 (Thomas, J., dissenting)) with &#x93;maliciously, unlawfully, and traitorously murdering the said Abraham Lincoln.&#x94;  H. R. Doc. No. 314, 55th Cong., 1st Sess., 696 (1899).

But even if Congress was concerned with ensuring uniformity across service branches, that does not mean it did not also intend to codify the longstanding practice of procedural parity between courts-martial and other military tribunals.  Indeed, the suggestion that Congress did not intend uniformity across tribunal types is belied by the textual proximity of subsection (a) (which requires that the rules governing criminal trials in federal district courts apply, absent the President&#x92;s determination of impracticability, to courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions alike) and subsection (b) (which imposes the uniformity requirement).

            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Stevens</span> announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I through IV, Parts VI through VI&#x96;D&#x96;iii, Part VI&#x96;D&#x96;v, and Part VII, and an opinion with respect to Parts V and VI&#x96;D&#x96;iv, in which <span class="smallcaps">Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, </span>and <span class="smallcaps">Justice Breyer</span> join.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni national, is in custody at an American prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  In November 2001, during hostilities between the United States and the Taliban (which then governed Afghanistan), Hamdan was captured by militia forces and turned over to the U. S. military.  In June 2002, he was transported to Guantanamo Bay.  Over a year later, the President deemed him eligible for trial by military commission for then-unspecified crimes.  After another year had passed, Hamdan was charged with one count of conspiracy &#x93;to commit &#x2026; offenses triable by military commission.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus and mandamus to challenge the Executive Branch&#x92;s intended means of prosecuting this charge.  He concedes that a court-martial constituted in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/801.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;801</a>
            <em>et seq.</em> (2000 ed. and Supp. III), would have authority to try him.  His objection is that the military commission the President has convened lacks such authority, for two principal reasons: First, neither congressional Act nor the common law of war supports trial by this commission for the crime of conspiracy&#x97;an offense that, Hamdan says, is not a violation of the law of war.  Second, Hamdan contends, the procedures that the President has adopted to try him violate the most basic tenets of military and international law, including the principle that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear the evidence against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The District Court granted Hamdan&#x92;s request for a writ of habeas corpus.  344 F. Supp. 2d 152 (DC 2004).  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  415 F. 3d 33 (2005).  Recognizing, as we did over a half-century ago, that trial by military commission is an extraordinary measure raising important questions about the balance of powers in our constitutional structure, <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>

, we granted certiorari.  546 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the military commission convened to try Hamdan lacks power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the Geneva Conventions.  Four of us also conclude, see Part V, <em>infra</em>, that the offense with which Hamdan has been charged is not an &#x93;offens[e] that by &#x2026; the law of war may be tried by military commissions.&#x94;  10  U.

        <p class="bodytext">    On September 11, 2001, agents of the al Qaeda terrorist organization hijacked commercial airplanes and attacked the World Trade Center in New York City and the national headquarters of the Department of Defense in Arlington, Virginia.  Americans will never forget the devastation wrought by these acts.  Nearly 3,000 civilians were killed.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Congress responded by adopting a Joint Resolution authorizing the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks &#x2026; in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF),

224, note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1541.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. &#xA7;1541</a> (2000 ed., Supp. III).  Acting pursuant to the AUMF, and having determined that the Taliban regime had supported al Qaeda, the President ordered the Armed Forces of the United States to invade Afghanistan.  In the ensuing hostilities, hundreds of individuals, Hamdan among them, were captured and eventually detained at Guantanamo Bay.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On November 13, 2001, while the United States was still engaged in active combat with the Taliban, the President issued a comprehensive military order intended to govern the &#x93;Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,&#x94; 66 Fed. Reg. 57833 (hereinafter November 13 Order or Order).  Those subject to the November 13 Order include any noncitizen for whom the President determines &#x93;there is reason to believe&#x94; that he or she (1) &#x93;is or was&#x94; a member of al Qaeda or (2) has engaged or participated in terrorist activities aimed at or harmful to the United States.  <em>Id.</em>, at 57834.  Any such individual &#x93;shall, when tried, be tried by military commission for any and all offenses triable by military commission that such individual is alleged to have committed, and may be punished in accordance with the penalties provided under applicable law, including imprisonment or death.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  The November 13 Order vested in the Secretary of Defense the power to appoint military commissions to try individuals subject to the Order, but that power has since been delegated to John D. Altenberg, Jr., a retired Army major general and longtime military lawyer who has been designated &#x93;Appointing Authority for Military Commissions.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On July 3, 2003, the President announced his determination that Hamdan and five other detainees at Guantanamo Bay were subject to the November 13 Order and thus triable by military commission.  In December 2003, military counsel was appointed to represent Hamdan.  Two months later, counsel filed demands for charges and for a speedy trial pursuant to Article 10 of the UCMJ, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/810.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;810</a>.  On February 23, 2004, the legal adviser to the Appointing Authority denied the applications, ruling that Hamdan was not entitled to any of the protections of the UCMJ.  Not until July 13, 2004, after Hamdan had commenced this action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, did the Government finally charge him with the offense for which, a year earlier, he had been deemed eligible for trial by military commission.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The charging document, which is unsigned, contains 13 numbered paragraphs.  The first two paragraphs recite the asserted bases for the military commission&#x92;s jurisdiction&#x97;namely, the November 13 Order and the President&#x92;s July 3, 2003, declaration that Hamdan is eligible for trial by military commission.  The next nine paragraphs, collectively entitled &#x93;General Allegations,&#x94; describe al Qaeda&#x92;s activities from its inception in 1989 through 2001 and identify Osama bin Laden as the group&#x92;s leader.  Hamdan is not mentioned in these paragraphs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Only the final two paragraphs, entitled &#x93;Charge: Conspiracy,&#x94; contain allegations against Hamdan.  Paragraph 12 charges that &#x93;from on or about February 1996 to on or about November 24, 2001,&#x94; Hamdan &#x93;willfully and knowingly joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose and conspired and agreed with [named members of al Qaeda] to commit the following offenses triable by military commission: attacking civilians; attacking civilian objects; murder by an unprivileged belligerent; and terrorism.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.  There is no allegation that Hamdan had any command responsibilities, played a leadership role, or participated in the planning of any activity.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Paragraph 13 lists four &#x93;overt acts&#x94; that Hamdan is alleged to have committed sometime between 1996 and November 2001 in furtherance of the &#x93;enterprise and conspiracy&#x94;: (1) he acted as Osama bin Laden&#x92;s &#x93;bodyguard and personal driver,&#x94; &#x93;believ[ing]&#x94; all the while that bin Laden &#x93;and his associates were involved in&#x94; terrorist acts prior to and including the attacks of September 11, 2001; (2) he arranged for transportation of, and actually transported, weapons used by al Qaeda members and by bin Laden&#x92;s bodyguards (Hamdan among them); (3) he &#x93;drove or accompanied [O]sama bin Laden to various al Qaida-sponsored training camps, press conferences, or lectures,&#x94; at which bin Laden encouraged attacks against Americans; and (4) he received weapons training at al Qaeda-sponsored camps.  <em>Id.</em>, at 65a&#x96;67a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After this formal charge was filed, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington transferred Hamdan&#x92;s habeas and mandamus petitions to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  Meanwhile, a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) convened pursuant to a military order issued on July 7, 2004, decided that Hamdan&#x92;s continued detention at Guantanamo Bay was warranted because he was an &#x93;enemy combatant.&#x94;<a name="ZO-1ref" href="#ZO-1" class="">

            </a>  Separately, proceedings before the military commission commenced.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On November 8, 2004, however, the District Court granted Hamdan&#x92;s petition for habeas corpus and stayed the commission&#x92;s proceedings.  It concluded that the President&#x92;s authority to establish military commissions extends only to &#x93;offenders or offenses triable by military [commission] under the law of war,&#x94; 344 F. Supp. 2d, at 158; that the law of war includes the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, T. I. A. S. No. 3364 (Third Geneva Convention); that Hamdan is entitled to the full protections of the Third Geneva Convention until adjudged, in compliance with that treaty, not to be a prisoner of war; and that, whether or not Hamdan is properly classified as a prisoner of war, the military commission convened to try him was established in violation of both the UCMJ and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva Convention because it had the power to convict based on evidence the accused would never see or hear.  344 F. Supp. 2d, at 158&#x96;172.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals declined the Government&#x92;s invitation to abstain from considering Hamdan&#x92;s challenge.  Cf. <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a> (1975)
.  On the merits, the panel rejected the District Court&#x92;s further conclusion that Hamdan was entitled to relief under the Third Geneva Convention.  All three judges agreed that the Geneva Conventions were not &#x93;judicially enforceable,&#x94; 415 F. 3d, at 38, and two thought that the Conventions did not in any event apply to Hamdan, <em>id.</em>, at 40&#x96;42; but see <em>id.</em>, at 44 (Williams, J., concurring).  In other portions of its opinion, the court concluded that our decision in <em>Quirin</em> foreclosed any separation-of-powers objection to the military commission&#x92;s jurisdiction, and held that Hamdan&#x92;s trial before the contemplated commission would violate neither the UCMJ nor U. S. Armed Forces regulations intended to implement the Geneva Conventions.  415 F. 3d, at 38, 42&#x96;43.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On November 7, 2005, we granted certiorari to decide whether the military commission convened to try Hamdan has authority to do so, and whether Hamdan may rely on the Geneva Conventions in these proceedings.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On February 13, 2006, the Government filed a motion to dismiss the writ of certiorari.  The ground cited for dismissal was the recently enacted Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), Pub. L. 109&#x96;148, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2739.  We postponed our ruling on that motion pending argument on the merits, 546 U. S. ___ (2006), and now deny it.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The DTA, which was signed into law on December 30, 2005, addresses a broad swath of subjects related to detainees.  It places restrictions on the treatment and interrogation of detainees in U. S. custody, and it furnishes procedural protections for U. S. personnel accused of engaging in improper interrogation.  DTA &#xA7;&#xA7;1002&#x96;1004, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2739&#x96;2740.  It also sets forth certain &#x93;<span class="smallcaps">procedures for status review of detainees outside the United States</span>.&#x94;  &#xA7;1005, <em>id.</em>, at 2740.  Subsections (a) through (d) of &#xA7;1005 direct the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the procedures being used by CSRTs to determine the proper classification of detainees held in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and to adopt certain safeguards as part of those procedures.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Subsection (e) of &#xA7;1005, which is entitled &#x93;<span class="smallcaps">Judicial Review of Detention of Enemy Combatants</span>,&#x94; supplies the basis for the Government&#x92;s jurisdictional argument.  The subsection contains three numbered paragraphs.  The first paragraph amends the judicial code as follows:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(1)<span class="smallcaps">In general</span>.&#x97;Section 2241 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93; &#x91;(e)Except as provided in section 1005 of the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005, no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider&#x97;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93; &#x91;(1)an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; or</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93; &#x91;(2)any other action against the United States or its agents relating to any aspect of the detention by the Department of Defense of an alien at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, who&#x97;</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Paragraph (2) of subsection (e) vests in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit the &#x93;exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of any final decision of a [CSRT] that an alien is properly designated as an enemy combatant.&#x94;  Paragraph (2) also delimits the scope of that review.  See &#xA7;&#xA7;1005(e)(2)(C)(i)&#x96;(ii), <em>id.</em>, at 2742.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Paragraph (3) mirrors paragraph (2) in structure, but governs judicial review of final decisions of military commissions, not CSRTs.  It vests in the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit &#x93;exclusive jurisdiction to determine the validity of any final decision rendered pursuant to Military Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).&#x94;  &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(A), <em>id.</em>, at 2743.<a name="ZO-2ref" href="#ZO-2" class="">

            </a>  Review is as of right for any alien sentenced to death or a term of imprisonment of 10 years or more, but is at the Court of Appeals&#x92; discretion in all other cases.  The scope of review is limited to the following inquiries:</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, &#xA7;1005 contains an &#x93;effective date&#x94; provision, which reads as follows:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(1)<span class="smallcaps">In general</span>.&#x97;This section shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this Act.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(2)<span class="smallcaps">Review of Combatant Status Tribunal and Military Commission Decisions</span>.&#x97;Paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (e) shall apply with respect to any claim whose review is governed by one of such paragraphs and that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.&#x94;  &#xA7;1005(h), <em>id.</em>, at 2743&#x96;2744.<a name="ZO-3ref" href="#ZO-3" class="">

        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The Act is silent about whether paragraph (1) of subsection (e) &#x93;shall apply&#x94; to claims pending on the date of enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government argues that &#xA7;&#xA7;1005(e)(1) and 1005(h) had the immediate effect, upon enactment, of repealing federal jurisdiction not just over detainee habeas actions yet to be filed but also over any such actions then pending in any federal court&#x97;including this Court.  Accordingly, it argues, we lack jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision below.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan objects to this theory on both constitutional and statutory grounds.  Principal among his constitutional arguments is that the Government&#x92;s preferred reading raises grave questions about Congress&#x92; authority to impinge upon this Court&#x92;s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases.  Support for this argument is drawn from <em>Ex parte Yerger,</em>8Wall.
85 (1869), in which, having explained that &#x93;the denial to this court of appellate jurisdiction&#x94; to consider an original writ of habeas corpus would &#x93;greatly weaken the efficacy of the writ,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 102&#x96;103, we held that Congress would not be presumed to have effected such denial absent an unmistakably clear statement to the contrary.  See <em>id.</em>, at 104&#x96;105; see also <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/518/651" class="subref" title="subref">518 U. S. 651</a> (1996)
;<em> Durousseau</em> v. <em>United States,</em> 6 Cranch 307, 314 (1810) (opinion for the Court by Marshall, C. J.) (The &#x93;appellate powers of this court&#x94; are not created by statute but are &#x93;given by the constitution&#x94;); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Klein,</em>13Wall.

                </sup>
            </a> could not have been &#x93;a plainer instance of positive exception&#x94;).  Hamdan also suggests that, if the Government&#x92;s reading is correct, Congress has unconstitutionally suspended the writ of habeas corpus.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We find it unnecessary to reach either of these arguments.  Ordinary principles of statutory construction suffice to rebut the Government&#x92;s theory&#x97;at least insofar as this case, which was pending at the time the DTA was enacted, is concerned.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government acknowledges that only paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (e) are expressly made applicable to pending cases, see &#xA7;1005(h)(2), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743&#x96;2744, but argues that the omission of paragraph (1) from the scope of that express statement is of no moment.  This is so, we are told, because Congress&#x92; failure to expressly reserve federal courts&#x92; jurisdiction over pending cases erects a presumption against jurisdiction, and that presumption is rebutted by neither the text nor the legislative history of the DTA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first part of this argument is not entirely without support in our precedents.  We have in the past &#x93;applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products,</em>

S., at 508.  If that is truly all the statute does, no retroactivity problem arises because the change in the law does not &#x93;impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party&#x92;s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U.

 (&#x93; &#x91;[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion&#x92; &#x94;).  The Court in <em>Lindh</em> relied on this reasoning to conclude that certain limitations on the availability of habeas relief imposed by AEDPA applied only to cases filed after that statute&#x92;s effective date.  Congress&#x92; failure to identify the temporal reach of those limitations, which governed noncapital cases, stood in contrast to its express command in the same legislation that new rules governing habeas petitions in capital cases &#x93;apply to cases pending on or after the date of enactment.&#x94;  &#xA7;107(c),

        <p class="bodytext">    A like inference follows <em>a fortiori </em>from <em>Lindh</em> in this case.  &#x93;If &#x2026; Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure that [&#xA7;&#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)] be applied to pending cases, it should have been just as concerned about [&#xA7;1005(e)(1)], unless it had the different intent that the latter [section] not be applied to the general run of pending cases.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  If anything, the evidence of deliberate omission is stronger here than it was in <em>Lindh</em>.  In <em>Lindh</em>, the provisions to be contrasted had been drafted separately but were later &#x93;joined together and &#x2026; considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 330.

 (&#x93;The more apparently deliberate the contrast, the stronger the inference, as applied, for example, to contrasting statutory sections originally enacted simultaneously in relevant respects&#x94;).  Here, Congress not only considered the respective temporal reaches of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (e) together at every stage, but omitted paragraph (1) from its directive that paragraphs (2) and (3) apply to pending cases only after having <em>rejected</em> earlier proposed versions of the statute that would have included what is now paragraph (1) within the scope of that directive.

        <p class="bodytext">    The Government nonetheless offers two reasons why, in its view, no negative inference may be drawn in favor of jurisdiction.  First, it asserts that <em>Lindh</em> is inapposite because &#x93;Section 1005(e)(1) and (h)(1) remove jurisdiction, while Section 1005(e)(2), (3) and (h)(2) create an exclusive review mechanism and define the nature of that review.&#x94;  Reply Brief in Support of Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss 4.

, the Government argues, Congress&#x92; different treatment of them is of no significance.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This argument must fail because it rests on a false distinction between the &#x93;jurisdictional&#x94; nature of subsection (e)(1) and the &#x93;procedural&#x94; character of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3).  In truth, all three provisions govern jurisdiction over detainees&#x92; claims; subsection (e)(1) addresses jurisdiction in habeas cases and other actions &#x93;relating to any aspect of the detention,&#x94; while subsections (e)(2) and (3) vest exclusive,<a name="ZO-11ref" href="#ZO-11" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    That subsection (e)(1) strips jurisdiction while subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) restore it in limited form is hardly a distinction upon which a negative inference must founder.  <span class="smallcaps">Justice Scalia</span>, in arguing to the contrary, maintains that Congress had &#x93;ample reason&#x94; to provide explicitly for application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) to pending cases because &#x93;jurisdiction-stripping&#x94; provisions like subsection (e)(1) have been treated differently under our retroactivity jurisprudence than &#x93;jurisdiction-conferring&#x94; ones like subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3).  <em>Post</em>, at 8 (dissenting opinion); see also Reply Brief in Support of Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss 5&#x96;6.

            </a>  Moreover, it strains credulity to suggest that the desire to reinforce the application of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) to pending cases drove Congress to <em>exclude</em> subsection (e)(1) from &#xA7;1005(h)(2).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government&#x92;s second objection is that applying subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) but not (e)(1) to pending cases &#x93;produces an absurd result&#x94; because it grants (albeit only temporarily) dual jurisdiction over detainees&#x92; cases in circumstances where the statute plainly envisions that the District of Columbia Circuit will have &#x93;<em>exclusive</em>&#x94; and immediate jurisdiction over such cases.  Reply Brief in Support of Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss 7.  But the premise here is faulty; subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) grant jurisdiction only over actions to &#x93;determine the validity of any final decision&#x94; of a CSRT or commission.  Because Hamdan, at least, is not contesting any &#x93;final decision&#x94; of a CSRT or military commission, his action does not fall within the scope of subsection (e)(2) or (e)(3).  There is, then, no absurdity.<a name="ZO-14ref" href="#ZO-14" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The Government&#x92;s more general suggestion that Congress can have had no good reason for preserving habeas jurisdiction over cases that had been brought by detainees prior to enactment of the DTA not only is belied by the legislative history, see n. 10, <em>supra</em>, but is otherwise without merit.  There is nothing absurd about a scheme under which pending habeas actions&#x97;particularly those, like this one, that challenge the very legitimacy of the tribunals whose judgments Congress would like to have reviewed&#x97;are preserved, and more routine challenges to final decisions rendered by those tribunals are carefully channeled to a particular court and through a particular lens of review.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, we cannot leave unaddressed <span class="smallcaps">Justice Scalia</span>&#x92;s contentions that the &#x93;meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear,&#x94; <em>post</em>, at 6, and that &#x93;the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed,&#x94; <em>post</em>, at 3 (emphasis in original).  Only by treating the <em>Bruner</em> rule as an inflexible trump (a thing it has never been, see n. 7, <em>supra</em>) and ignoring both the rest of &#xA7;1005&#x92;s text and its drafting history can one conclude as much.  Congress here expressly provided that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applied to pending cases.  It chose not to so provide&#x97;after having been presented with the option&#x97;for subsection (e)(1).  The omission is an integral part of the statutory scheme that muddies whatever &#x93;plain meaning&#x94; may be discerned from blinkered study of subsection (e)(1) alone.  The dissent&#x92;s speculation about what Congress might have intended by the omission not only is counterfactual, cf. n. 10, <em>supra</em> (recounting legislative history), but rests on both a misconstruction of the DTA and an erroneous view our precedents, see <em>supra</em>, at 17, and n. 12.</p>

Objecting that the alleged offenses were not &#x93; &#x91;service connected,&#x92; &#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 740, the officer filed suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the proceedings.  He neither questioned the lawfulness of courts-martial or their procedures nor disputed that, as a serviceman, he was subject to court-martial jurisdiction.

First, military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts.  See <em>Councilman</em>, 420 U. S., at 752.  Second, federal courts should respect the balance that Congress struck between military preparedness and fairness to individual service members when it created &#x93;an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals, consisting of civilian judges &#x91;completely removed from all military influence or persuasion &#x2026; .&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 758 (quoting H.

First, Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.  Second, the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.  Unlike the officer in <em>Councilman</em>,<em/>Hamdan has no right to appeal any conviction to the civilian judges of the Court of Military Appeals (now called the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, see Pub.

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, neither of the two comity considerations underlying our decision to abstain in <em>Councilman</em> applies to the circumstances of this case.  Instead, this Court&#x92;s decision in <em>Quirin</em> is the most relevant precedent.  In <em>Quirin</em>, seven German saboteurs were captured upon arrival by submarine in New York and Florida.  317 U. S., at 21.  The President convened a military commission to try the saboteurs, who then filed habeas corpus petitions in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging their trial by commission.  We granted the saboteurs&#x92; petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals before judgment.  See <em>id.</em>, at 19.  Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.  That course of action was warranted, we explained, &#x93;[i]n view of the public importance of the questions raised by [the cases] and of the duty which rests on the courts, in time of war as well as in time of peace, to preserve unimpaired the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty, and because in our opinion the public interest required that we consider and decide those questions without any avoidable delay.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As the Court of Appeals here recognized, <em>Quirin </em>&#x93;provides a compelling historical precedent for the power of civilian courts to entertain challenges that seek to interrupt the processes of military commissions.&#x94;  415 F. 3d, at 36.<a name="ZO-20ref" href="#ZO-20" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the Government has identified no other &#x93;important countervailing interest&#x94; that would permit federal courts to depart from their general &#x93;duty to exercise the jurisdiction that is conferred upon them by Congress.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 716 (majority opinion).  To the contrary, Hamdan and the Government both have a compelling interest in knowing in advance whether Hamdan may be tried by a military commission that arguably is without any basis in law and operates free from many of the procedural rules prescribed by Congress for courts-martial&#x97;rules intended to safeguard the accused and ensure the reliability of any conviction.  While we certainly do not foreclose the possibility that abstention may be appropriate in some cases seeking review of ongoing military commission proceedings (such as military commissions convened on the battlefield), the foregoing discussion makes clear that, under our precedent, abstention is not justified here.  We therefore proceed to consider the merits of Hamdan&#x92;s challenge.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    The military commission, a tribunal neither mentioned in the Constitution nor created by statute, was born of military necessity.  See W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 831 (rev. 2d ed. 1920) (hereinafter Winthrop).  Though foreshadowed in some respects by earlier tribunals like the Board of General Officers that General Washington convened to try British Major John Andr&#xE9; for spying during the Revolutionary War, the commission &#x93;as such&#x94; was inaugurated in 1847.  <em>Id.</em>, at 832; G. Davis, A Treatise on the Military Law of the United States 308 (2d ed. 1909) (hereinafter Davis).  As commander of occupied Mexican territory, and having available to him no other tribunal, General Winfield Scott that year ordered the establishment of both &#x93; &#x91;<em>military commissions</em>&#x92; &#x94; to try ordinary crimes committed in the occupied territory and a &#x93;<em>council of war</em>&#x94; to try offenses against the law of war.  Winthrop 832 (emphases in original).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When the exigencies of war next gave rise to a need for use of military commissions, during the Civil War, the dual system favored by General Scott was not adopted.  Instead, a single tribunal often took jurisdiction over ordinary crimes, war crimes, and breaches of military orders alike.  As further discussed below, each aspect of that seemingly broad jurisdiction was in fact supported by a separate military exigency.  Generally, though, the need for military commissions during this period&#x97;as during the Mexican War&#x97;was driven largely by the then very limited jurisdiction of courts-martial: &#x93;The <em>occasion</em> for the military commission arises principally from the fact that the jurisdiction of the court-martial proper, in our law, is restricted by statute almost exclusively to members of the military force and to certain specific offences defined in a written code.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 831 (emphasis in original).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Exigency alone, of course, will not justify the establishment and use of penal tribunals not contemplated by Article I, &#xA7;8 and Article III, &#xA7;1 of the Constitution unless some other part of that document authorizes a response to the felt need.

Contrary to the Government&#x92;s assertion, however, even <em>Quirin</em> did not view the authorization as a sweeping mandate for the President to &#x93;invoke military commissions when he deems them necessary.&#x94;  Brief for Respondents 17.  Rather, the <em>Quirin</em> Court recognized that Congress had simply preserved what power, under the Constitution and the common law of war, the President had had before 1916 to convene military commissions&#x97;with the express condition that the President and those under his command comply with the law of war.

        <p class="bodytext">The Government would have us dispense with the inquiry that the Quirin Court undertook and find in either the AUMF or the DTA specific, overriding authorization for the very commission that has been convened to try Hamdan.  Neither of these congressional Acts, however, expands the President&#x92;s authority to convene military commissions.  First, while we assume that the AUMF activated the President&#x92;s war powers, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>,<em/>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/507" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 507</a> (2004)

        <p class="bodytext">    Likewise, the DTA cannot be read to authorize this commission.  Although the DTA, unlike either Article 21 or the AUMF, was enacted after the President had convened Hamdan&#x92;s commission, it contains no language authorizing that tribunal or any other at Guantanamo Bay.  The DTA obviously &#x93;recognize[s]&#x94; the existence of the Guantanamo Bay commissions in the weakest sense, Brief for Respondents 15, because it references some of the military orders governing them and creates limited judicial review of their &#x93;final decision[s],&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3),

But the statute also pointedly reserves judgment on whether &#x93;the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable&#x94; in reviewing such decisions and whether, if they are, the &#x93;standards and procedures&#x94; used to try Hamdan and other detainees actually violate the &#x93;Constitution and laws.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Together, the UCMJ, the AUMF, and the DTA at most acknowledge a general Presidential authority to convene military commissions in circumstances where justified under the &#x93;Constitution and laws,&#x94; including the law of war.  Absent a more specific congressional authorization, the task of this Court is, as it was in Quirin, to decide whether Hamdan&#x92;s military commission is so justified.

            <em>Quirin</em> is the model the Government invokes most frequently to defend the commission convened to try Hamdan.  That is both appropriate and unsurprising.  Since Guantanamo Bay is neither enemy-occupied territory nor under martial law, the law-of-war commission is the only model available.  At the same time, no more robust model of executive power exists; <em>Quirin</em> represents the high-water mark of military power to try enemy combatants for war crimes.</p>

First, &#x93;[a] military commission, (except where otherwise authorized by statute), can legally assume jurisdiction only of offenses committed within the field of the command of the convening commander.&#x94;  Winthrop 836.  The &#x93;field of command&#x94; in these circumstances means the &#x93;theatre of war.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Second, the offense charged &#x93;must have been committed within the period of the war.&#x94;<a name="ZO-28ref" href="#ZO-28" class="">

Finally, a law-of-war commission has jurisdiction to try only two kinds of offense: &#x93;Violations of the laws and usages of war cognizable by military tribunals only,&#x94; and &#x93;[b]reaches of military orders or regulations for which offenders are not legally triable by court-martial under the Articles of war.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 839.<a name="ZO-29ref" href="#ZO-29" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    All parties agree that Colonel Winthrop&#x92;s treatise accurately describes the common law governing military commissions, and that the jurisdictional limitations he identifies were incorporated in Article of War 15 and, later, Article 21 of the UCMJ.  It also is undisputed that Hamdan&#x92;s commission lacks jurisdiction to try him unless the charge &#x93;properly set[s] forth, not only the details of the act charged, but the circumstances conferring <em>jurisdiction</em>.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 842 (emphasis in original).

        <p class="bodytext">    These facts alone cast doubt on the legality of the charge and, hence, the commission; as Winthrop makes plain, the offense alleged must have been committed both in a theater of war and <em>during</em>, not before, the relevant conflict.  But the deficiencies in the time and place allegations also underscore&#x97;indeed are symptomatic of&#x97;the most serious defect of this charge: The offense it alleges is not triable by law-of-war military commission.  See <em>Yamashita</em>, 327 U.

            </a>  Winthrop explains that under the common law governing military commissions, it is not enough to intend to violate the law of war and commit overt acts in furtherance of that intention unless the overt acts either are themselves offenses against the law of war or constitute steps sufficiently substantial to qualify as an attempt.  See Winthrop 841 (&#x93;[T]he jurisdiction of the military commission should be restricted to cases of offence consisting in <em>overt acts</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, in unlawful commissions or actual attempts to commit, and not in intentions merely&#x94; (emphasis in original)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government cites three sources that it says show otherwise.  First, it points out that the Nazi saboteurs in <em>Quirin</em> were charged with conspiracy.  See Brief for Respondents 27.  Second, it observes that Winthrop at one point in his treatise identifies conspiracy as an offense &#x93;prosecuted by military commissions.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing Winthrop 839, and n. 5).  Finally, it notes that another military historian, Charles Roscoe Howland, lists conspiracy &#x93; &#x91;to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the enemy&#x92; &#x94; as an offense that was tried as a violation of the law of war during the Civil War.  Brief for Respondents 27&#x96;28 (citing C. Howland, Digest of Opinions of the Judge Advocates General of the Army 1071 (1912) (hereinafter Howland)).  On close analysis, however, these sources at best lend little support to the Government&#x92;s position and at worst undermine it.  By any measure, they fail to satisfy the high standard of clarity required to justify the use of a military commission.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    That the defendants in <em>Quirin</em> were charged with conspiracy is not persuasive, since the Court declined to address whether the offense actually qualified as a violation of the law of war&#x97;let alone one triable by military commission.  The <em>Quirin</em> defendants were charged with the following offenses:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;[I.]Violation of the law of war.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

&#x93;[II.]Violation of Article 81 of the Articles of War, defining the offense of relieving or attempting to relieve, or corresponding with or giving intelligence to, the enemy.</p>

The Government, defending its charge, argued that the conspiracy alleged &#x93;constitute[d] an additional violation of the law of war.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  The saboteurs disagreed; they maintained that &#x93;[t]he charge of conspiracy can not stand if the other charges fall.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 8.  The Court, however, declined to resolve the dispute.  It concluded, first, that the specification supporting Charge I adequately alleged a &#x93;violation of the law of war&#x94; that was not &#x93;merely colorable or without foundation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 36.  The facts the Court deemed sufficient for this purpose were that the defendants, admitted enemy combatants, entered upon U. S. territory in time of war without uniform &#x93;for the purpose of destroying property used or useful in prosecuting the war.&#x94;  That act was &#x93;a hostile and warlike&#x94; one.  <em>Id.</em>, at 36, 37.  The Court was careful in its decision to identify an overt, &#x93;complete&#x94; act.  Responding to the argument that the saboteurs had &#x93;not actually committed or attempted to commit any act of depredation or entered the theatre or zone of active military operations&#x94; and therefore had not violated the law of war, the Court responded that they had actually &#x93;passed our military and naval lines and defenses or went behind those lines, in civilian dress and with hostile purpose.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 38.  &#x93;The offense was complete when with that purpose they entered&#x97;or, having so entered, they remained upon&#x97;our territory in time of war without uniform or other appropriate means of identification.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Turning to the other charges alleged, the Court explained that &#x93;[s]ince the first specification of Charge I sets forth a violation of the law of war, we have no occasion to pass on the adequacy of the second specification of Charge I, or to construe the 81st and 82nd Articles of War for the purpose of ascertaining whether the specifications under Charges II and III allege violations of those Articles or whether if so construed they are constitutional.&#x94;  Id., at 46.  No mention was made at all of Charge IV&#x97;the conspiracy charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If anything, <em>Quirin</em> supports Hamdan&#x92;s argument that conspiracy is not a violation of the law of war.  Not only did the Court pointedly omit any discussion of the conspiracy charge, but its analysis of Charge I placed special emphasis on the <em>completion</em> of an offense; it took seriously the saboteurs&#x92; argument that there can be no violation of a law of war&#x97;at least not one triable by military commission&#x97;without the actual commission of or attempt to commit a &#x93;hostile and warlike act.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 37&#x96;38.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    That limitation makes eminent sense when one considers the necessity from whence this kind of military commission grew: The need to dispense swift justice, often in the form of execution, to illegal belligerents captured on the battlefield.  See S. Rep. No. 130, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 40 (1916) (testimony of Brig. Gen. Enoch H. Crowder) (observing that Article of War 15 preserves the power of &#x93;the military commander <em>in the field in time of war</em>&#x94; to use military commissions (emphasis added)).  The same urgency would not have been felt vis-&amp;Agrave;-vis enemies who had done little more than agree to violate the laws of war.  Cf. 
31Op. Atty. Gen.
356,
357,
361 (1918) (opining that a German spy could not be tried by military commission because, having been apprehended before entering &#x93;any camp, fortification or other military premises of the United States,&#x94; he had &#x93;committed [his offenses] outside of the field of military operations&#x94;).  The <em>Quirin</em> Court acknowledged as much when it described the President&#x92;s authority to use law-of-war military commissions as the power to &#x93;seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies <em>who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort</em> have violated the law of war.&#x94;  317 U. S., at 28&#x96;29 (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Winthrop and Howland are only superficially more helpful to the Government.  Howland, granted, lists &#x93;conspiracy by two or more to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the enemy&#x94; as one of over 20 &#x93;offenses against the laws and usages of war&#x94; &#x93;passed upon and punished by military commissions.&#x94;  Howland 1071.  But while the records of cases that Howland cites following his list of offenses against the law of war support inclusion of the other offenses mentioned, they provide no support for the inclusion of conspiracy as a violation of the law of war.  See <em>ibid.</em> (citing Record Books of the Judge Advocate General Office, R. 2, 144; R. 3, 401, 589, 649; R. 4, 320; R. 5, 36, 590; R. 6, 20; R. 7, 413; R. 8, 529; R. 9, 149, 202, 225, 481, 524, 535; R. 10, 567; R. 11, 473, 513; R. 13, 125, 675; R. 16, 446; R. 21, 101, 280).  Winthrop, apparently recognizing as much, excludes conspiracy of any kind from his own list of offenses against the law of war.  See Winthrop 839&#x96;840.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Winthrop does, unsurprisingly, include &#x93;criminal conspiracies&#x94; in his list of &#x93;[c]rimes and statutory offenses cognizable by State or U. S. courts&#x94; and triable by martial law or military government commission.  See <em>id.</em>, at 839.  And, in a footnote, he cites several Civil War examples of &#x93;conspiracies of this class, <em>or of the first and second classes combined</em>.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 839, n. 5 (emphasis added).  The Government relies on this footnote for its contention that conspiracy was triable both as an ordinary crime (a crime of the &#x93;first class&#x94;) and, independently, as a war crime (a crime of the &#x93;second class&#x94;).  But the footnote will not support the weight the Government places on it.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As we have seen, the military commissions convened during the Civil War functioned at once as martial law or military government tribunals and as law-of-war commissions.  See n. 27, <em>supra</em>.  Accordingly, they regularly tried war crimes and ordinary crimes together.  Indeed, as Howland observes, &#x93;[n]ot infrequently the crime, as charged and found, was a combination of the two species of offenses.&#x94;  Howland 1071; see also Davis 310, n. 2; Winthrop 842.  The example he gives is &#x93; &#x91;murder in violation of the laws of war.&#x92; &#x94;  Howland 1071&#x96;1072.  Winthrop&#x92;s conspiracy &#x93;of the first and second classes combined&#x94; is, like Howland&#x92;s example, best understood as a species of compound offense of the type tried by the hybrid military commissions of the Civil War.  It is not a stand-alone offense against the law of war.  Winthrop confirms this understanding later in his discussion, when he emphasizes that &#x93;<em>overt acts</em>&#x94; constituting war crimes are the only proper subject at least of those military tribunals not convened to stand in for local courts.  Winthrop 841, and nn. 22, 23 (emphasis in original) (citing W. Finlason, Martial Law 130 (1867)).</p>

            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Thomas</span> cites as evidence that conspiracy is a recognized violation of the law of war the Civil War indictment against Henry Wirz, which charged the defendant  with &#x93; &#x91;[m]aliciously, willfully, and traitorously &#x2026; combining, confederating, and conspiring [with others] to injure the health and destroy the lives of soldiers in the military service of the United States &#x2026; to the end that the armies of the United States might be weakened and impaired, in violation of the laws and customs of war.&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Post</em>, at 24&#x96;25 (dissenting opinion) (quoting H.

As shown by the specification supporting that charge, however, Wirz was alleged to have <em>personally committed</em> a number of atrocities against his victims, including torture, injection of prisoners with poison, and use of &#x93;ferocious and bloodthirsty dogs&#x94; to &#x93;seize, tear, mangle, and maim the bodies and limbs&#x94; of prisoners, many of whom died as a result.  <em>Id.</em>, at 789&#x96;790.  Crucially, Judge Advocate General Holt determined that one of Wirz&#x92;s alleged co-conspirators, R. B. Winder, should <em>not</em> be tried by military commission because there was as yet insufficient evidence of his own personal involvement in the atrocities: &#x93;[I]n the case of R. B. Winder, <em>while the evidence at the trial of Wirz was deemed by the court to implicate him in the conspiracy</em> against the lives of all Federal prisoners in rebel hands, <em>no such specific overt acts of violation of the laws of war</em> are as yet fixed upon him as to make it expedient to prefer formal charges and bring him to trial.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 783 (emphases added).<a name="ZO-37ref" href="#ZO-37" class="">

As one prominent figure from the Nuremberg trials has explained, members of the Tribunal objected to recognition of conspiracy as a violation of the law of war on the ground that &#x93;[t]he Anglo-American concept of conspiracy was not part of European legal systems and arguably not an element of the internationally recognized laws of war.&#x94;  T.

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, the sources that the Government and <span class="smallcaps">Justice Thomas</span> rely upon to show that conspiracy to violate the law of war is itself a violation of the law of war in fact demonstrate quite the opposite.  Far from making the requisite substantial showing, the Government has failed even to offer a &#x93;merely colorable&#x94; case for inclusion of conspiracy among those offenses cognizable by law-of-war military commission.  Cf. <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 36.  Because the charge does not support the commission&#x92;s jurisdiction, the commission lacks authority to try Hamdan.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The charge&#x92;s shortcomings are not merely formal, but are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition&#x97;at least in the absence of specific congressional authorization&#x97;for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.  Hamdan&#x92;s tribunal was appointed not by a military commander in the field of battle, but by a retired major general stationed away from any active hostilities.  Cf. <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush, </em>542 U. S., at 487 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy, J.</span>, concurring in judgment) (observing that &#x93;Guantanamo Bay is &#x2026; far removed from any hostilities&#x94;).  Hamdan is charged not with an overt act for which he was caught redhanded in a theater of war and which military efficiency demands be tried expeditiously, but with an <em>agreement</em> the inception of which long predated the attacks of September 11, 2001 and the AUMF.  That may well be a crime,<a name="ZO-41ref" href="#ZO-41" class="">

            </a> but it is not an offense that &#x93;by the law of war may be tried by military commissio[n].&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/821.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;821</a>.  None of the overt acts alleged to have been committed in furtherance of the agreement is itself a war crime, or even necessarily occurred during time of, or in a theater of, war.  Any urgent need for imposition or execution of judgment is utterly belied by the record; Hamdan was arrested in November 2001 and he was not charged until mid-2004.  These simply are not the circumstances in which, by any stretch of the historical evidence or this Court&#x92;s precedents, a military commission established by Executive Order under the authority of Article 21 of the UCMJ may lawfully try a person and subject him to punishment.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">VI</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Whether or not the Government has charged Hamdan with an offense against the law of war cognizable by military commission, the commission lacks power to proceed.  The UCMJ conditions the President&#x92;s use of military commissions on compliance not only with the American common law of war, but also with the rest of the UCMJ itself, insofar as applicable, and with the &#x93;rules and precepts of the law of nations,&#x94; <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 28&#x97;including, <em>inter alia</em>, the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.  See <em>Yamashita</em>, 327 U. S., at 20&#x96;21, 23&#x96;24.  The procedures that the Government has decreed will govern Hamdan&#x92;s trial by commission violate these laws.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The commission&#x92;s procedures are set forth in Commission Order No. 1, which was amended most recently on </p>
        <p class="bodytext">August 31, 2005&#x97;after Hamdan&#x92;s trial had already begun.  Every commission established pursuant to Commission Order No. 1 must have a presiding officer and at least three other members, all of whom must be commissioned officers.  &#xA7;4(A)(1).  The presiding officer&#x92;s job is to rule on questions of law and other evidentiary and interlocutory issues; the other members make findings and, if applicable, sentencing decisions.  &#xA7;4(A)(5).  The accused is entitled to appointed military counsel and may hire civilian counsel at his own expense so long as such counsel is a U. S. citizen with security clearance &#x93;at the level SECRET or higher.&#x94;  &#xA7;&#xA7;4(C)(2)&#x96;(3).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The accused also is entitled to a copy of the charge(s) against him, both in English and his own language (if different), to a presumption of innocence, and to certain other rights typically afforded criminal defendants in civilian courts and courts-martial.  See &#xA7;&#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P).  These rights are subject, however, to one glaring condition: The accused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from, and precluded from ever learning what evidence was presented during, any part of the proceeding that either the Appointing Authority or the presiding officer decides to &#x93;close.&#x94;  Grounds for such closure &#x93;include the protection of information classified or classifiable &#x2026; ; information protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure; the physical safety of participants in Commission proceedings, including prospective witnesses; intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or activities; and other national security interests.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(B)(3).<a name="ZO-42ref" href="#ZO-42" class="">

            </a>  Appointed military defense counsel must be privy to these closed sessions, but may, at the presiding officer&#x92;s discretion, be forbidden to reveal to his or her client what took place therein.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Another striking feature of the rules governing Hamdan&#x92;s commission is that they permit the admission of any evidence that, in the opinion of the presiding officer, &#x93;would have probative value to a reasonable person.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(D)(1).  Under this test, not only is testimonial hearsay and evidence obtained through coercion fully admissible, but neither live testimony nor witnesses&#x92; written statements need be sworn.  See &#xA7;&#xA7;6(D)(2)(b), (3).  Moreover, the accused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to evidence in the form of &#x93;protected information&#x94; (which includes classified information as well as &#x93;information protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure&#x94; and &#x93;information concerning other national security interests,&#x94; &#xA7;&#xA7;6(B)(3), 6(D)(5)(a)(v)), so long as the presiding officer concludes that the evidence is &#x93;probative&#x94; under &#xA7;6(D)(1) and that its admission without the accused&#x92;s knowledge would not &#x93;result in the denial of a full and fair trial.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(D)(5)(b).<a name="ZO-43ref" href="#ZO-43" class="">

                    <b>43</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  Finally, a presiding officer&#x92;s determination that evidence &#x93;would not have probative value to a reasonable person&#x94; may be overridden by a majority of the other commission members.  &#xA7;6(D)(1).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Once all the evidence is in, the commission members (not including the presiding officer) must vote on the accused&#x92;s guilt.  A two-thirds vote will suffice for both a verdict of guilty and for imposition of any sentence not including death (the imposition of which requires a unanimous vote).  &#xA7;6(F).  Any appeal is taken to a three-member review panel composed of military officers and designated by the Secretary of Defense, only one member of which need have experience as a judge.  &#xA7;6(H)(4).  The review panel is directed to &#x93;disregard any variance from procedures specified in this Order or elsewhere that would not materially have affected the outcome of the trial before the Commission.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Once the panel makes its recommendation to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary can either remand for further proceedings or forward the record to the President with his recommendation as to final disposition.  &#xA7;6(H)(5).  The President then, unless he has delegated the task to the Secretary, makes the &#x93;final decision.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(H)(6).  He may change the commission&#x92;s findings or sentence only in a manner favorable to the accused.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan raises both general and particular objections to the procedures set forth in Commission Order No. 1.  His general objection is that the procedures&#x92; admitted deviation from those governing courts-martial itself renders the commission illegal.  Chief among his particular objections are that he may, under the Commission Order, be convicted based on evidence he has not seen or heard, and that any evidence admitted against him need not comply with the admissibility or relevance rules typically applicable in criminal trials and court-martial proceedings.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government objects to our consideration of any procedural challenge at this stage on the grounds that (1) the abstention doctrine espoused in <em>Councilman</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a>, precludes pre-enforcement review of procedural rules, (2) Hamdan will be able to raise any such challenge following a &#x93;final decision&#x94; under the DTA, and (3) &#x93;there is &#x2026; no basis to presume, before the trial has even commenced, that the trial will not be conducted in good faith and according to law.&#x94;  Brief for Respondents 45&#x96;46, nn. 20&#x96;21.  The first of these contentions was disposed of in Part III, <em>supra</em>, and neither of the latter two is sound.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, because Hamdan apparently is not subject to the death penalty (at least as matters now stand) and may receive a sentence shorter than 10 years&#x92; imprisonment, he has no automatic right to review of the commission&#x92;s &#x93;final decision&#x94;<a name="ZO-44ref" href="#ZO-44" class="">

2743.  Second, contrary to the Government&#x92;s assertion, there <em>is</em> a &#x93;basis to presume&#x94; that the procedures employed during Hamdan&#x92;s trial will violate the law: The procedures are described with particularity in Commission Order No. 1, and implementation of some of them has already occurred.  One of Hamdan&#x92;s complaints is that he will be, and <em>indeed already has been</em>, excluded from his own trial.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 12; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a.  Under these circumstances, review of the procedures in advance of a &#x93;final decision&#x94;&#x97;the timing of which is left entirely to the discretion of the President under the DTA&#x97;is appropriate.  We turn, then, to consider the merits of Hamdan&#x92;s procedural challenge.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In part because the difference between military commissions and courts-martial originally was a difference of jurisdiction alone, and in part to protect against abuse and ensure evenhandedness under the pressures of war, the procedures governing trials by military commission historically have been the same as those governing courts-martial.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 1 The War of the Rebellion 248 (2d series 1894) (General Order 1 issued during the Civil War required military commissions to &#x93;be constituted in a similar manner and their proceedings be conducted according to the same general rules as courts-martial in order to prevent abuses which might otherwise arise&#x94;).  Accounts of commentators from Winthrop through General Crowder&#x97;who drafted Article of War 15 and whose views have been deemed &#x93;authoritative&#x94; by this Court, <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 353&#x97;confirm as much.<a name="ZO-45ref" href="#ZO-45" class="">

            </a>  As recently as the Korean and Vietnam wars, during which use of military commissions was contemplated but never made, the principle of procedural parity was espoused as a background assumption.  See Paust, Antiterrorism Military Commissions: Courting Illegality, 23 Mich. J. Int&#x92;l L. 1, 3&#x96;5 (2001&#x96;2002).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There is a glaring historical exception to this general rule.  The procedures and evidentiary rules used to try General Yamashita near the end of World War II deviated in significant respects from those then governing courts-martial.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/1" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 1</a>.  The force of that precedent, however, has been seriously undermined by post-World War II developments.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Yamashita, from late 1944 until September 1945, was Commanding General of the Fourteenth Army Group of the Imperial Japanese Army, which had exercised control over the Philippine Islands.  On September 3, 1945, after American forces regained control of the Philippines, Yamashita surrendered.  Three weeks later, he was charged with violations of the law of war.  A few weeks after that, he was arraigned before a military commission convened in the Philippines.  He pleaded not guilty, and his trial lasted for two months.  On December 7, 1945, Yamashita was convicted and sentenced to hang.  See <em>id.</em>, at 5; <em>id.</em>, at 31&#x96;34 (Murphy, J., dissenting).  This Court upheld the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The procedures and rules of evidence employed during Yamashita&#x92;s trial departed so far from those used in courts-martial that they generated an unusually long and vociferous critique from two Members of this Court.

            </a> Commentary: Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War 413 (1960) (hereinafter GCIII Commentary) (explaining that Article 85, which extends the Convention&#x92;s protections to &#x93;[p]risoners of war prosecuted under the laws of the Detaining Power for acts committed prior to capture,&#x94; was adopted in response to judicial interpretations of the 1929 Convention, including this Court&#x92;s decision in <em>Yamashita</em>).  The most notorious exception to the principle of uniformity, then, has been stripped of its precedential value.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The uniformity principle is not an inflexible one; it does not preclude all departures from the procedures dictated for use by courts-martial.  But any departure must be tailored to the exigency that necessitates it.  See Winthrop 835, n. 81.  That understanding is reflected in Article 36 of the UCMJ, which provides:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(a)The procedure, including modes of proof, in cases before courts-martial, courts of inquiry, military commissions, and other military tribunals may be prescribed by the President by regulations which shall, so far as he considers practicable, apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(b)All rules and regulations made under this article shall be uniform insofar as practicable and shall be reported to Congress.&#x94;  70A Stat. 50.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Article 36 places two restrictions on the President&#x92;s power to promulgate rules of procedure for courts-martial and military commissions alike.  First, no procedural rule he adopts may be &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; the UCMJ&#x97;however practical it may seem.  Second, the rules adopted must be &#x93;uniform insofar as practicable.&#x94;  That is, the rules applied to military commissions must be the same as those applied to courts-martial unless such uniformity proves impracticable.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan argues that Commission Order No. 1 violates both of these restrictions; he maintains that the procedures described in the Commission Order are inconsistent with the UCMJ and that the Government has offered no explanation for their deviation from the procedures governing courts-martial, which are set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2005 ed.) (Manual for Courts-Martial).  Among the inconsistencies Hamdan identifies is that between &#xA7;6 of the Commission Order, which permits exclusion of the accused from proceedings and denial of his access to evidence in certain circumstances, and the UCMJ&#x92;s requirement that &#x93;[a]ll &#x2026; proceedings&#x94; other than votes and deliberations by courts-martial &#x93;shall be made a part of the record and shall be in the presence of the accused.&#x94;  10  U. S. C. A. &#xA7;839(c) (Supp. 2006).  Hamdan also observes that the Commission Order dispenses with virtually all evidentiary rules applicable in courts-martial.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government has three responses.  First, it argues, only 9 of the UCMJ&#x92;s 158 Articles&#x97;the ones that expressly mention &#x93;military commissions&#x94;<a name="ZO-49ref" href="#ZO-49" class="">

            </a>&#x97;actually apply to commissions, and Commission Order No. 1 sets forth no procedure that is &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; those 9 provisions.  Second, the Government contends, military commissions would be of no use if the President were hamstrung by those provisions of the UCMJ that govern courts-martial.  Finally, the President&#x92;s determination that &#x93;the danger to the safety of the United States and the nature of international terrorism&#x94; renders it impracticable &#x93;to apply in military commissions &#x2026; the principles of law and rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts,&#x94; November 13 Order &#xA7;1(f), is, in the Government&#x92;s view, explanation enough for any deviation from court-martial procedures.  See Brief for Respondents 43&#x96;47, and n. 22.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan has the better of this argument.  Without reaching the question whether any provision of Commission Order No. 1 is strictly &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; other provisions of the UCMJ, we conclude that the &#x93;practicability&#x94; determination the President has made is insufficient to justify variances from the procedures governing courts-martial.  Subsection (b) of Article 36 was added after World War II, and requires a different showing of impracticability from the one required by subsection (a).  Subsection (a) requires that the rules the President promulgates for courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions alike conform to those that govern procedures in <em>Article III courts</em>, &#x93;so far as <em>he considers</em> practicable.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/836.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;836(a)</a> (emphasis added).  Subsection (b), by contrast, demands that the rules applied in courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions&#x97;whether or not they conform with the Federal Rules of Evidence&#x97;be &#x93;uniform <em>insofar as practicable</em>.&#x94;  &#xA7;836(b) (emphasis added).  Under the latter provision, then, the rules set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial must apply to military commissions unless impracticable.<a name="ZO-50ref" href="#ZO-50" class="">

            </a>
        </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The President here has determined, pursuant to subsection (a), that it is impracticable to apply the rules and principles of law that govern &#x93;the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts,&#x94; &#xA7;836(a), to Hamdan&#x92;s commission.  We assume that complete deference is owed that determination.  The President has not, however, made a similar official determination that it is impracticable to apply the rules for courts-martial.<a name="ZO-51ref" href="#ZO-51" class="">

                    <b>51</b>
                </sup>
            </a> And even if subsection (b)&#x92;s requirements may be satisfied without such an official determination, the requirements of that subsection are not satisfied here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the record before us demonstrates that it would be impracticable to apply court-martial rules in this case.  There is no suggestion, for example, of any logistical difficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in applying the usual principles of relevance and admissibility.  Assuming <em>arguendo</em> that the reasons articulated in the President&#x92;s Article 36(a) determination ought to be considered in evaluating the impracticability of applying court-martial rules, the only reason offered in support of that determination is the danger posed by international terrorism.<a name="ZO-52ref" href="#ZO-52" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>52</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  Without for one moment underestimating that danger, it is not evident to us why it should require, in the case of Hamdan&#x92;s trial, any variance from the rules that govern courts-martial.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The absence of any showing of impracticability is particularly disturbing when considered in light of the clear and admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamental protections afforded not just by the Manual for Courts-Martial but also by the UCMJ itself: the right to be present.  See 10  U. S. C. A. &#xA7;839(c) (Supp. 2006).  Whether or not that departure technically is &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; the terms of the UCMJ, 10  U. S. C. &#xA7;836(a), the jettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as &#x93;practicable.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Under the circumstances, then, the rules applicable in courts-martial must apply.  Since it is undisputed that Commission Order No. 1 deviates in many significant respects from those rules, it necessarily violates Article 36(b).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government&#x92;s objection that requiring compliance with the court-martial rules imposes an undue burden both ignores the plain meaning of Article 36(b) and misunderstands the purpose and the history of military commissions.  The military commission was not born of a desire to dispense a more summary form of justice than is afforded by courts-martial; it developed, rather, as a tribunal of necessity to be employed when courts-martial lacked jurisdiction over either the accused or the subject matter.  See Winthrop 831.  Exigency lent the commission its legitimacy, but did not further justify the wholesale jettisoning of procedural protections.  That history explains why the military commission&#x92;s procedures typically have been the ones used by courts-martial.  That the jurisdiction of the two tribunals today may sometimes overlap, see <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 354, does not detract from the force of this history;<a name="ZO-53ref" href="#ZO-53" class="">

            </a> Article 21 did not transform the military commission from a tribunal of true exigency into a more convenient adjudicatory tool.  Article 36, confirming as much, strikes a careful balance between uniform procedure and the need to accommodate exigencies that may sometimes arise in a theater of war.  That Article not having been complied with here, the rules specified for Hamdan&#x92;s trial are illegal.<a name="ZO-54ref" href="#ZO-54" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The procedures adopted to try Hamdan also violate the Geneva Conventions.  The Court of Appeals dismissed Hamdan&#x92;s Geneva Convention challenge on three independent grounds: (1) the Geneva Conventions are not judicially enforceable; (2) Hamdan in any event is not entitled to their protections; and (3) even if he is entitled to their protections, <em>Councilman </em>abstention is appropriate.

        <p class="opcentered">i</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals relied on <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager,</em>

, to hold that Hamdan could not invoke the Geneva Conventions to challenge the Government&#x92;s plan to prosecute him in accordance with Commission Order No. 1.  <em>Eisentrager</em> involved a challenge by 21 German nationals to their 1945 convictions for war crimes by a military tribunal convened in Nanking, China, and to their subsequent imprisonment in occupied Germany.  The petitioners argued, <em>inter alia</em>, that the 1929 Geneva Convention rendered illegal some of the procedures employed during their trials, which they said deviated impermissibly from the procedures used by courts-martial to try American soldiers.  See <em>id.</em>, at 789.  We rejected that claim on the merits because the petitioners (unlike Hamdan here) had failed to identify any prejudicial disparity &#x93;between the Commission that tried [them] and those that would try an offending soldier of the American forces of like rank,&#x94; and in any event could claim no protection, under the 1929 Convention, during trials for crimes that occurred before their confinement as prisoners of war.  <em>Id.</em>, at 790.<a name="ZO-56ref" href="#ZO-56" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Buried in a footnote of the opinion, however, is this curious statement suggesting that the Court lacked power even to consider the merits of the Geneva Convention argument:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;We are not holding that these prisoners have no right which the military authorities are bound to respect.  The United States, by the Geneva Convention of July 27, 1929,

2021, concluded with forty-six other countries, including the German Reich, an agreement upon the treatment to be accorded captives.  These prisoners claim to be and are entitled to its protection.  It is, however, the obvious scheme of the Agreement that responsibility for observance and enforcement of these rights is upon political and military authorities.  Rights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only through protests and intervention of protecting powers as the rights of our citizens against foreign governments are vindicated only by Presidential intervention.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 789, n. 14.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The Court of Appeals, on the strength of this footnote, held that &#x93;the 1949 Geneva Convention does not confer upon Hamdan a right to enforce its provisions in court.&#x94;  415 F. 3d, at 40.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Whatever else might be said about the <em>Eisentrager</em> footnote, it does not control this case.

, they are, as the Government does not dispute, part of the law of war.  See <em>Hamdi, </em>542 U. S., at 520&#x96;521 (plurality opinion).  And compliance with the law of war is the condition upon which the authority set forth in Article 21 is granted.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">ii</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For the Court of Appeals, acknowledgment of that condition was no bar to Hamdan&#x92;s trial by commission.  As an alternative to its holding that Hamdan could not invoke the Geneva Conventions at all, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Conventions did not in any event apply to the armed conflict during which Hamdan was captured.  The court accepted the Executive&#x92;s assertions that Hamdan was captured in connection with the United States&#x92; war with al Qaeda and that that war is distinct from the war with the Taliban in Afghanistan.  It further reasoned that the war with al Qaeda evades the reach of the Geneva Conventions.  See 415 F. 3d, at 41&#x96;42. We, like Judge Williams, disagree with the latter conclusion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The conflict with al Qaeda is not, according to the Government, a conflict to which the full protections afforded detainees under the 1949 Geneva Conventions apply because Article 2 of those Conventions (which appears in all four Conventions) renders the full protections applicable only to &#x93;all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties.&#x94;  6 U.

One such provision prohibits &#x93;the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals thought, and the Government asserts, that Common Article 3 does not apply to Hamdan because the conflict with al Qaeda, being &#x93; &#x91;international in scope,&#x92; &#x94; does not qualify as a &#x93; &#x91;conflict not of an international character.&#x92; &#x94;  415 F. 3d, at 41.  That reasoning is erroneous.  The term &#x93;conflict not of an international character&#x94; is used here in contradistinction to a conflict between nations.  So much is demonstrated by the &#x93;fundamental logic [of] the Convention&#x92;s provisions on its application.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 44 (Williams, J., concurring).  Common Article 2 provides that &#x93;the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties.&#x94;  6 U. S. T., at 3318 (Art. 2, &#xB6;1).  High Contracting Parties (signatories) also must abide by all terms of the Conventions vis-&amp;Agrave;-vis one another even if one party to the conflict is a nonsignatory &#x93;Power,&#x94; and must so abide vis-&amp;Agrave;-vis the nonsignatory if &#x93;the latter accepts and applies&#x94; those terms.  <em>Ibid.</em> (Art. 2, &#xB6;3).  Common Article 3, by contrast, affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory &#x93;Power&#x94; who are involved in a conflict &#x93;in the territory of&#x94; a signatory.  The latter kind of conflict is distinguishable from the conflict described in Common Article 2 chiefly because it does not involve a clash between nations (whether signatories or not).  In context, then, the phrase &#x93;not of an international character&#x94; bears its literal meaning.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, J. Bentham, Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation 6, 296 (J. Burns &amp; H. Hart eds. 1970) (using the term &#x93;international law&#x94; as a &#x93;new though not inexpressive appellation&#x94; meaning &#x93;betwixt nation and nation&#x94;; defining &#x93;international&#x94; to include &#x93;mutual transactions between sovereigns as such&#x94;); Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, p. 1351 (1987) (&#x93;[A] non-international armed conflict is distinct from an international armed conflict because of the legal status of the entities opposing each other&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Although the official commentaries accompanying Common Article 3 indicate that an important purpose of the provision was to furnish minimal protection to rebels involved in one kind of &#x93;conflict not of an international character,&#x94; <em>i.e.</em>, a civil war, see GCIII Commentary 36&#x96;37, the commentaries also make clear &#x93;that the scope of the Article must be as wide as possible,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 36.<a name="ZO-63ref" href="#ZO-63" class="">

None of those cases says that the absence of an express provision reserving jurisdiction over pending cases trumps or renders irrelevant any other indications of congressional intent.  Indeed, Bruner itself relied on such other indications&#x96;including a negative inference drawn from the statutory text, cf. infra, at 13&#x96;to support its conclusion that jurisdiction was not available.   The Court observed that (1) Congress had been put on notice by prior lower court cases addressing the Tucker Act that it ought to specifically reserve jurisdiction over pending cases, see 343 U. S., at 115, and (2) in contrast to the congressional silence concerning reservation of jurisdiction, reservation had been made of &#x93; &#x91;any rights or liabilities&#x92; existing at the effective date of the Act&#x94; repealed by another provision of the Act, ibid., n. 7.

).  Certainly, the &#x93;effective date&#x94; provision cannot bear the weight Justice Scalia would place on it.  See post, at 5, and n. 1.  Congress deemed that provision insufficient, standing alone, to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable to pending cases; hence its adoption of subsection (h)(2).  Justice Scalia seeks to avoid reducing subsection (h)(2) to a mere redundancy&#x97;a consequence he seems to acknowledge must otherwise follow from his interpretation&#x97;by speculating that Congress had special reasons, not also relevant to subsection (e)(1), to worry that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) would be ruled inapplicable to pending cases.  As we explain infra, at 17, and n. 12, that attempt fails.

        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-10" href="#ZO-10ref">10</a> We note that statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to what the text of the DTA and its drafting history already make plain.  Senator Levin, one of the sponsors of the final bill, objected to earlier versions of the Act&#x92;s &#x93;effective date&#x94; provision that would have made subsection (e)(1) applicable to pending cases.  See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. S12667 (Nov. 10, 2005) (amendment proposed by Sen. Graham that would have rendered what is now subsection (e)(1) applicable to &#x93;any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act&#x94;).  Senator Levin urged adoption of an alternative amendment that &#x93;would apply only to new habeas cases filed after the date of enactment.&#x94;  Id., at S12802 (Nov. 15, 2005).  That alternative amendment became the text of subsection (h)(2).  (In light of the extensive discussion of the DTA&#x92;s effect on pending cases prior to passage of the Act, see, e.g., id., at S12664 (Nov. 10, 2005); id., at S12755 (Nov. 14, 2005); id., at S12799&#x96;S12802 (Nov. 15, 2005); id., at S14245, S14252&#x96;S14253, S14257&#x96;S14258, S14274&#x96;S14275 (Dec. 21, 2005), it cannot be said that the changes to subsection (h)(2) were inconsequential.  Cf. post, at 14 (Scalia, J., dissenting).)


While statements attributed to the final bill&#x92;s two other sponsors, Senators Graham and Kyl, arguably contradict Senator Levin&#x92;s contention that the final version of the Act preserved jurisdiction over pending habeas cases, see 151 Cong. Rec. S14263&#x96;S14264 (Dec. 21, 2005), those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record after the Senate debate.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 5, n. 6; see also 151 Cong. Rec. S14260 (statement of Sen. Kyl) (&#x93;I would like to say a few words about the now-completed National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006&#x94; (emphasis added)).  All statements made during the debate itself support Senator Levin&#x92;s understanding that the final text of the DTA would not render subsection (e)(1) applicable to pending cases.  See, e.g., id., at S14245, S14252&#x96;S14253, S14274&#x96;S14275 (Dec. 21, 2005).  The statements that Justice Scalia cites as evidence to the contrary construe subsection (e)(3) to strip this Court of jurisdiction, see post, at 12, n. 4 (dissenting opinion) (quoting 151 Cong. Rec. S12796 (Nov. 15, 2005) (statement of Sen. Specter))&#x97;a construction that the Government has expressly disavowed in this litigation, see n. 11, infra.  The inapposite November 14, 2005, statement of Senator Graham, which Justice Scalia cites as evidence of that Senator&#x92;s &#x93;assumption that pending cases are covered,&#x94; post, at 12, and n. 3 (citing 151 Cong. Rec. S12756 (Nov. 14, 2005)), follows directly after the uncontradicted statement of his co-sponsor, Senator Levin, assuring members of the Senate that &#x93;the amendment will not strip the courts of jurisdiction over [pending] cases.&#x94;  Id., at S12755.

In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals conflated two distinct inquiries: (1) whether Hamdan has raised a substantial argument that the military commission lacks authority to try him; and, more fundamentally, (2) whether the comity considerations underlying Councilman apply to trigger the abstention principle in the first place.  As the Court of Appeals acknowledged at the beginning of its opinion, the first question warrants consideration only if the answer to the second is yes.  See 415 F. 3d, at 36&#x96;37.  Since, as the Court of Appeals properly concluded, the answer to the second question is in fact no, there is no need to consider any exception.


At any rate, it appears that the exception would apply here.  As discussed in Part VI, infra, Hamdan raises a substantial argument that, because the military commission that has been convened to try him is not a &#x93; &#x91;regularly constituted court&#x92; &#x94; under the Geneva Conventions, it is ultra vires and thus lacks jurisdiction over him.

&#x93;If, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, then, on the theatre of active military operations, where war really prevails, there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society; and as no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course.  As necessity creates the rule, so it limits its duration; for, if this government is continued after the courts are reinstated, it is a gross usurpation of power.  Martial rule can never exist where the courts are open, and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction.  It is also confined to the locality of actual war.&#x94;  4 Wall., at 127 (emphases in original).

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-27" href="#ZO-27ref">27</a> So much may not be evident on cold review of the Civil War trials often cited as precedent for this kind of tribunal because the commissions established during that conflict operated as both martial law or military government tribunals and law-of-war commissions.  Hence, &#x93;military commanders began the practice [during the Civil War] of using the same name, the same rules, and often the same tribunals&#x94; to try both ordinary crimes and war crimes.  Bickers, 34 Tex. Tech. L. Rev., at 908.  &#x93;For the first time, accused horse thieves and alleged saboteurs found themselves subject to trial by the same military commission.&#x94;  Id., at 909.  The Civil War precedents must therefore be considered with caution; as we recognized in Quirin, 317 U.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-31" href="#ZO-31ref">31</a> Justice Thomas would treat Osama bin Laden&#x92;s 1996 declaration of jihad against Americans as the inception of the war.   See post, at 7&#x96;10 (dissenting opinion).  But even the Government does not go so far; although the United States had for some time prior to the attacks of September 11, 2001, been aggressively pursuing al Qaeda, neither in the charging document nor in submissions before this Court has the Government asserted that the President&#x92;s war powers were activated prior to September 11, 2001.  Cf. Brief for Respondents 25 (describing the events of September 11, 2001, as &#x93;an act of war&#x94; that &#x93;triggered a right to deploy military forces abroad to defend the United States by combating al Qaeda&#x94;).  Justice Thomas&#x92; further argument that the AUMF is &#x93;backward looking&#x94; and therefore authorizes trial by military commission of crimes that occurred prior to the inception of war is insupportable.  See post, at 8, n. 3.  If nothing else, Article 21 of the UCMJ requires that the President comply with the law of war in his use of military commissions.  As explained in the text, the law of war permits trial only of offenses &#x93;committed within the period of the war.&#x94;  Winthrop 837; see also Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28&#x96;29 (observing that law-of-war military commissions may be used to try &#x93;those enemies who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have violated the law of war&#x94; (emphasis added)).  The sources that Justice Thomas relies on to suggest otherwise simply do not support his position.  Colonel Green&#x92;s short exegesis on military commissions cites Howland for the proposition that &#x93;[o]ffenses committed before a formal declaration of war or before the declaration of martial law may be tried by military commission.&#x94;  The Military Commission, 42 Am. J. Int&#x92;l L. 832, 848 (1948) (emphases added) (cited post, at 9&#x96;10).  Assuming that to be true, nothing in our analysis turns on the admitted absence of either a formal declaration of war or a declaration of martial law.  Our focus instead is on the September 11, 2001 attacks that the Government characterizes as the relevant &#x93;act[s] of war,&#x94; and on the measure that authorized the President&#x92;s deployment of military force&#x97;the AUMF.   Because we do not question the Government&#x92;s position that the war commenced with the events of September 11, 2001, the Prize Cases, 
2Black
635 (1863) (cited post, at 2, 7, 8, and 10 (Thomas, J., dissenting)), are not germane to the analysis.


Finally, Justice Thomas&#x92; assertion that Julius Otto Kuehn&#x92;s trial by military commission &#x93;for conspiring with Japanese officials to betray the United States fleet to the Imperial Japanese Government prior to its attack on Pearl Harbor&#x94; stands as authoritative precedent for Hamdan&#x92;s trial by commission, post, at 9, misses the mark in three critical respects.  First, Kuehn was tried for the federal espionage crimes under what were then 50 U. S C. &#xA7;&#xA7;31, 32, and 34, not with common-law violations of the law of war.  See Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 30, pp. 3067&#x96;3069 (1946).  Second, he was tried by martial law commission (a kind of commission Justice Thomas acknowledges is not relevant to the analysis here, and whose jurisdiction extends to offenses committed within &#x93;the exercise of . . . martial law,&#x94; Winthrop 837, see supra, n. 28), not a commission established exclusively to try violations of the law of war.  See ibid.   Third, the martial law commissions established to try crimes in Hawaii were ultimately declared illegal by this Court.  See Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/304" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 304</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">324</a> (1946)
 (&#x93;The phrase &#x91;martial law&#x92; as employed in [the Hawaiian Organic Act], while intended to authorize the military to act vigorously for the maintenance of an orderly civil government and for the defense of the Islands against actual or threatened rebellion or invasion, was not intended to authorize the supplanting of courts by military tribunals&#x94;).
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-32" href="#ZO-32ref">32</a> Justice Thomas adopts the remarkable view, not advocated by the Government, that the charging document in this case actually includes more than one charge: Conspiracy and several other ill-defined crimes, like &#x93;joining an organization&#x94; that has a criminal purpose, &#x93; &#x91;[b]eing a guerilla,&#x92; &#x94; and aiding the enemy.  See post, at 16&#x96;21, and n. 9.  There are innumerable problems with this approach.


First, the crimes Justice Thomas identifies were not actually charged.  It is one thing to observe that charges before a military commission &#x93; &#x91;need not be stated with the precision of a common law indictment,&#x92; &#x94; post, at 15, n. 7 (citation omitted); it is quite another to say that a crime not charged may nonetheless be read into an indictment.   Second, the Government plainly had available to it the tools and the time it needed to charge petitioner with the various crimes Justice Thomas refers to, if it believed they were supported by the allegations.  As Justice Thomas himself observes, see post, at 21, the crime of aiding the enemy may, in circumstances where the accused owes allegiance to the party whose enemy he is alleged to have aided, be triable by military commission pursuant to Article 104 of the UCMJ, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/904.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;904</a>.  Indeed, the Government has charged detainees under this provision when it has seen fit to do so.  See Brief for David Hicks as Amicus Curiae 7.


Third, the cases Justice Thomas relies on to show that Hamdan may be guilty of violations of the law of war not actually charged do not support his argument.  Justice Thomas begins by blurring the distinction between those categories of &#x93;offender&#x94; who may be tried by military commission (e.g., jayhawkers and the like) with the &#x93;offenses&#x94; that may be so tried.  Even when it comes to &#x93; &#x91;being a guerilla,&#x92; &#x94; cf. post, at 18, n. 9 (citation omitted), a label alone does not render a person susceptible to execution or other criminal punishment; the charge of &#x93; &#x91;being a guerilla&#x92; &#x94; invariably is accompanied by the allegation that the defendant &#x93; &#x91;took up arms&#x92; &#x94; as such.  This is because, as explained by Judge Advocate General Holt in a decision upholding the charge of &#x93; &#x91;being a guerilla&#x92; &#x94; as one recognized by &#x93;the universal usage of the times,&#x94; the charge is simply shorthand (akin to &#x93;being a spy&#x94;) for &#x93;the perpetration of a succession of similar acts&#x94; of violence.  Record Books of the Judge Advocate General Office, R. 3, 590.   The sources cited by Justice Thomas confirm as much.  See cases cited post, at 18, n. 9.


Likewise, the suggestion that the Nuremberg precedents support Hamdan&#x92;s conviction for the (uncharged) crime of joining a criminal organization must fail.  Cf. post, at 19&#x96;21.  The convictions of certain high-level Nazi officials for &#x93;membership in a criminal organization&#x94; were secured pursuant to specific provisions of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal that permitted indictment of individual organization members following convictions of the organizations themselves.  See Arts. 9 and 10, in 1 Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal 12 (1947).   The initial plan to use organizations&#x92; convictions as predicates for mass individual trials ultimately was abandoned.  See T. Taylor, Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir 584&#x96;585, 638 (1992).

Although the charge against the defendants in that case accused them of &#x93;combining, confederating, and conspiring together&#x94; to murder the President, they were also charged (as we read the indictment, cf. post, at 23, n. 14 (Thomas, J., dissenting)) with &#x93;maliciously, unlawfully, and traitorously murdering the said Abraham Lincoln.&#x94;  H.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), drawing on the Nuremberg precedents, has adopted a &#x93;joint criminal enterprise&#x94; theory of liability, but that is a species of liability for the substantive offense (akin to aiding and abetting), not a crime on its own.

But even if Congress was concerned with ensuring uniformity across service branches, that does not mean it did not also intend to codify the longstanding practice of procedural parity between courts-martial and other military tribunals.  Indeed, the suggestion that Congress did not intend uniformity across tribunal types is belied by the textual proximity of subsection (a) (which requires that the rules governing criminal trials in federal district courts apply, absent the President&#x92;s determination of impracticability, to courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions alike) and subsection (b) (which imposes the uniformity requirement).

Not only did Madsen not involve a law-of-war military commission, but (1) the petitioner there did not challenge the procedures used to try her, (2) the UCMJ, with its new Article 36(b), did not become effective until May 31, 1951, after the petitioner&#x92;s trial,  see 343 U.

            <span class="smallcaps">Justice Stevens</span> announced the judgment of the Court and delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I through IV, Parts VI through VI&#x96;D&#x96;iii, Part VI&#x96;D&#x96;v, and Part VII, and an opinion with respect to Parts V and VI&#x96;D&#x96;iv, in which <span class="smallcaps">Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, </span>and <span class="smallcaps">Justice Breyer</span> join.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni national, is in custody at an American prison in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.  In November 2001, during hostilities between the United States and the Taliban (which then governed Afghanistan), Hamdan was captured by militia forces and turned over to the U. S. military.  In June 2002, he was transported to Guantanamo Bay.  Over a year later, the President deemed him eligible for trial by military commission for then-unspecified crimes.  After another year had passed, Hamdan was charged with one count of conspiracy &#x93;to commit &#x2026; offenses triable by military commission.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan filed petitions for writs of habeas corpus and mandamus to challenge the Executive Branch&#x92;s intended means of prosecuting this charge.  He concedes that a court-martial constituted in accordance with the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/801.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;801</a>
            <em>et seq.</em> (2000 ed. and Supp. III), would have authority to try him.  His objection is that the military commission the President has convened lacks such authority, for two principal reasons: First, neither congressional Act nor the common law of war supports trial by this commission for the crime of conspiracy&#x97;an offense that, Hamdan says, is not a violation of the law of war.  Second, Hamdan contends, the procedures that the President has adopted to try him violate the most basic tenets of military and international law, including the principle that a defendant must be permitted to see and hear the evidence against him.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The District Court granted Hamdan&#x92;s request for a writ of habeas corpus.  344 F. Supp. 2d 152 (DC 2004).  The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  415 F. 3d 33 (2005).  Recognizing, as we did over a half-century ago, that trial by military commission is an extraordinary measure raising important questions about the balance of powers in our constitutional structure, <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>

, we granted certiorari.  546 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the military commission convened to try Hamdan lacks power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate both the UCMJ and the Geneva Conventions.  Four of us also conclude, see Part V, <em>infra</em>, that the offense with which Hamdan has been charged is not an &#x93;offens[e] that by &#x2026; the law of war may be tried by military commissions.&#x94;  10  U.

        <p class="bodytext">    Congress responded by adopting a Joint Resolution authorizing the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks &#x2026; in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF),

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1541.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. &#xA7;1541</a> (2000 ed., Supp. III).  Acting pursuant to the AUMF, and having determined that the Taliban regime had supported al Qaeda, the President ordered the Armed Forces of the United States to invade Afghanistan.  In the ensuing hostilities, hundreds of individuals, Hamdan among them, were captured and eventually detained at Guantanamo Bay.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On November 13, 2001, while the United States was still engaged in active combat with the Taliban, the President issued a comprehensive military order intended to govern the &#x93;Detention, Treatment, and Trial of Certain Non-Citizens in the War Against Terrorism,&#x94; 66 Fed. Reg. 57833 (hereinafter November 13 Order or Order).  Those subject to the November 13 Order include any noncitizen for whom the President determines &#x93;there is reason to believe&#x94; that he or she (1) &#x93;is or was&#x94; a member of al Qaeda or (2) has engaged or participated in terrorist activities aimed at or harmful to the United States.  <em>Id.</em>, at 57834.  Any such individual &#x93;shall, when tried, be tried by military commission for any and all offenses triable by military commission that such individual is alleged to have committed, and may be punished in accordance with the penalties provided under applicable law, including imprisonment or death.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  The November 13 Order vested in the Secretary of Defense the power to appoint military commissions to try individuals subject to the Order, but that power has since been delegated to John D. Altenberg, Jr., a retired Army major general and longtime military lawyer who has been designated &#x93;Appointing Authority for Military Commissions.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On July 3, 2003, the President announced his determination that Hamdan and five other detainees at Guantanamo Bay were subject to the November 13 Order and thus triable by military commission.  In December 2003, military counsel was appointed to represent Hamdan.  Two months later, counsel filed demands for charges and for a speedy trial pursuant to Article 10 of the UCMJ, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/810.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;810</a>.  On February 23, 2004, the legal adviser to the Appointing Authority denied the applications, ruling that Hamdan was not entitled to any of the protections of the UCMJ.  Not until July 13, 2004, after Hamdan had commenced this action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, did the Government finally charge him with the offense for which, a year earlier, he had been deemed eligible for trial by military commission.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The charging document, which is unsigned, contains 13 numbered paragraphs.  The first two paragraphs recite the asserted bases for the military commission&#x92;s jurisdiction&#x97;namely, the November 13 Order and the President&#x92;s July 3, 2003, declaration that Hamdan is eligible for trial by military commission.  The next nine paragraphs, collectively entitled &#x93;General Allegations,&#x94; describe al Qaeda&#x92;s activities from its inception in 1989 through 2001 and identify Osama bin Laden as the group&#x92;s leader.  Hamdan is not mentioned in these paragraphs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Only the final two paragraphs, entitled &#x93;Charge: Conspiracy,&#x94; contain allegations against Hamdan.  Paragraph 12 charges that &#x93;from on or about February 1996 to on or about November 24, 2001,&#x94; Hamdan &#x93;willfully and knowingly joined an enterprise of persons who shared a common criminal purpose and conspired and agreed with [named members of al Qaeda] to commit the following offenses triable by military commission: attacking civilians; attacking civilian objects; murder by an unprivileged belligerent; and terrorism.&#x94;  App. to Pet. for Cert. 65a.  There is no allegation that Hamdan had any command responsibilities, played a leadership role, or participated in the planning of any activity.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Paragraph 13 lists four &#x93;overt acts&#x94; that Hamdan is alleged to have committed sometime between 1996 and November 2001 in furtherance of the &#x93;enterprise and conspiracy&#x94;: (1) he acted as Osama bin Laden&#x92;s &#x93;bodyguard and personal driver,&#x94; &#x93;believ[ing]&#x94; all the while that bin Laden &#x93;and his associates were involved in&#x94; terrorist acts prior to and including the attacks of September 11, 2001; (2) he arranged for transportation of, and actually transported, weapons used by al Qaeda members and by bin Laden&#x92;s bodyguards (Hamdan among them); (3) he &#x93;drove or accompanied [O]sama bin Laden to various al Qaida-sponsored training camps, press conferences, or lectures,&#x94; at which bin Laden encouraged attacks against Americans; and (4) he received weapons training at al Qaeda-sponsored camps.  <em>Id.</em>, at 65a&#x96;67a.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    After this formal charge was filed, the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington transferred Hamdan&#x92;s habeas and mandamus petitions to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  Meanwhile, a Combatant Status Review Tribunal (CSRT) convened pursuant to a military order issued on July 7, 2004, decided that Hamdan&#x92;s continued detention at Guantanamo Bay was warranted because he was an &#x93;enemy combatant.&#x94;<a name="ZO-1ref" href="#ZO-1" class="">

            </a>  Separately, proceedings before the military commission commenced.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On November 8, 2004, however, the District Court granted Hamdan&#x92;s petition for habeas corpus and stayed the commission&#x92;s proceedings.  It concluded that the President&#x92;s authority to establish military commissions extends only to &#x93;offenders or offenses triable by military [commission] under the law of war,&#x94; 344 F. Supp. 2d, at 158; that the law of war includes the Geneva Convention (III) Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War, Aug. 12, 1949, [1955] 6 U. S. T. 3316, T. I. A. S. No. 3364 (Third Geneva Convention); that Hamdan is entitled to the full protections of the Third Geneva Convention until adjudged, in compliance with that treaty, not to be a prisoner of war; and that, whether or not Hamdan is properly classified as a prisoner of war, the military commission convened to try him was established in violation of both the UCMJ and Common Article 3 of the Third Geneva Convention because it had the power to convict based on evidence the accused would never see or hear.  344 F. Supp. 2d, at 158&#x96;172.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit reversed.  Like the District Court, the Court of Appeals declined the Government&#x92;s invitation to abstain from considering Hamdan&#x92;s challenge.  Cf. <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman,</em>

.  On the merits, the panel rejected the District Court&#x92;s further conclusion that Hamdan was entitled to relief under the Third Geneva Convention.  All three judges agreed that the Geneva Conventions were not &#x93;judicially enforceable,&#x94; 415 F. 3d, at 38, and two thought that the Conventions did not in any event apply to Hamdan, <em>id.</em>, at 40&#x96;42; but see <em>id.</em>, at 44 (Williams, J., concurring).  In other portions of its opinion, the court concluded that our decision in <em>Quirin</em> foreclosed any separation-of-powers objection to the military commission&#x92;s jurisdiction, and held that Hamdan&#x92;s trial before the contemplated commission would violate neither the UCMJ nor U. S. Armed Forces regulations intended to implement the Geneva Conventions.  415 F. 3d, at 38, 42&#x96;43.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    On November 7, 2005, we granted certiorari to decide whether the military commission convened to try Hamdan has authority to do so, and whether Hamdan may rely on the Geneva Conventions in these proceedings.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    On February 13, 2006, the Government filed a motion to dismiss the writ of certiorari.  The ground cited for dismissal was the recently enacted Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (DTA), Pub. L. 109&#x96;148, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2739.  We postponed our ruling on that motion pending argument on the merits, 546 U. S. ___ (2006), and now deny it.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The DTA, which was signed into law on December 30, 2005, addresses a broad swath of subjects related to detainees.  It places restrictions on the treatment and interrogation of detainees in U. S. custody, and it furnishes procedural protections for U. S. personnel accused of engaging in improper interrogation.  DTA &#xA7;&#xA7;1002&#x96;1004,

Subsections (a) through (d) of &#xA7;1005 direct the Secretary of Defense to report to Congress the procedures being used by CSRTs to determine the proper classification of detainees held in Guantanamo Bay, Iraq, and Afghanistan, and to adopt certain safeguards as part of those procedures.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Subsection (e) of &#xA7;1005, which is entitled &#x93;<span class="smallcaps">Judicial Review of Detention of Enemy Combatants</span>,&#x94; supplies the basis for the Government&#x92;s jurisdictional argument.

The Act is silent about whether paragraph (1) of subsection (e) &#x93;shall apply&#x94; to claims pending on the date of enactment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government argues that &#xA7;&#xA7;1005(e)(1) and 1005(h) had the immediate effect, upon enactment, of repealing federal jurisdiction not just over detainee habeas actions yet to be filed but also over any such actions then pending in any federal court&#x97;including this Court.  Accordingly, it argues, we lack jurisdiction to review the Court of Appeals&#x92; decision below.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan objects to this theory on both constitutional and statutory grounds.  Principal among his constitutional arguments is that the Government&#x92;s preferred reading raises grave questions about Congress&#x92; authority to impinge upon this Court&#x92;s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases.  Support for this argument is drawn from <em>Ex parte Yerger,</em>8Wall.
85 (1869), in which, having explained that &#x93;the denial to this court of appellate jurisdiction&#x94; to consider an original writ of habeas corpus would &#x93;greatly weaken the efficacy of the writ,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 102&#x96;103, we held that Congress would not be presumed to have effected such denial absent an unmistakably clear statement to the contrary.  See <em>id.</em>, at 104&#x96;105; see also <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin,</em>

            </a> could not have been &#x93;a plainer instance of positive exception&#x94;).  Hamdan also suggests that, if the Government&#x92;s reading is correct, Congress has unconstitutionally suspended the writ of habeas corpus.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    We find it unnecessary to reach either of these arguments.  Ordinary principles of statutory construction suffice to rebut the Government&#x92;s theory&#x97;at least insofar as this case, which was pending at the time the DTA was enacted, is concerned.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government acknowledges that only paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (e) are expressly made applicable to pending cases, see &#xA7;1005(h)(2), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743&#x96;2744, but argues that the omission of paragraph (1) from the scope of that express statement is of no moment.  This is so, we are told, because Congress&#x92; failure to expressly reserve federal courts&#x92; jurisdiction over pending cases erects a presumption against jurisdiction, and that presumption is rebutted by neither the text nor the legislative history of the DTA.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The first part of this argument is not entirely without support in our precedents.

            </a>  If a statutory provision &#x93;would operate retroactively&#x94; as applied to cases pending at the time the provision was enacted, then &#x93;our traditional presumption teaches that it does not govern absent clear congressional intent favoring such a result.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 280.  We have explained, however, that, unlike other intervening changes in the law, a jurisdiction-conferring or jurisdiction-stripping statute usually &#x93;takes away no substantive right but simply changes the tribunal that is to hear the case.&#x94;  <em>Hallowell</em>, 239 U. S., at 508.  If that is truly all the statute does, no retroactivity problem arises because the change in the law does not &#x93;impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party&#x92;s liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U.

            </a>  A familiar principle of statutory construction, relevant both in <em>Lindh</em> and here, is that a negative inference may be drawn from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute.  See <em>id.</em>, at 330; see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Russello</em> v. <em>United States,</em>

 (&#x93; &#x91;[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion&#x92; &#x94;).  The Court in <em>Lindh</em> relied on this reasoning to conclude that certain limitations on the availability of habeas relief imposed by AEDPA applied only to cases filed after that statute&#x92;s effective date.  Congress&#x92; failure to identify the temporal reach of those limitations, which governed noncapital cases, stood in contrast to its express command in the same legislation that new rules governing habeas petitions in capital cases &#x93;apply to cases pending on or after the date of enactment.&#x94;  &#xA7;107(c), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">110</a>Stat.
1226; see <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329&#x96;330.  That contrast, combined with the fact that the amendments at issue &#x93;affect[ed] substantive entitlement to relief,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 327, warranted drawing a negative inference.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A like inference follows <em>a fortiori </em>from <em>Lindh</em> in this case.  &#x93;If &#x2026; Congress was reasonably concerned to ensure that [&#xA7;&#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)] be applied to pending cases, it should have been just as concerned about [&#xA7;1005(e)(1)], unless it had the different intent that the latter [section] not be applied to the general run of pending cases.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  If anything, the evidence of deliberate omission is stronger here than it was in <em>Lindh</em>.  In <em>Lindh</em>, the provisions to be contrasted had been drafted separately but were later &#x93;joined together and &#x2026; considered simultaneously when the language raising the implication was inserted.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 330.  We observed that Congress&#x92; tandem review and approval of the two sets of provisions strengthened the presumption that the relevant omission was deliberate.  <em>Id.</em>, at 331; see also <em>Field</em> v. <em>Mans,</em>

 (&#x93;The more apparently deliberate the contrast, the stronger the inference, as applied, for example, to contrasting statutory sections originally enacted simultaneously in relevant respects&#x94;).  Here, Congress not only considered the respective temporal reaches of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (e) together at every stage, but omitted paragraph (1) from its directive that paragraphs (2) and (3) apply to pending cases only after having <em>rejected</em> earlier proposed versions of the statute that would have included what is now paragraph (1) within the scope of that directive.

        <p class="bodytext">    The Government nonetheless offers two reasons why, in its view, no negative inference may be drawn in favor of jurisdiction.  First, it asserts that <em>Lindh</em> is inapposite because &#x93;Section 1005(e)(1) and (h)(1) remove jurisdiction, while Section 1005(e)(2), (3) and (h)(2) create an exclusive review mechanism and define the nature of that review.&#x94;  Reply Brief in Support of Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss 4.

        <p class="bodytext">    The Government&#x92;s second objection is that applying subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) but not (e)(1) to pending cases &#x93;produces an absurd result&#x94; because it grants (albeit only temporarily) dual jurisdiction over detainees&#x92; cases in circumstances where the statute plainly envisions that the District of Columbia Circuit will have &#x93;<em>exclusive</em>&#x94; and immediate jurisdiction over such cases.

But the premise here is faulty; subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) grant jurisdiction only over actions to &#x93;determine the validity of any final decision&#x94; of a CSRT or commission.  Because Hamdan, at least, is not contesting any &#x93;final decision&#x94; of a CSRT or military commission, his action does not fall within the scope of subsection (e)(2) or (e)(3).  There is, then, no absurdity.<a name="ZO-14ref" href="#ZO-14" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    The Government&#x92;s more general suggestion that Congress can have had no good reason for preserving habeas jurisdiction over cases that had been brought by detainees prior to enactment of the DTA not only is belied by the legislative history, see n. 10, <em>supra</em>, but is otherwise without merit.  There is nothing absurd about a scheme under which pending habeas actions&#x97;particularly those, like this one, that challenge the very legitimacy of the tribunals whose judgments Congress would like to have reviewed&#x97;are preserved, and more routine challenges to final decisions rendered by those tribunals are carefully channeled to a particular court and through a particular lens of review.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, we cannot leave unaddressed <span class="smallcaps">Justice Scalia</span>&#x92;s contentions that the &#x93;meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear,&#x94; <em>post</em>, at 6, and that &#x93;the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed,&#x94; <em>post</em>, at 3 (emphasis in original).  Only by treating the <em>Bruner</em> rule as an inflexible trump (a thing it has never been, see n. 7, <em>supra</em>) and ignoring both the rest of &#xA7;1005&#x92;s text and its drafting history can one conclude as much.  Congress here expressly provided that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applied to pending cases.  It chose not to so provide&#x97;after having been presented with the option&#x97;for subsection (e)(1).  The omission is an integral part of the statutory scheme that muddies whatever &#x93;plain meaning&#x94; may be discerned from blinkered study of subsection (e)(1) alone.  The dissent&#x92;s speculation about what Congress might have intended by the omission not only is counterfactual, cf. n. 10, <em>supra</em> (recounting legislative history), but rests on both a misconstruction of the DTA and an erroneous view our precedents, see <em>supra</em>, at 17, and n. 12.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    In <em>Councilman</em>, an army officer on active duty was referred to a court-martial for trial on charges that he violated the UCMJ by selling, transferring, and possessing marijuana.  420 U.

Objecting that the alleged offenses were not &#x93; &#x91;service connected,&#x92; &#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 740, the officer filed suit in Federal District Court to enjoin the proceedings.  He neither questioned the lawfulness of courts-martial or their procedures nor disputed that, as a serviceman, he was subject to court-martial jurisdiction.  His sole argument was that the subject matter of his case did not fall within the scope of court-martial authority.  See <em>id.</em>, at 741, 759.  The District Court granted his request for injunctive relief, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>

            <em>Councilman</em> identifies two considerations of comity that together favor abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings against service personnel.

First, military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts.  See <em>Councilman</em>, 420 U. S., at 752.  Second, federal courts should respect the balance that Congress struck between military preparedness and fairness to individual service members when it created &#x93;an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals, consisting of civilian judges &#x91;completely removed from all military influence or persuasion &#x2026; .&#x92; &#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 758 (quoting H.

        <p class="bodytext">    The same cannot be said here; indeed, neither of the comity considerations identified in <em>Councilman </em>weighs in favor of abstention in this case.  First, Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.  Second, the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.  Unlike the officer in <em>Councilman</em>,<em/>Hamdan has no right to appeal any conviction to the civilian judges of the Court of Military Appeals (now called the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, see Pub.

Instead, under Dept. of Defense Military Commission Order No. 1 (Commission Order No. 1), which was issued by the President on March 21, 2002, and amended most recently on August 31, 2005, and which governs the procedures for Hamdan&#x92;s commission, any conviction would be reviewed by a panel consisting of three military officers designated by the Secretary of Defense.  Commission Order No. 1 &#xA7;6(H)(4).

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, neither of the two comity considerations underlying our decision to abstain in <em>Councilman</em> applies to the circumstances of this case.  Instead, this Court&#x92;s decision in <em>Quirin</em> is the most relevant precedent.  In <em>Quirin</em>, seven German saboteurs were captured upon arrival by submarine in New York and Florida.  317 U. S., at 21.  The President convened a military commission to try the saboteurs, who then filed habeas corpus petitions in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia challenging their trial by commission.  We granted the saboteurs&#x92; petition for certiorari to the Court of Appeals before judgment.  See <em>id.</em>, at 19.  Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.  That course of action was warranted, we explained, &#x93;[i]n view of the public importance of the questions raised by [the cases] and of the duty which rests on the courts, in time of war as well as in time of peace, to preserve unimpaired the constitutional safeguards of civil liberty, and because in our opinion the public interest required that we consider and decide those questions without any avoidable delay.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As the Court of Appeals here recognized, <em>Quirin </em>&#x93;provides a compelling historical precedent for the power of civilian courts to entertain challenges that seek to interrupt the processes of military commissions.&#x94;  415 F. 3d, at 36.<a name="ZO-20ref" href="#ZO-20" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Finally, the Government has identified no other &#x93;important countervailing interest&#x94; that would permit federal courts to depart from their general &#x93;duty to exercise the jurisdiction that is conferred upon them by Congress.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 716 (majority opinion).  To the contrary, Hamdan and the Government both have a compelling interest in knowing in advance whether Hamdan may be tried by a military commission that arguably is without any basis in law and operates free from many of the procedural rules prescribed by Congress for courts-martial&#x97;rules intended to safeguard the accused and ensure the reliability of any conviction.  While we certainly do not foreclose the possibility that abstention may be appropriate in some cases seeking review of ongoing military commission proceedings (such as military commissions convened on the battlefield), the foregoing discussion makes clear that, under our precedent, abstention is not justified here.  We therefore proceed to consider the merits of Hamdan&#x92;s challenge.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">IV</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The military commission, a tribunal neither mentioned in the Constitution nor created by statute, was born of military necessity.  See W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 831 (rev. 2d ed. 1920) (hereinafter Winthrop).  Though foreshadowed in some respects by earlier tribunals like the Board of General Officers that General Washington convened to try British Major John Andr&#xE9; for spying during the Revolutionary War, the commission &#x93;as such&#x94; was inaugurated in 1847.  <em>Id.</em>, at 832; G. Davis, A Treatise on the Military Law of the United States 308 (2d ed. 1909) (hereinafter Davis).  As commander of occupied Mexican territory, and having available to him no other tribunal, General Winfield Scott that year ordered the establishment of both &#x93; &#x91;<em>military commissions</em>&#x92; &#x94; to try ordinary crimes committed in the occupied territory and a &#x93;<em>council of war</em>&#x94; to try offenses against the law of war.  Winthrop 832 (emphases in original).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    When the exigencies of war next gave rise to a need for use of military commissions, during the Civil War, the dual system favored by General Scott was not adopted.  Instead, a single tribunal often took jurisdiction over ordinary crimes, war crimes, and breaches of military orders alike.  As further discussed below, each aspect of that seemingly broad jurisdiction was in fact supported by a separate military exigency.  Generally, though, the need for military commissions during this period&#x97;as during the Mexican War&#x97;was driven largely by the then very limited jurisdiction of courts-martial: &#x93;The <em>occasion</em> for the military commission arises principally from the fact that the jurisdiction of the court-martial proper, in our law, is restricted by statute almost exclusively to members of the military force and to certain specific offences defined in a written code.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 831 (emphasis in original).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Exigency alone, of course, will not justify the establishment and use of penal tribunals not contemplated by Article I, &#xA7;8 and Article III, &#xA7;1 of the Constitution unless some other part of that document authorizes a response to the felt need.

Commissions historically have been used in three situations.  See Bradley &amp; Goldsmith, Congressional Authorization and the War on Terrorism, 118 Harv. L.

Their use in these circumstances has raised constitutional questions, see <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Kahanamoku,</em>

            <em>Quirin</em> is the model the Government invokes most frequently to defend the commission convened to try Hamdan.  That is both appropriate and unsurprising.  Since Guantanamo Bay is neither enemy-occupied territory nor under martial law, the law-of-war commission is the only model available.  At the same time, no more robust model of executive power exists; <em>Quirin</em> represents the high-water mark of military power to try enemy combatants for war crimes.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The classic treatise penned by Colonel William Winthrop, whom we have called &#x93;the &#x91;Blackstone of Military Law,&#x92; &#x94; <em>Reid</em> v. <em>Covert,</em>

First, &#x93;[a] military commission, (except where otherwise authorized by statute), can legally assume jurisdiction only of offenses committed within the field of the command of the convening commander.&#x94;  Winthrop 836.  The &#x93;field of command&#x94; in these circumstances means the &#x93;theatre of war.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Second, the offense charged &#x93;must have been committed within the period of the war.&#x94;<a name="ZO-28ref" href="#ZO-28" class="">

Finally, a law-of-war commission has jurisdiction to try only two kinds of offense: &#x93;Violations of the laws and usages of war cognizable by military tribunals only,&#x94; and &#x93;[b]reaches of military orders or regulations for which offenders are not legally triable by court-martial under the Articles of war.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 839.<a name="ZO-29ref" href="#ZO-29" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    All parties agree that Colonel Winthrop&#x92;s treatise accurately describes the common law governing military commissions, and that the jurisdictional limitations he identifies were incorporated in Article of War 15 and, later, Article 21 of the UCMJ.  It also is undisputed that Hamdan&#x92;s commission lacks jurisdiction to try him unless the charge &#x93;properly set[s] forth, not only the details of the act charged, but the circumstances conferring <em>jurisdiction</em>.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 842 (emphasis in original).  The question is whether the preconditions designed to ensure that a military necessity exists to justify the use of this extraordinary tribunal have been satisfied here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The charge against Hamdan, described in detail in Part I, <em>supra</em>, alleges a conspiracy extending over a number of years, from 1996 to November 2001.<a name="ZO-30ref" href="#ZO-30" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    These facts alone cast doubt on the legality of the charge and, hence, the commission; as Winthrop makes plain, the offense alleged must have been committed both in a theater of war and <em>during</em>, not before, the relevant conflict.  But the deficiencies in the time and place allegations also underscore&#x97;indeed are symptomatic of&#x97;the most serious defect of this charge: The offense it alleges is not triable by law-of-war military commission.  See <em>Yamashita</em>, 327 U.

            </a>  As we explained in <em>Quirin</em>, that is not necessarily fatal to the Government&#x92;s claim of authority to try the alleged offense by military commission; Congress, through Article 21 of the UCMJ, has &#x93;incorporated by reference&#x94; the common law of war, which may render triable by military commission certain offenses not defined by statute.  317 U.

Although the picture arguably was less clear in <em>Yamashita</em>, compare 327 U. S., at 16 (stating that the provisions of the Fourth Hague Convention of 1907,

            </a>  Winthrop explains that under the common law governing military commissions, it is not enough to intend to violate the law of war and commit overt acts in furtherance of that intention unless the overt acts either are themselves offenses against the law of war or constitute steps sufficiently substantial to qualify as an attempt.  See Winthrop 841 (&#x93;[T]he jurisdiction of the military commission should be restricted to cases of offence consisting in <em>overt acts</em>, <em>i.e.</em>, in unlawful commissions or actual attempts to commit, and not in intentions merely&#x94; (emphasis in original)).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government cites three sources that it says show otherwise.  First, it points out that the Nazi saboteurs in <em>Quirin</em> were charged with conspiracy.  See Brief for Respondents 27.  Second, it observes that Winthrop at one point in his treatise identifies conspiracy as an offense &#x93;prosecuted by military commissions.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing Winthrop 839, and n. 5).  Finally, it notes that another military historian, Charles Roscoe Howland, lists conspiracy &#x93; &#x91;to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the enemy&#x92; &#x94; as an offense that was tried as a violation of the law of war during the Civil War.  Brief for Respondents 27&#x96;28 (citing C. Howland, Digest of Opinions of the Judge Advocates General of the Army 1071 (1912) (hereinafter Howland)).  On close analysis, however, these sources at best lend little support to the Government&#x92;s position and at worst undermine it.  By any measure, they fail to satisfy the high standard of clarity required to justify the use of a military commission.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    That the defendants in <em>Quirin</em> were charged with conspiracy is not persuasive, since the Court declined to address whether the offense actually qualified as a violation of the law of war&#x97;let alone one triable by military commission.  The <em>Quirin</em> defendants were charged with the following offenses:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;[I.]Violation of the law of war.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

&#x93;[II.]Violation of Article 81 of the Articles of War, defining the offense of relieving or attempting to relieve, or corresponding with or giving intelligence to, the enemy.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

&#x93;[III.]Violation of Article 82, defining the offense of spying.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

&#x93;[IV.]Conspiracy to commit the offenses alleged in charges [I, II, and III].&#x94;  317 U. S., at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The Government, defending its charge, argued that the conspiracy alleged &#x93;constitute[d] an additional violation of the law of war.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 15.  The saboteurs disagreed; they maintained that &#x93;[t]he charge of conspiracy can not stand if the other charges fall.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 8.  The Court, however, declined to resolve the dispute.  It concluded, first, that the specification supporting Charge I adequately alleged a &#x93;violation of the law of war&#x94; that was not &#x93;merely colorable or without foundation.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 36.  The facts the Court deemed sufficient for this purpose were that the defendants, admitted enemy combatants, entered upon U. S. territory in time of war without uniform &#x93;for the purpose of destroying property used or useful in prosecuting the war.&#x94;  That act was &#x93;a hostile and warlike&#x94; one.  <em>Id.</em>, at 36, 37.  The Court was careful in its decision to identify an overt, &#x93;complete&#x94; act.  Responding to the argument that the saboteurs had &#x93;not actually committed or attempted to commit any act of depredation or entered the theatre or zone of active military operations&#x94; and therefore had not violated the law of war, the Court responded that they had actually &#x93;passed our military and naval lines and defenses or went behind those lines, in civilian dress and with hostile purpose.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 38.  &#x93;The offense was complete when with that purpose they entered&#x97;or, having so entered, they remained upon&#x97;our territory in time of war without uniform or other appropriate means of identification.&#x94;  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Turning to the other charges alleged, the Court explained that &#x93;[s]ince the first specification of Charge I sets forth a violation of the law of war, we have no occasion to pass on the adequacy of the second specification of Charge I, or to construe the 81st and 82nd Articles of War for the purpose of ascertaining whether the specifications under Charges II and III allege violations of those Articles or whether if so construed they are constitutional.&#x94;  Id., at 46.  No mention was made at all of Charge IV&#x97;the conspiracy charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    If anything, <em>Quirin</em> supports Hamdan&#x92;s argument that conspiracy is not a violation of the law of war.  Not only did the Court pointedly omit any discussion of the conspiracy charge, but its analysis of Charge I placed special emphasis on the <em>completion</em> of an offense; it took seriously the saboteurs&#x92; argument that there can be no violation of a law of war&#x97;at least not one triable by military commission&#x97;without the actual commission of or attempt to commit a &#x93;hostile and warlike act.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 37&#x96;38.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    That limitation makes eminent sense when one considers the necessity from whence this kind of military commission grew: The need to dispense swift justice, often in the form of execution, to illegal belligerents captured on the battlefield.  See S. Rep. No. 130, 64th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 40 (1916) (testimony of Brig. Gen. Enoch H. Crowder) (observing that Article of War 15 preserves the power of &#x93;the military commander <em>in the field in time of war</em>&#x94; to use military commissions (emphasis added)).  The same urgency would not have been felt vis-&amp;Agrave;-vis enemies who had done little more than agree to violate the laws of war.  Cf. 
31Op. Atty. Gen.
356,
357,
361 (1918) (opining that a German spy could not be tried by military commission because, having been apprehended before entering &#x93;any camp, fortification or other military premises of the United States,&#x94; he had &#x93;committed [his offenses] outside of the field of military operations&#x94;).  The <em>Quirin</em> Court acknowledged as much when it described the President&#x92;s authority to use law-of-war military commissions as the power to &#x93;seize and subject to disciplinary measures those enemies <em>who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort</em> have violated the law of war.&#x94;  317 U. S., at 28&#x96;29 (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Winthrop and Howland are only superficially more helpful to the Government.  Howland, granted, lists &#x93;conspiracy by two or more to violate the laws of war by destroying life or property in aid of the enemy&#x94; as one of over 20 &#x93;offenses against the laws and usages of war&#x94; &#x93;passed upon and punished by military commissions.&#x94;  Howland 1071.  But while the records of cases that Howland cites following his list of offenses against the law of war support inclusion of the other offenses mentioned, they provide no support for the inclusion of conspiracy as a violation of the law of war.  See <em>ibid.</em> (citing Record Books of the Judge Advocate General Office, R. 2, 144; R. 3, 401, 589, 649; R. 4, 320; R. 5, 36, 590; R. 6, 20; R. 7, 413; R. 8, 529; R. 9, 149, 202, 225, 481, 524, 535; R. 10, 567; R. 11, 473, 513; R. 13, 125, 675; R. 16, 446; R. 21, 101, 280).  Winthrop, apparently recognizing as much, excludes conspiracy of any kind from his own list of offenses against the law of war.  See Winthrop 839&#x96;840.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Winthrop does, unsurprisingly, include &#x93;criminal conspiracies&#x94; in his list of &#x93;[c]rimes and statutory offenses cognizable by State or U. S. courts&#x94; and triable by martial law or military government commission.  See <em>id.</em>, at 839.  And, in a footnote, he cites several Civil War examples of &#x93;conspiracies of this class, <em>or of the first and second classes combined</em>.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 839, n. 5 (emphasis added).  The Government relies on this footnote for its contention that conspiracy was triable both as an ordinary crime (a crime of the &#x93;first class&#x94;) and, independently, as a war crime (a crime of the &#x93;second class&#x94;).  But the footnote will not support the weight the Government places on it.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    As we have seen, the military commissions convened during the Civil War functioned at once as martial law or military government tribunals and as law-of-war commissions.  See n. 27, <em>supra</em>.  Accordingly, they regularly tried war crimes and ordinary crimes together.  Indeed, as Howland observes, &#x93;[n]ot infrequently the crime, as charged and found, was a combination of the two species of offenses.&#x94;  Howland 1071; see also Davis 310, n. 2; Winthrop 842.  The example he gives is &#x93; &#x91;murder in violation of the laws of war.&#x92; &#x94;  Howland 1071&#x96;1072.  Winthrop&#x92;s conspiracy &#x93;of the first and second classes combined&#x94; is, like Howland&#x92;s example, best understood as a species of compound offense of the type tried by the hybrid military commissions of the Civil War.  It is not a stand-alone offense against the law of war.  Winthrop confirms this understanding later in his discussion, when he emphasizes that &#x93;<em>overt acts</em>&#x94; constituting war crimes are the only proper subject at least of those military tribunals not convened to stand in for local courts.  Winthrop 841, and nn. 22, 23 (emphasis in original) (citing W. Finlason, Martial Law 130 (1867)).</p>

Winder, <em>while the evidence at the trial of Wirz was deemed by the court to implicate him in the conspiracy</em> against the lives of all Federal prisoners in rebel hands, <em>no such specific overt acts of violation of the laws of war</em> are as yet fixed upon him as to make it expedient to prefer formal charges and bring him to trial.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 783 (emphases added).<a name="ZO-37ref" href="#ZO-37" class="">

            </a>  As observed above, see <em>supra</em>, at 40, none of the major treaties governing the law of war identifies conspiracy as a violation thereof.  And the only &#x93;conspiracy&#x94; crimes that have been recognized by international war crimes tribunals (whose jurisdiction often extends beyond war crimes proper to crimes against humanity and crimes against the peace) are conspiracy to commit genocide and common plan to wage aggressive war, which is a crime against the peace and requires for its commission actual participation in a &#x93;concrete plan to wage war.&#x94;  1 Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal: Nuremberg, 14 November 1945&#x96;1 October 1946, p. 225 (1947).  The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg, over the prosecution&#x92;s objections, pointedly refused to recognize as a violation of the law of war conspiracy to commit war crimes, see, <em>e.g.</em>, 22 <em>id.</em>, at 469,<a name="ZO-39ref" href="#ZO-39" class="">

As one prominent figure from the Nuremberg trials has explained, members of the Tribunal objected to recognition of conspiracy as a violation of the law of war on the ground that &#x93;[t]he Anglo-American concept of conspiracy was not part of European legal systems and arguably not an element of the internationally recognized laws of war.&#x94;  T.

        <p class="bodytext">    In sum, the sources that the Government and <span class="smallcaps">Justice Thomas</span> rely upon to show that conspiracy to violate the law of war is itself a violation of the law of war in fact demonstrate quite the opposite.  Far from making the requisite substantial showing, the Government has failed even to offer a &#x93;merely colorable&#x94; case for inclusion of conspiracy among those offenses cognizable by law-of-war military commission.  Cf. <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 36.  Because the charge does not support the commission&#x92;s jurisdiction, the commission lacks authority to try Hamdan.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The charge&#x92;s shortcomings are not merely formal, but are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition&#x97;at least in the absence of specific congressional authorization&#x97;for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.  Hamdan&#x92;s tribunal was appointed not by a military commander in the field of battle, but by a retired major general stationed away from any active hostilities.  Cf. <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush, </em>542 U. S., at 487 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy, J.</span>, concurring in judgment) (observing that &#x93;Guantanamo Bay is &#x2026; far removed from any hostilities&#x94;).  Hamdan is charged not with an overt act for which he was caught redhanded in a theater of war and which military efficiency demands be tried expeditiously, but with an <em>agreement</em> the inception of which long predated the attacks of September 11, 2001 and the AUMF.  That may well be a crime,<a name="ZO-41ref" href="#ZO-41" class="">

            </a> but it is not an offense that &#x93;by the law of war may be tried by military commissio[n].&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/821.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;821</a>.  None of the overt acts alleged to have been committed in furtherance of the agreement is itself a war crime, or even necessarily occurred during time of, or in a theater of, war.  Any urgent need for imposition or execution of judgment is utterly belied by the record; Hamdan was arrested in November 2001 and he was not charged until mid-2004.  These simply are not the circumstances in which, by any stretch of the historical evidence or this Court&#x92;s precedents, a military commission established by Executive Order under the authority of Article 21 of the UCMJ may lawfully try a person and subject him to punishment.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">VI</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Whether or not the Government has charged Hamdan with an offense against the law of war cognizable by military commission, the commission lacks power to proceed.  The UCMJ conditions the President&#x92;s use of military commissions on compliance not only with the American common law of war, but also with the rest of the UCMJ itself, insofar as applicable, and with the &#x93;rules and precepts of the law of nations,&#x94; <em>Quirin</em>, 317 U. S., at 28&#x97;including, <em>inter alia</em>, the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.  See <em>Yamashita</em>, 327 U. S., at 20&#x96;21, 23&#x96;24.  The procedures that the Government has decreed will govern Hamdan&#x92;s trial by commission violate these laws.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The commission&#x92;s procedures are set forth in Commission Order No. 1, which was amended most recently on </p>
        <p class="bodytext">August 31, 2005&#x97;after Hamdan&#x92;s trial had already begun.  Every commission established pursuant to Commission Order No. 1 must have a presiding officer and at least three other members, all of whom must be commissioned officers.  &#xA7;4(A)(1).  The presiding officer&#x92;s job is to rule on questions of law and other evidentiary and interlocutory issues; the other members make findings and, if applicable, sentencing decisions.  &#xA7;4(A)(5).  The accused is entitled to appointed military counsel and may hire civilian counsel at his own expense so long as such counsel is a U. S. citizen with security clearance &#x93;at the level SECRET or higher.&#x94;  &#xA7;&#xA7;4(C)(2)&#x96;(3).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The accused also is entitled to a copy of the charge(s) against him, both in English and his own language (if different), to a presumption of innocence, and to certain other rights typically afforded criminal defendants in civilian courts and courts-martial.  See &#xA7;&#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P).  These rights are subject, however, to one glaring condition: The accused and his civilian counsel may be excluded from, and precluded from ever learning what evidence was presented during, any part of the proceeding that either the Appointing Authority or the presiding officer decides to &#x93;close.&#x94;  Grounds for such closure &#x93;include the protection of information classified or classifiable &#x2026; ; information protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure; the physical safety of participants in Commission proceedings, including prospective witnesses; intelligence and law enforcement sources, methods, or activities; and other national security interests.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(B)(3).<a name="ZO-42ref" href="#ZO-42" class="">
                <sup>

                </sup>
            </a>  Appointed military defense counsel must be privy to these closed sessions, but may, at the presiding officer&#x92;s discretion, be forbidden to reveal to his or her client what took place therein.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">Another striking feature of the rules governing Hamdan&#x92;s commission is that they permit the admission of any evidence that, in the opinion of the presiding officer, &#x93;would have probative value to a reasonable person.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(D)(1).  Under this test, not only is testimonial hearsay and evidence obtained through coercion fully admissible, but neither live testimony nor witnesses&#x92; written statements need be sworn.  See &#xA7;&#xA7;6(D)(2)(b), (3).  Moreover, the accused and his civilian counsel may be denied access to evidence in the form of &#x93;protected information&#x94; (which includes classified information as well as &#x93;information protected by law or rule from unauthorized disclosure&#x94; and &#x93;information concerning other national security interests,&#x94; &#xA7;&#xA7;6(B)(3), 6(D)(5)(a)(v)), so long as the presiding officer concludes that the evidence is &#x93;probative&#x94; under &#xA7;6(D)(1) and that its admission without the accused&#x92;s knowledge would not &#x93;result in the denial of a full and fair trial.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(D)(5)(b).<a name="ZO-43ref" href="#ZO-43" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>43</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  Finally, a presiding officer&#x92;s determination that evidence &#x93;would not have probative value to a reasonable person&#x94; may be overridden by a majority of the other commission members.  &#xA7;6(D)(1).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Once all the evidence is in, the commission members (not including the presiding officer) must vote on the accused&#x92;s guilt.  A two-thirds vote will suffice for both a verdict of guilty and for imposition of any sentence not including death (the imposition of which requires a unanimous vote).  &#xA7;6(F).  Any appeal is taken to a three-member review panel composed of military officers and designated by the Secretary of Defense, only one member of which need have experience as a judge.  &#xA7;6(H)(4).  The review panel is directed to &#x93;disregard any variance from procedures specified in this Order or elsewhere that would not materially have affected the outcome of the trial before the Commission.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Once the panel makes its recommendation to the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary can either remand for further proceedings or forward the record to the President with his recommendation as to final disposition.  &#xA7;6(H)(5).  The President then, unless he has delegated the task to the Secretary, makes the &#x93;final decision.&#x94;  &#xA7;6(H)(6).  He may change the commission&#x92;s findings or sentence only in a manner favorable to the accused.  Ibid.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">B</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan raises both general and particular objections to the procedures set forth in Commission Order No. 1.  His general objection is that the procedures&#x92; admitted deviation from those governing courts-martial itself renders the commission illegal.  Chief among his particular objections are that he may, under the Commission Order, be convicted based on evidence he has not seen or heard, and that any evidence admitted against him need not comply with the admissibility or relevance rules typically applicable in criminal trials and court-martial proceedings.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government objects to our consideration of any procedural challenge at this stage on the grounds that (1) the abstention doctrine espoused in <em>Councilman</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a>, precludes pre-enforcement review of procedural rules, (2) Hamdan will be able to raise any such challenge following a &#x93;final decision&#x94; under the DTA, and (3) &#x93;there is &#x2026; no basis to presume, before the trial has even commenced, that the trial will not be conducted in good faith and according to law.&#x94;  Brief for Respondents 45&#x96;46, nn. 20&#x96;21.  The first of these contentions was disposed of in Part III, <em>supra</em>, and neither of the latter two is sound.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, because Hamdan apparently is not subject to the death penalty (at least as matters now stand) and may receive a sentence shorter than 10 years&#x92; imprisonment, he has no automatic right to review of the commission&#x92;s &#x93;final decision&#x94;<a name="ZO-44ref" href="#ZO-44" class="">

2743.  Second, contrary to the Government&#x92;s assertion, there <em>is</em> a &#x93;basis to presume&#x94; that the procedures employed during Hamdan&#x92;s trial will violate the law: The procedures are described with particularity in Commission Order No. 1, and implementation of some of them has already occurred.  One of Hamdan&#x92;s complaints is that he will be, and <em>indeed already has been</em>, excluded from his own trial.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 12; App. to Pet. for Cert. 45a.  Under these circumstances, review of the procedures in advance of a &#x93;final decision&#x94;&#x97;the timing of which is left entirely to the discretion of the President under the DTA&#x97;is appropriate.  We turn, then, to consider the merits of Hamdan&#x92;s procedural challenge.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In part because the difference between military commissions and courts-martial originally was a difference of jurisdiction alone, and in part to protect against abuse and ensure evenhandedness under the pressures of war, the procedures governing trials by military commission historically have been the same as those governing courts-martial.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 1 The War of the Rebellion 248 (2d series 1894) (General Order 1 issued during the Civil War required military commissions to &#x93;be constituted in a similar manner and their proceedings be conducted according to the same general rules as courts-martial in order to prevent abuses which might otherwise arise&#x94;).  Accounts of commentators from Winthrop through General Crowder&#x97;who drafted Article of War 15 and whose views have been deemed &#x93;authoritative&#x94; by this Court, <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 353&#x97;confirm as much.<a name="ZO-45ref" href="#ZO-45" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>45</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  As recently as the Korean and Vietnam wars, during which use of military commissions was contemplated but never made, the principle of procedural parity was espoused as a background assumption.  See Paust, Antiterrorism Military Commissions: Courting Illegality, 23 Mich. J. Int&#x92;l L. 1, 3&#x96;5 (2001&#x96;2002).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    There is a glaring historical exception to this general rule.  The procedures and evidentiary rules used to try General Yamashita near the end of World War II deviated in significant respects from those then governing courts-martial.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/1" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 1</a>.  The force of that precedent, however, has been seriously undermined by post-World War II developments.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Yamashita, from late 1944 until September 1945, was Commanding General of the Fourteenth Army Group of the Imperial Japanese Army, which had exercised control over the Philippine Islands.  On September 3, 1945, after American forces regained control of the Philippines, Yamashita surrendered.  Three weeks later, he was charged with violations of the law of war.  A few weeks after that, he was arraigned before a military commission convened in the Philippines.  He pleaded not guilty, and his trial lasted for two months.  On December 7, 1945, Yamashita was convicted and sentenced to hang.  See <em>id.</em>, at 5; <em>id.</em>, at 31&#x96;34 (Murphy, J., dissenting).  This Court upheld the denial of his petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The procedures and rules of evidence employed during Yamashita&#x92;s trial departed so far from those used in courts-martial that they generated an unusually long and vociferous critique from two Members of this Court.  See <em>id.</em>, at 41&#x96;81 (Rutledge, J., joined by Murphy, J., dissenting).<a name="ZO-46ref" href="#ZO-46" class="">
                <sup>

                </sup>
            </a>  Among the dissenters&#x92; primary concerns was that the commission had free rein to consider all evidence &#x93;which in the commission&#x92;s opinion &#x91;would be of assistance in proving or disproving the charge,&#x92; without any of the usual modes of authentication.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 49 (Rutledge, J.).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The majority, however, did not pass on the merits of Yamashita&#x92;s procedural challenges because it concluded that his status disentitled him to any protection under the Articles of War (specifically, those set forth in Article 38, which would become Article 36 of the UCMJ) or the Geneva Convention of 1929, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">47</a>Stat.
2021 (1929 Geneva Convention).  The Court explained that Yamashita was neither a &#x93;person made subject to the Articles of War by Article 2&#x94; thereof, 327 U. S., at 20, nor a protected prisoner of war being tried for crimes committed during his detention, <em>id.</em>, at 21.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    At least partially in response to subsequent criticism of General Yamashita&#x92;s trial, the UCMJ&#x92;s codification of the Articles of War after World War II expanded the category of persons subject thereto to include defendants in Yamashita&#x92;s (and Hamdan&#x92;s) position,<a name="ZO-47ref" href="#ZO-47" class="">

            </a> and the Third Geneva Convention of 1949 extended prisoner-of-war protections to individuals tried for crimes committed before their capture.  See 3 Int&#x92;l Comm. of Red Cross,<a name="ZO-48ref" href="#ZO-48" class="">

            </a> Commentary: Geneva Convention Relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War 413 (1960) (hereinafter GCIII Commentary) (explaining that Article 85, which extends the Convention&#x92;s protections to &#x93;[p]risoners of war prosecuted under the laws of the Detaining Power for acts committed prior to capture,&#x94; was adopted in response to judicial interpretations of the 1929 Convention, including this Court&#x92;s decision in <em>Yamashita</em>).  The most notorious exception to the principle of uniformity, then, has been stripped of its precedential value.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The uniformity principle is not an inflexible one; it does not preclude all departures from the procedures dictated for use by courts-martial.  But any departure must be tailored to the exigency that necessitates it.  See Winthrop 835, n. 81.  That understanding is reflected in Article 36 of the UCMJ, which provides:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(a)The procedure, including modes of proof, in cases before courts-martial, courts of inquiry, military commissions, and other military tribunals may be prescribed by the President by regulations which shall, so far as he considers practicable, apply the principles of law and the rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts, but which may not be contrary to or inconsistent with this chapter.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    &#x93;(b)All rules and regulations made under this article shall be uniform insofar as practicable and shall be reported to Congress.&#x94;  70A Stat. 50.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Article 36 places two restrictions on the President&#x92;s power to promulgate rules of procedure for courts-martial and military commissions alike.  First, no procedural rule he adopts may be &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; the UCMJ&#x97;however practical it may seem.  Second, the rules adopted must be &#x93;uniform insofar as practicable.&#x94;  That is, the rules applied to military commissions must be the same as those applied to courts-martial unless such uniformity proves impracticable.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan argues that Commission Order No. 1 violates both of these restrictions; he maintains that the procedures described in the Commission Order are inconsistent with the UCMJ and that the Government has offered no explanation for their deviation from the procedures governing courts-martial, which are set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States (2005 ed.) (Manual for Courts-Martial).  Among the inconsistencies Hamdan identifies is that between &#xA7;6 of the Commission Order, which permits exclusion of the accused from proceedings and denial of his access to evidence in certain circumstances, and the UCMJ&#x92;s requirement that &#x93;[a]ll &#x2026; proceedings&#x94; other than votes and deliberations by courts-martial &#x93;shall be made a part of the record and shall be in the presence of the accused.&#x94;  10  U. S. C. A. &#xA7;839(c) (Supp. 2006).  Hamdan also observes that the Commission Order dispenses with virtually all evidentiary rules applicable in courts-martial.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government has three responses.  First, it argues, only 9 of the UCMJ&#x92;s 158 Articles&#x97;the ones that expressly mention &#x93;military commissions&#x94;<a name="ZO-49ref" href="#ZO-49" class="">
                <sup>

                </sup>
            </a>&#x97;actually apply to commissions, and Commission Order No. 1 sets forth no procedure that is &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; those 9 provisions.  Second, the Government contends, military commissions would be of no use if the President were hamstrung by those provisions of the UCMJ that govern courts-martial.  Finally, the President&#x92;s determination that &#x93;the danger to the safety of the United States and the nature of international terrorism&#x94; renders it impracticable &#x93;to apply in military commissions &#x2026; the principles of law and rules of evidence generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States district courts,&#x94; November 13 Order &#xA7;1(f), is, in the Government&#x92;s view, explanation enough for any deviation from court-martial procedures.  See Brief for Respondents 43&#x96;47, and n. 22.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Hamdan has the better of this argument.  Without reaching the question whether any provision of Commission Order No. 1 is strictly &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; other provisions of the UCMJ, we conclude that the &#x93;practicability&#x94; determination the President has made is insufficient to justify variances from the procedures governing courts-martial.  Subsection (b) of Article 36 was added after World War II, and requires a different showing of impracticability from the one required by subsection (a).  Subsection (a) requires that the rules the President promulgates for courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions alike conform to those that govern procedures in <em>Article III courts</em>, &#x93;so far as <em>he considers</em> practicable.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/836.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;836(a)</a> (emphasis added).  Subsection (b), by contrast, demands that the rules applied in courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions&#x97;whether or not they conform with the Federal Rules of Evidence&#x97;be &#x93;uniform <em>insofar as practicable</em>.&#x94;  &#xA7;836(b) (emphasis added).  Under the latter provision, then, the rules set forth in the Manual for Courts-Martial must apply to military commissions unless impracticable.<a name="ZO-50ref" href="#ZO-50" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Nothing in the record before us demonstrates that it would be impracticable to apply court-martial rules in this case.  There is no suggestion, for example, of any logistical difficulty in securing properly sworn and authenticated evidence or in applying the usual principles of relevance and admissibility.  Assuming <em>arguendo</em> that the reasons articulated in the President&#x92;s Article 36(a) determination ought to be considered in evaluating the impracticability of applying court-martial rules, the only reason offered in support of that determination is the danger posed by international terrorism.<a name="ZO-52ref" href="#ZO-52" class="">

            </a>  Without for one moment underestimating that danger, it is not evident to us why it should require, in the case of Hamdan&#x92;s trial, any variance from the rules that govern courts-martial.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The absence of any showing of impracticability is particularly disturbing when considered in light of the clear and admitted failure to apply one of the most fundamental protections afforded not just by the Manual for Courts-Martial but also by the UCMJ itself: the right to be present.  See 10  U. S. C. A. &#xA7;839(c) (Supp. 2006).  Whether or not that departure technically is &#x93;contrary to or inconsistent with&#x94; the terms of the UCMJ, 10  U. S. C. &#xA7;836(a), the jettisoning of so basic a right cannot lightly be excused as &#x93;practicable.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Under the circumstances, then, the rules applicable in courts-martial must apply.  Since it is undisputed that Commission Order No. 1 deviates in many significant respects from those rules, it necessarily violates Article 36(b).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Government&#x92;s objection that requiring compliance with the court-martial rules imposes an undue burden both ignores the plain meaning of Article 36(b) and misunderstands the purpose and the history of military commissions.  The military commission was not born of a desire to dispense a more summary form of justice than is afforded by courts-martial; it developed, rather, as a tribunal of necessity to be employed when courts-martial lacked jurisdiction over either the accused or the subject matter.  See Winthrop 831.  Exigency lent the commission its legitimacy, but did not further justify the wholesale jettisoning of procedural protections.  That history explains why the military commission&#x92;s procedures typically have been the ones used by courts-martial.  That the jurisdiction of the two tribunals today may sometimes overlap, see <em>Madsen</em>, 343 U. S., at 354, does not detract from the force of this history;<a name="ZO-53ref" href="#ZO-53" class="">

Article 36, confirming as much, strikes a careful balance between uniform procedure and the need to accommodate exigencies that may sometimes arise in a theater of war.

, to hold that Hamdan could not invoke the Geneva Conventions to challenge the Government&#x92;s plan to prosecute him in accordance with Commission Order No. 1.  <em>Eisentrager</em> involved a challenge by 21 German nationals to their 1945 convictions for war crimes by a military tribunal convened in Nanking, China, and to their subsequent imprisonment in occupied Germany.  The petitioners argued, <em>inter alia</em>, that the 1929 Geneva Convention rendered illegal some of the procedures employed during their trials, which they said deviated impermissibly from the procedures used by courts-martial to try American soldiers.  See <em>id.</em>, at 789.  We rejected that claim on the merits because the petitioners (unlike Hamdan here) had failed to identify any prejudicial disparity &#x93;between the Commission that tried [them] and those that would try an offending soldier of the American forces of like rank,&#x94; and in any event could claim no protection, under the 1929 Convention, during trials for crimes that occurred before their confinement as prisoners of war.  <em>Id.</em>, at 790.<a name="ZO-56ref" href="#ZO-56" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Buried in a footnote of the opinion, however, is this curious statement suggesting that the Court lacked power even to consider the merits of the Geneva Convention argument:</p>

It is, however, the obvious scheme of the Agreement that responsibility for observance and enforcement of these rights is upon political and military authorities.  Rights of alien enemies are vindicated under it only through protests and intervention of protecting powers as the rights of our citizens against foreign governments are vindicated only by Presidential intervention.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 789, n. 14.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">

, they are, as the Government does not dispute, part of the law of war.  See <em>Hamdi, </em>542 U. S., at 520&#x96;521 (plurality opinion).  And compliance with the law of war is the condition upon which the authority set forth in Article 21 is granted.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">ii</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    For the Court of Appeals, acknowledgment of that condition was no bar to Hamdan&#x92;s trial by commission.  As an alternative to its holding that Hamdan could not invoke the Geneva Conventions at all, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Conventions did not in any event apply to the armed conflict during which Hamdan was captured.  The court accepted the Executive&#x92;s assertions that Hamdan was captured in connection with the United States&#x92; war with al Qaeda and that that war is distinct from the war with the Taliban in Afghanistan.  It further reasoned that the war with al Qaeda evades the reach of the Geneva Conventions.  See 415 F. 3d, at 41&#x96;42. We, like Judge Williams, disagree with the latter conclusion.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The conflict with al Qaeda is not, according to the Government, a conflict to which the full protections afforded detainees under the 1949 Geneva Conventions apply because Article 2 of those Conventions (which appears in all four Conventions) renders the full protections applicable only to &#x93;all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties.&#x94;  6 U.

            </a>  Since Hamdan was captured and detained incident to the conflict with al Qaeda and not the conflict with the Taliban, and since al Qaeda, unlike Afghanistan, is not a &#x93;High Contracting Party&#x94;&#x97;<em>i.e.</em>, a signatory of the Conventions, the protections of those Conventions are not, it is argued, applicable to Hamdan.<a name="ZO-60ref" href="#ZO-60" class="">

One such provision prohibits &#x93;the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>. </p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court of Appeals thought, and the Government asserts, that Common Article 3 does not apply to Hamdan because the conflict with al Qaeda, being &#x93; &#x91;international in scope,&#x92; &#x94; does not qualify as a &#x93; &#x91;conflict not of an international character.&#x92; &#x94;  415 F. 3d, at 41.  That reasoning is erroneous.  The term &#x93;conflict not of an international character&#x94; is used here in contradistinction to a conflict between nations.  So much is demonstrated by the &#x93;fundamental logic [of] the Convention&#x92;s provisions on its application.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 44 (Williams, J., concurring).  Common Article 2 provides that &#x93;the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties.&#x94;  6 U. S. T., at 3318 (Art. 2, &#xB6;1).  High Contracting Parties (signatories) also must abide by all terms of the Conventions vis-&amp;Agrave;-vis one another even if one party to the conflict is a nonsignatory &#x93;Power,&#x94; and must so abide vis-&amp;Agrave;-vis the nonsignatory if &#x93;the latter accepts and applies&#x94; those terms.  <em>Ibid.</em> (Art. 2, &#xB6;3).  Common Article 3, by contrast, affords some minimal protection, falling short of full protection under the Conventions, to individuals associated with neither a signatory nor even a nonsignatory &#x93;Power&#x94; who are involved in a conflict &#x93;in the territory of&#x94; a signatory.  The latter kind of conflict is distinguishable from the conflict described in Common Article 2 chiefly because it does not involve a clash between nations (whether signatories or not).  In context, then, the phrase &#x93;not of an international character&#x94; bears its literal meaning.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, J. Bentham, Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation 6, 296 (J. Burns &amp; H. Hart eds. 1970) (using the term &#x93;international law&#x94; as a &#x93;new though not inexpressive appellation&#x94; meaning &#x93;betwixt nation and nation&#x94;; defining &#x93;international&#x94; to include &#x93;mutual transactions between sovereigns as such&#x94;); Commentary on the Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, p. 1351 (1987) (&#x93;[A] non-international armed conflict is distinct from an international armed conflict because of the legal status of the entities opposing each other&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Although the official commentaries accompanying Common Article 3 indicate that an important purpose of the provision was to furnish minimal protection to rebels involved in one kind of &#x93;conflict not of an international character,&#x94; <em>i.e.</em>, a civil war, see GCIII Commentary 36&#x96;37, the commentaries also make clear &#x93;that the scope of the Article must be as wide as possible,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 36.<a name="ZO-63ref" href="#ZO-63" class="">

            </a>  In fact, limiting language that would have rendered Common Article 3 applicable &#x93;especially [to] cases of civil war, colonial conflicts, or wars of religion,&#x94; was omitted from the final version of the Article, which coupled broader scope of application with a narrower range of rights than did earlier proposed iterations.

        <p class="opcentered">iii</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Common Article 3, then, is applicable here and, as indicated above, requires that Hamdan be tried by a &#x93;regularly constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.&#x94;  6 U.

Indeed, Bruner itself relied on such other indications&#x96;including a negative inference drawn from the statutory text, cf. infra, at 13&#x96;to support its conclusion that jurisdiction was not available.   The Court observed that (1) Congress had been put on notice by prior lower court cases addressing the Tucker Act that it ought to specifically reserve jurisdiction over pending cases, see 343 U. S., at 115, and (2) in contrast to the congressional silence concerning reservation of jurisdiction, reservation had been made of &#x93; &#x91;any rights or liabilities&#x92; existing at the effective date of the Act&#x94; repealed by another provision of the Act, ibid., n. 7.

Congress deemed that provision insufficient, standing alone, to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable to pending cases; hence its adoption of subsection (h)(2).  Justice Scalia seeks to avoid reducing subsection (h)(2) to a mere redundancy&#x97;a consequence he seems to acknowledge must otherwise follow from his interpretation&#x97;by speculating that Congress had special reasons, not also relevant to subsection (e)(1), to worry that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) would be ruled inapplicable to pending cases.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-10" href="#ZO-10ref">10</a> We note that statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to what the text of the DTA and its drafting history already make plain.  Senator Levin, one of the sponsors of the final bill, objected to earlier versions of the Act&#x92;s &#x93;effective date&#x94; provision that would have made subsection (e)(1) applicable to pending cases.  See, e.g., 151 Cong. Rec. S12667 (Nov. 10, 2005) (amendment proposed by Sen. Graham that would have rendered what is now subsection (e)(1) applicable to &#x93;any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act&#x94;).  Senator Levin urged adoption of an alternative amendment that &#x93;would apply only to new habeas cases filed after the date of enactment.&#x94;  Id., at S12802 (Nov. 15, 2005).  That alternative amendment became the text of subsection (h)(2).  (In light of the extensive discussion of the DTA&#x92;s effect on pending cases prior to passage of the Act, see, e.g., id., at S12664 (Nov. 10, 2005); id., at S12755 (Nov. 14, 2005); id., at S12799&#x96;S12802 (Nov. 15, 2005); id., at S14245, S14252&#x96;S14253, S14257&#x96;S14258, S14274&#x96;S14275 (Dec. 21, 2005), it cannot be said that the changes to subsection (h)(2) were inconsequential.  Cf. post, at 14 (Scalia, J., dissenting).)


While statements attributed to the final bill&#x92;s two other sponsors, Senators Graham and Kyl, arguably contradict Senator Levin&#x92;s contention that the final version of the Act preserved jurisdiction over pending habeas cases, see 151 Cong. Rec. S14263&#x96;S14264 (Dec. 21, 2005), those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record after the Senate debate.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 5, n. 6; see also 151 Cong. Rec. S14260 (statement of Sen. Kyl) (&#x93;I would like to say a few words about the now-completed National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2006&#x94; (emphasis added)).  All statements made during the debate itself support Senator Levin&#x92;s understanding that the final text of the DTA would not render subsection (e)(1) applicable to pending cases.  See, e.g., id., at S14245, S14252&#x96;S14253, S14274&#x96;S14275 (Dec. 21, 2005).  The statements that Justice Scalia cites as evidence to the contrary construe subsection (e)(3) to strip this Court of jurisdiction, see post, at 12, n. 4 (dissenting opinion) (quoting 151 Cong. Rec.

Rec. S12756 (Nov. 14, 2005)), follows directly after the uncontradicted statement of his co-sponsor, Senator Levin, assuring members of the Senate that &#x93;the amendment will not strip the courts of jurisdiction over [pending] cases.&#x94;  Id., at S12755.

S. T. 3316, 3318.  See Part VI, infra.  Although the Court of Appeals rejected the Article 3 argument on the merits, it also stated that, because the challenge was not &#x93;jurisdictional,&#x94; it did not fall within the exception that Schlesinger v. Councilman, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a> (1975)
, recognized for defendants who raise substantial arguments that a military tribunal lacks personal jurisdiction over them.  See 415 F. 3d, at 42.


In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals conflated two distinct inquiries: (1) whether Hamdan has raised a substantial argument that the military commission lacks authority to try him; and, more fundamentally, (2) whether the comity considerations underlying Councilman apply to trigger the abstention principle in the first place.  As the Court of Appeals acknowledged at the beginning of its opinion, the first question warrants consideration only if the answer to the second is yes.  See 415 F. 3d, at 36&#x96;37.  Since, as the Court of Appeals properly concluded, the answer to the second question is in fact no, there is no need to consider any exception.


At any rate, it appears that the exception would apply here.  As discussed in Part VI, infra, Hamdan raises a substantial argument that, because the military commission that has been convened to try him is not a &#x93; &#x91;regularly constituted court&#x92; &#x94; under the Geneva Conventions, it is ultra vires and thus lacks jurisdiction over him.

&#x93;If, in foreign invasion or civil war, the courts are actually closed, and it is impossible to administer criminal justice according to law, then, on the theatre of active military operations, where war really prevails, there is a necessity to furnish a substitute for the civil authority, thus overthrown, to preserve the safety of the army and society; and as no power is left but the military, it is allowed to govern by martial rule until the laws can have their free course.  As necessity creates the rule, so it limits its duration; for, if this government is continued after the courts are reinstated, it is a gross usurpation of power.  Martial rule can never exist where the courts are open, and in the proper and unobstructed exercise of their jurisdiction.  It is also confined to the locality of actual war.&#x94;  4 Wall., at 127 (emphases in original).

Hence, &#x93;military commanders began the practice [during the Civil War] of using the same name, the same rules, and often the same tribunals&#x94; to try both ordinary crimes and war crimes.

But even the Government does not go so far; although the United States had for some time prior to the attacks of September 11, 2001, been aggressively pursuing al Qaeda, neither in the charging document nor in submissions before this Court has the Government asserted that the President&#x92;s war powers were activated prior to September 11, 2001.  Cf. Brief for Respondents 25 (describing the events of September 11, 2001, as &#x93;an act of war&#x94; that &#x93;triggered a right to deploy military forces abroad to defend the United States by combating al Qaeda&#x94;).  Justice Thomas&#x92; further argument that the AUMF is &#x93;backward looking&#x94; and therefore authorizes trial by military commission of crimes that occurred prior to the inception of war is insupportable.  See post, at 8, n. 3.  If nothing else, Article 21 of the UCMJ requires that the President comply with the law of war in his use of military commissions.  As explained in the text, the law of war permits trial only of offenses &#x93;committed within the period of the war.&#x94;  Winthrop 837; see also Quirin, 317 U. S., at 28&#x96;29 (observing that law-of-war military commissions may be used to try &#x93;those enemies who in their attempt to thwart or impede our military effort have violated the law of war&#x94; (emphasis added)).  The sources that Justice Thomas relies on to suggest otherwise simply do not support his position.  Colonel Green&#x92;s short exegesis on military commissions cites Howland for the proposition that &#x93;[o]ffenses committed before a formal declaration of war or before the declaration of martial law may be tried by military commission.&#x94;  The Military Commission, 42 Am. J. Int&#x92;l L. 832, 848 (1948) (emphases added) (cited post, at 9&#x96;10).  Assuming that to be true, nothing in our analysis turns on the admitted absence of either a formal declaration of war or a declaration of martial law.  Our focus instead is on the September 11, 2001 attacks that the Government characterizes as the relevant &#x93;act[s] of war,&#x94; and on the measure that authorized the President&#x92;s deployment of military force&#x97;the AUMF.   Because we do not question the Government&#x92;s position that the war commenced with the events of September 11, 2001, the Prize Cases, 
2Black
635 (1863) (cited post, at 2, 7, 8, and 10 (Thomas, J., dissenting)), are not germane to the analysis.


Finally, Justice Thomas&#x92; assertion that Julius Otto Kuehn&#x92;s trial by military commission &#x93;for conspiring with Japanese officials to betray the United States fleet to the Imperial Japanese Government prior to its attack on Pearl Harbor&#x94; stands as authoritative precedent for Hamdan&#x92;s trial by commission, post, at 9, misses the mark in three critical respects.  First, Kuehn was tried for the federal espionage crimes under what were then 50 U. S C. &#xA7;&#xA7;31, 32, and 34, not with common-law violations of the law of war.  See Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 30, pp. 3067&#x96;3069 (1946).  Second, he was tried by martial law commission (a kind of commission Justice Thomas acknowledges is not relevant to the analysis here, and whose jurisdiction extends to offenses committed within &#x93;the exercise of . . . martial law,&#x94; Winthrop 837, see supra, n. 28), not a commission established exclusively to try violations of the law of war.  See ibid.   Third, the martial law commissions established to try crimes in Hawaii were ultimately declared illegal by this Court.  See Duncan v. Kahanamoku, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/304" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 304</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">324</a> (1946)
 (&#x93;The phrase &#x91;martial law&#x92; as employed in [the Hawaiian Organic Act], while intended to authorize the military to act vigorously for the maintenance of an orderly civil government and for the defense of the Islands against actual or threatened rebellion or invasion, was not intended to authorize the supplanting of courts by military tribunals&#x94;).
</p>
        <p class="footnote">
            <a class="fnflag" name="ZO-32" href="#ZO-32ref">32</a> Justice Thomas adopts the remarkable view, not advocated by the Government, that the charging document in this case actually includes more than one charge: Conspiracy and several other ill-defined crimes, like &#x93;joining an organization&#x94; that has a criminal purpose, &#x93; &#x91;[b]eing a guerilla,&#x92; &#x94; and aiding the enemy.  See post, at 16&#x96;21, and n. 9.  There are innumerable problems with this approach.


First, the crimes Justice Thomas identifies were not actually charged.  It is one thing to observe that charges before a military commission &#x93; &#x91;need not be stated with the precision of a common law indictment,&#x92; &#x94; post, at 15, n. 7 (citation omitted); it is quite another to say that a crime not charged may nonetheless be read into an indictment.   Second, the Government plainly had available to it the tools and the time it needed to charge petitioner with the various crimes Justice Thomas refers to, if it believed they were supported by the allegations.  As Justice Thomas himself observes, see post, at 21, the crime of aiding the enemy may, in circumstances where the accused owes allegiance to the party whose enemy he is alleged to have aided, be triable by military commission pursuant to Article 104 of the UCMJ, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/904.html" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;904</a>.  Indeed, the Government has charged detainees under this provision when it has seen fit to do so.  See Brief for David Hicks as Amicus Curiae 7.


Third, the cases Justice Thomas relies on to show that Hamdan may be guilty of violations of the law of war not actually charged do not support his argument.  Justice Thomas begins by blurring the distinction between those categories of &#x93;offender&#x94; who may be tried by military commission (e.g., jayhawkers and the like) with the &#x93;offenses&#x94; that may be so tried.  Even when it comes to &#x93; &#x91;being a guerilla,&#x92; &#x94; cf. post, at 18, n. 9 (citation omitted), a label alone does not render a person susceptible to execution or other criminal punishment; the charge of &#x93; &#x91;being a guerilla&#x92; &#x94; invariably is accompanied by the allegation that the defendant &#x93; &#x91;took up arms&#x92; &#x94; as such.  This is because, as explained by Judge Advocate General Holt in a decision upholding the charge of &#x93; &#x91;being a guerilla&#x92; &#x94; as one recognized by &#x93;the universal usage of the times,&#x94; the charge is simply shorthand (akin to &#x93;being a spy&#x94;) for &#x93;the perpetration of a succession of similar acts&#x94; of violence.  Record Books of the Judge Advocate General Office, R. 3, 590.   The sources cited by Justice Thomas confirm as much.  See cases cited post, at 18, n. 9.


Likewise, the suggestion that the Nuremberg precedents support Hamdan&#x92;s conviction for the (uncharged) crime of joining a criminal organization must fail.  Cf. post, at 19&#x96;21.  The convictions of certain high-level Nazi officials for &#x93;membership in a criminal organization&#x94; were secured pursuant to specific provisions of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal that permitted indictment of individual organization members following convictions of the organizations themselves.  See Arts. 9 and 10, in 1 Trial of the Major War Criminals Before the International Military Tribunal 12 (1947).   The initial plan to use organizations&#x92; convictions as predicates for mass individual trials ultimately was abandoned.  See T. Taylor, Anatomy of the Nuremberg Trials: A Personal Memoir 584&#x96;585, 638 (1992).

W. Rehnquist, All the Laws But One: Civil Liberties in Wartime 165&#x96;167 (1998) (analyzing the conspiracy charges in light of ordinary criminal law principles at the time), is at best an equivocal exception.  Although the charge against the defendants in that case accused them of &#x93;combining, confederating, and conspiring together&#x94; to murder the President, they were also charged (as we read the indictment, cf. post, at 23, n. 14 (Thomas, J., dissenting)) with &#x93;maliciously, unlawfully, and traitorously murdering the said Abraham Lincoln.&#x94;  H.

The charge against Lenger Grenfel and others for conspiring to release rebel prisoners held in Chicago only supports the observation, made in the text, that the Civil War tribunals often charged hybrid crimes mixing elements of crimes ordinarily triable in civilian courts (like treason) and violations of the law of war.  Judge Advocate General Holt, in recommending that Grenfel&#x92;s death sentence be upheld (it was in fact commuted by Presidential decree, see H. R. Doc.

The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), drawing on the Nuremberg precedents, has adopted a &#x93;joint criminal enterprise&#x94; theory of liability, but that is a species of liability for the substantive offense (akin to aiding and abetting), not a crime on its own.

But even if Congress was concerned with ensuring uniformity across service branches, that does not mean it did not also intend to codify the longstanding practice of procedural parity between courts-martial and other military tribunals.  Indeed, the suggestion that Congress did not intend uniformity across tribunal types is belied by the textual proximity of subsection (a) (which requires that the rules governing criminal trials in federal district courts apply, absent the President&#x92;s determination of impracticability, to courts-martial, provost courts, and military commissions alike) and subsection (b) (which imposes the uniformity requirement).

        <p class="bodytext">    On December 30, 2005, Congress enacted the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA).  It unambiguously provides that, as of that date, &#x93;no court, justice, or judge&#x94; shall have jurisdiction to consider the habeas application of a Guantanamo Bay detainee.  Notwithstanding this plain directive, the Court today concludes that, on what it calls the statute&#x92;s <em>most natural</em> reading, <em>every</em> &#x93;court, justice, or judge&#x94; before whom such a habeas application was pending on December 30 has jurisdiction to hear, consider, and render judgment on it.  This conclusion is patently erroneous.  And even if it were not, the jurisdiction supposedly retained should, in an exercise of sound equitable discretion, not be exercised.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The DTA provides: &#x93;[N]o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742 (internal division omitted).  This provision &#x93;t[ook] effect on the date of the enactment of this Act,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(h)(1), <em>id.</em>, at 2743, which was December 30, 2005.  As of that date, then, <em>no</em> court had jurisdiction to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; the merits of petitioner&#x92;s habeas application.  This repeal of jurisdiction is simply not ambiguous as between pending and future cases.  It prohibits <em>any</em> exercise of jurisdiction, and it became effective as to <em>all</em> cases last December 30.  It is also perfectly clear that the phrase &#x93;no court, <em>justice</em>, or judge&#x94; includes this Court and its Members, and that by exercising our appellate jurisdiction in this case we are &#x93;hear[ing] or consider[ing] &#x2026; an application for a writ of habeas<span class="softbreak"/>corpus.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that statutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases pending at their effective date.  For example, in <em>Bruner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/343/112" class="subref" title="subref">343 U. S. 112</a> (1952)
, we granted certiorari to consider whether the Tucker Act&#x92;s provision denying district court jurisdiction over suits by &#x93;officers&#x94; of the United States barred a suit by an <em>employee</em> of the United States.  After we granted certiorari, Congress amended the Tucker Act by adding suits by &#x93; &#x91;employees&#x92; &#x94; to the provision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 114.  This statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district courts &#x93;became effective&#x94; while the case was pending before us, <em>ibid.</em>, and made no explicit reference to pending cases.  Because the statute &#x93;did not reserve jurisdiction over pending cases,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 115, we held that it clearly ousted jurisdiction over them.  Summarizing centuries of practice, we said: &#x93;This rule&#x97;that, when a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to pending cases, all cases fall with the law&#x97;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 116&#x96;117.  See also <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/511/244" class="subref" title="subref">511 U. S. 244</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">274</a> (1994)
 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>) (&#x93;We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction terminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not, as today&#x92;s opinion for the Court would have it, a judge-made &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11, that we have invented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes.  It is simple recognition of the reality that the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.  <em>And this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To alter this plain meaning, our cases have required an explicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdiction-repealing statute.  For example, <em>Bruner</em>, as mentioned, looked to whether Congress made &#x93;any reservation as to pending cases.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117; see also <em>id.</em>, at 115 (&#x93;Congress made no provision for cases pending at the effective date of the Act withdrawing jurisdiction and, for this reason, Courts of Appeals ordered pending cases terminated for want of jurisdiction&#x94;).  Likewise, in <em>Hallowell</em> v. <em>Commons</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/239/506" class="subref" title="subref">239 U. S. 506</a> (1916)
, Justice Holmes relied on the fact that the jurisdiction-ousting provision &#x93;made no exception for pending litigation, but purported to be universal,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 508.  And in <em>Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Ritchie</em>, 
5Wall.
541 (1867), we again relied on the fact that the jurisdictional repeal was made &#x93;without any saving of such causes as that before us,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 544.  As in <em>Bruner</em>, <em>Hallowell</em>, and <em>Ritchie</em>, the DTA&#x92;s directive that &#x93;no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742, is made &#x93;without any reservation as to pending cases&#x94; and &#x93;purport[s] to be universal.&#x94;  What we stated in an earlier case remains true here: &#x93;[W]hen, if it had been the intention to confine the operation of [the jurisdictional repeal] &#x2026; to cases not pending, it would have been so easy to have said so, we must presume that Congress meant the language employed should have its usual and ordinary signification, and that the old law should be unconditionally repealed.&#x94;  <em>Railroad Co.</em> v. <em>Grant</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/98/398" class="subref" title="subref">98 U. S. 398</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">403</a> (1879)
.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court claims that I &#x93;rea[d] too much into&#x94; the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases, <em>ante</em>, at 12, n. 7, and that &#x93;the <em>Bruner</em> rule&#x94; has never been &#x93;an inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19.  But the Court sorely misdescribes <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;as if it were a kind of early-day <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, resolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative inference.  On the contrary, as described above, <em>Bruner</em> stated its holding as an unqualified &#x93;rule,&#x94; which &#x93;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117.  Though <em>Bruner</em> referred to an express savings clause elsewhere in the statute, <em>id.,</em> at 115, n. 7, it disavowed any reliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain meaning, quoting <em>Ritchie</em> at length: &#x93; &#x91;It is quite possible that this effect of the [jurisdiction-stripping statute] was not contemplated by Congress&#x2026; .  [B]ut when terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention.&#x92; &#x94;  343 U. S., at 116 (quoting 5 Wall., at 544&#x96;545).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court also attempts to evade the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases by asserting that &#x93;the &#x91;presumption&#x92; [of application to pending cases] that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption&#x97;viz., the presumption against retroactivity&#x97;in certain limited circumstances.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  I have already explained that what the Court calls a &#x93;presumption&#x94; is simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous meaning of such provisions.  But even taking it to be what the Court says, the effect upon the present case would be the same.  <em>Prospective</em> applications of a statute are &#x93;effective&#x94; upon the statute&#x92;s effective date; that is what an effective-date provision like &#xA7;1005(h)(1) <em>means</em>.<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Disregarding the plain meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the requirement of explicit exception set forth in the foregoing cases, the Court instead favors &#x93;a negative inference &#x2026; from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 13.  Specifically, it appeals to the fact that &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) are explicitly made applicable to pending cases (by &#xA7;1005(h)(2)).  A negative inference of the sort the Court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an ambiguous provision, but since the meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear, the omitted language in that context would have been redundant.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if &#xA7;1005(e)(1) were at all ambiguous in its application to pending cases, the &#x93;negative inference&#x94; from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) touted by the Court would have no force.  The numerous cases in the <em>Bruner</em> line would at least create a powerful default &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11.  The negative inference urged by the Court would be a particularly awkward and indirect way of rebutting such a longstanding and consistent practice.  This is especially true since the negative inference that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(h)(2)&#x92;s specification that certain provisions <em>shall</em> apply to pending cases is matched by a negative inference in the opposite direction that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(b)(2), which provides that certain provisions shall <em>not </em>apply to pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court&#x92;s reliance on our opinion in <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, is utterly misplaced.  <em>Lindh</em> involved two provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA): a set of amendments to chapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined the scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts; and a provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas statute specially to govern federal collateral review of state capital cases.  See 521 U. S., at 326&#x96;327.  The latter provision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applicable to cases pending at the time of AEDPA&#x92;s enactment; the former made no specific reference to pending cases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 327.  In <em>Lindh</em>, we drew a negative inference from chapter 154&#x92;s explicit reference to pending cases, to conclude that the chapter 153 amendments did <em>not</em> apply in pending cases.  It was essential to our reasoning, however, that both provisions appeared to be <em>identically difficult</em> to classify under our retroactivity cases.  First, we noted that, after <em>Landgraf</em>, there was reason for Congress to suppose that an explicit statement was required to render the amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending cases, because the new chapter 154 &#x93;will have substantive as well as purely procedural effects.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 327.  The next step&#x97;and the critical step&#x97;in our reasoning was that Congress had <em>identical</em> reason to suppose that an explicit statement would be required to apply the chapter 153 amendments to pending cases, but did not provide it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  The negative inference of <em>Lindh</em> rested on the fact that &#x93;[n]othing &#x2026; but a different intent explain[ed] the different treatment.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Here, by contrast, there is ample reason for the different treatment.  The exclusive-review provisions of the DTA, unlike both &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the AEDPA amendments in <em>Lindh</em>, confer <em>new</em> jurisdiction (in the D. C. Circuit)  where there was none before.  For better or for worse, our recent cases have contrasted jurisdiction-<em>creating</em> provisions with jurisdiction-<em>ousting</em> provisions, retaining the venerable rule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied in pending cases, but strongly indicating that the former are typically retroactive.  For example, we stated in <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)
, that a statute &#x93;that <em>creates</em> jurisdiction where none previously existed&#x94; is &#x93;as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other.&#x94;  See also <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>,

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J</span>.); <em>id.</em>, at 722 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy</span>, J., dissenting).  The Court gives our retroactivity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that &#x93;subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents.&#x94;<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            <em>Ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18.  This statement rises to the level of sarcasm when one considers its author&#x92;s description of the governing test of our retroactivity jurisprudence:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The conclusion that a particular rule operates &#x91;retroactively&#x92; comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.  Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.  However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have &#x91;sound &#x2026; instinct[s],&#x92; &#x2026; and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 270 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The only &#x93;familiar consideration,&#x94; &#x93;reasonable reliance,&#x94; and &#x93;settled expectation&#x94; I am aware of pertaining to the present case is the rule of <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;applicable to &#xA7;1005(e)(1), but not to &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)&#x97;which the Court stubbornly disregards.  It is utterly beyond question that &#xA7;1005(e)(2)&#x92;s and (3)&#x92;s application to pending cases (without explicit specification) was not as clear as &#xA7;1005(e)(1)&#x92;s.  That is alone enough to explain the difference in treatment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Another obvious reason for the specification was to stave off any Suspension Clause problems raised by the immediately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by subsection (e)(1).  That is to say, specification of the immediate effectiveness of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) (which, unlike subsection (e)(1), would not fall within the <em>Bruner </em>rule and would not <em>automatically</em> be deemed applicable in pending cases) could reasonably have been thought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas jurisdiction that subsection (e)(1) eliminated in pending cases with an adequate substitute.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These considerations by no means prove that an explicit statement would be <em>required</em> to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable in pending cases.  But they surely gave Congress ample reason to <em>doubt</em> that their application in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the Court glibly assumes.  In any event, even if it were true that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x93; &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18, this would merely establish that subsection (h)(2)&#x92;s reference to pending cases was wholly superfluous when applied to subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3), just as it would have been for subsection (e)(1).  <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference makes sense only when Congress would have perceived &#x93;the wisdom of being explicit&#x94; with respect to the immediate application of <em>both</em> of two statutory provisions, 521 U. S., at 328, but chose to be explicit only for one of them&#x97;not when it would have perceived <em>no need </em>to be explicit for both, but enacted a redundancy only for one.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, it is simply untrue that Congress &#x93; &#x91;should have been just as concerned about&#x92; &#x94; specifying the application of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) to pending cases, <em>ante</em>, at 14 (quoting <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329).  In fact, the negative-inference approach of <em>Lindh</em> is particularly inappropriate in this case, because the negative inference from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) would tend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that <em>are</em> explicitly rendered applicable in pending cases, &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3).  Those provisions purport to vest &#x93;exclusive&#x94; jurisdiction in the D. C. Circuit to consider the claims raised by petitioners here.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.  By drawing a negative inference <em>&lt;fs fs="11.5"&gt;&amp;Agrave;</em>
            <em>la</em>
            <em>Lindh</em>, the Court supplants this exclusive-review mechanism with a dual-review mechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to file applications challenging the CSRTs or military commissions before December 30, 2005.  Whatever the force of <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference in other cases, it surely should not apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision from which the negative inference is drawn.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Worst of all is the Court&#x92;s reliance on the legislative history of the DTA to buttress its implausible reading of &#xA7;1005(e)(1).  We have repeatedly held that such reliance is impermissible where, as here, the statutory language is unambiguous.  But the Court nevertheless relies both on floor statements from the Senate and (quite heavily) on the drafting history of the DTA.  To begin with floor statements: The Court urges that some &#x93;statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to&#x94; the Court&#x92;s interpretation, citing excerpts from the floor debate that support its view, <em>ante</em>, 15&#x96;16, n. 10.  The Court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor statements by the DTA&#x92;s sponsors that flatly contradict its view, because &#x93;those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record <em>after</em> the Senate debate.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Of course this observation, even if true, makes no difference unless one indulges the fantasy that Senate floor speeches are attended (like the Philippics of Demosthenes) by throngs of eager listeners, instead of being delivered (like Demosthenes&#x92; practice sessions on the beach) alone into a vast emptiness.  Whether the floor statements are spoken where no Senator hears, or written where no Senator reads, they represent at most the views of a single Senator.  In any event, the Court greatly exaggerates the one-sidedness of the portions of the floor debate that clearly occurred before the DTA&#x92;s enactment.  Some of the statements of Senator Graham, a sponsor of the bill, only make sense on the assumption that pending cases are covered.<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

            </a>  And at least one opponent of the DTA unmistakably expressed his understanding that it would terminate our jurisdiction in this very case.<a name="ZD-4ref" href="#ZD-4" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    But selectivity is not the greatest vice in the Court&#x92;s use of floor statements to resolve today&#x92;s case.  These statements were made when Members of Congress were fully aware that our continuing jurisdiction <em>over this very case</em> was at issue.  The question was divisive, and floor statements made on both sides were undoubtedly opportunistic and crafted <em>solely</em> for use in the briefs in this very litigation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 151 Cong. Rec. S14257&#x96;S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen. Levin) (arguing against a reading that would &#x93;stri[p] the Federal courts of jurisdiction to consider pending cases, <em>including the Hamdan case now pending in the Supreme Court</em>,&#x94; and urging that <em>Lindh</em> requires the same negative inference that the Court indulges today (emphasis added)).  The Court&#x92;s reliance on such statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar opportunism.  In a virtually identical context, the author of today&#x92;s opinion has written for the Court that &#x93;[t]he legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 262 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).  Likewise, the handful of floor statements that the Court treats as authoritative do not &#x93;reflec[t] any general agreement.&#x94;  They reflect the now-common tactic&#x97;which the Court once again rewards&#x97;of pursuing through floor-speech <em>ipse dixit</em> what could not be achieved through the constitutionally prescribed method of putting language into a bill that a majority of both Houses vote for and the President signs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the floor statements, at least the Court shows some semblance of seemly shame, tucking away its reference to them in a half-hearted footnote.  Not so for its reliance on the DTA&#x92;s drafting history, which is displayed prominently, see <em>ante</em>, at 14&#x96;15.  I have explained elsewhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or reliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute than any other form of legislative history.  This case presents a textbook example of its unreliability.  The Court, <em>ante</em>, at 14, trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the Senate included redundant language, not included in the DTA as passed, reconfirming that the abolition of habeas jurisdiction &#x93;shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.&#x94;  151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005).  But this earlier version of the bill also differed from the DTA in other material respects.  Most notably, it provided for postdecision review by the D. C. Circuit only of the decisions of <em>CSRTs</em>, not military commissions, <em>ibid.; </em>and it limited that review to whether &#x93;the status determination &#x2026; was consistent with the procedures and standards specified by the Secretary of Defense,&#x94; <em>ibid.,</em> not whether &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures &#x2026; is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742.  To say that what moved Senators to reject this earlier bill was the &#x93;action that is pending&#x94; provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even this Court&#x92;s greatest Justices.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">
                <sup>

                </sup>
            </a>  And to think that the House and the President also had this rejection firmly in mind is absurd.  As always&#x97;but <em>especially</em> in the context of strident, partisan legislative conflict of the sort that characterized enactment of this legislation&#x97;the language of the statute that was actually passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President is our only authoritative and only reliable guidepost.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A final but powerful indication of the fact that the Court has made a mess of this statute is the nature of the consequences that ensue.  Though this case concerns a habeas application challenging a trial by military commission, DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(1) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider <em>any</em> &#x93;application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  The vast majority of pending petitions, no doubt, do not relate to military commissions at all, but to more commonly challenged aspects of &#x93;detention&#x94; such as the terms and conditions of confinement.  See <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/466" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 466</a>,

 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  The Solicitor General represents that &#x93;[h]abeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a purported 600 [Guantanamo Bay] detainees,&#x94; including one that &#x93;seek[s] relief on behalf of every Guantanamo detainee who has not already filed an action,&#x94; Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 20, n. 10 (hereinafter Motion to Dismiss).  The Court&#x92;s interpretation transforms a provision abolishing jurisdiction over <em>all</em> Guantanamo-related habeas petitions into a provision that retains jurisdiction over cases sufficiently numerous to keep the courts busy for years to come.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Because I would hold that &#xA7;1005(e)(1) unambiguously terminates the jurisdiction of all courts to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; pending habeas applications, I must confront petitioner&#x92;s arguments that the provision, so interpreted, violates the Suspension Clause.  This claim is easily dispatched.  We stated in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">
Notwithstanding the ill-considered dicta in the Court&#x92;s opinion in <em>Rasul</em>, 542 U.

        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner has made no showing that the postdecision exclusive review by the D. C.

His principal argument is that the exclusive-review provisions are inadequate because they foreclose review of the claims he raises here.  Though petitioner&#x92;s brief does not parse the statutory language, his argument evidently rests on an erroneously narrow reading of DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  That provision grants the D. C. Circuit authority to review, &#x93;to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.&#x94;  In the quoted text, the phrase &#x93;such standards and procedures&#x94; refers to &#x93;the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (A),&#x94; namely &#x93;Military Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).&#x94;  DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(i), (e)(3)(A), <em>ibid</em>.  This Military Commission Order (Order No. 1) is the Department of Defense&#x92;s fundamental implementing order for the President&#x92;s order authorizing trials by military commission.

In short, the &#x93;standards and procedures specified in&#x94; Order No. 1 include <em>every aspect</em> of the military commissions, including the fact of their existence and every respect in which they differ from courts-martial.  Petitioner&#x92;s claims that the President lacks legal authority to try him before a military commission constitute claims that &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures,&#x94; as specified in Order No. 1, is &#x93;[in]consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii),

It is not clear how there could be any such lurking questions, in light of the aptly named &#x93;<em>Exceptions</em> Clause&#x94; of Article III, &#xA7;2, which, in making our appellate jurisdiction subject to &#x93;such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make,&#x94; explicitly permits exactly what Congress has done here.  But any doubt our prior cases might have created on this score is surely chimerical in <em>this</em> case.  As just noted, the exclusive-review provisions provide a substitute for habeas review adequate to satisfy the Suspension Clause, which <em>forbids</em> the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.  <em>A fortiori</em> they provide a substitute adequate to satisfy any implied substantive limitations, whether real or imaginary, upon the Exceptions Clause, which <em>authorizes</em> such exceptions as &#xA7;1005(e)(1).</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Even if Congress had not clearly and constitutionally eliminated jurisdiction over this case, neither this Court nor the lower courts ought to exercise it.  Traditionally, equitable principles govern both the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and the granting of the injunctive relief sought by petitioner.  See <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a>,

.  In light of Congress&#x92;s provision of an alternate avenue for petitioner&#x92;s claims in &#xA7;1005(e)(3), those equitable principles counsel that we abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In requesting abstention, the Government relies principally on <em>Councilman</em>, in which we abstained from considering a serviceman&#x92;s claim that his charge for marijuana possession was not sufficiently &#x93;service-connected&#x94; to trigger the subject-matter jurisdiction of the military courts-martial.  See 420 U. S., at 740, 758.  Admittedly, <em>Councilman</em> does not squarely control petitioner&#x92;s case, but it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence.  As the Court describes, <em>ante</em>, at 21, <em>Councilman</em> &#x93;identifie[d] two considerations of comity that together favor[ed] abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings against service personnel.&#x94;  But the Court errs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this case.  Both of them, and a third consideration not emphasized in <em>Councilman</em>, all cut in favor of abstention here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, the Court observes that <em>Councilman</em> rested in part on the fact that &#x93;military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts,&#x94; and concludes that &#x93;Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  This is true enough.  But for some reason, the Court fails to make any inquiry into whether military commission trials might involve <em>other</em> &#x93;military necessities&#x94; or &#x93;unique military exigencies,&#x94; 420 U. S., at 757, comparable in gravity to those at stake in <em>Councilman</em>.  To put this in context: The charge against the respondent in <em>Councilman</em> was the off-base possession and sale of marijuana while he was stationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, see <em>id.,</em> at 739&#x96;740.  The charge against the petitioner here is joining and actively abetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thousands of innocent American civilians without warning on September 11, 2001.  While <em>Councilman</em> held that the prosecution of the former charge involved &#x93;military necessities&#x94; counseling against our interference, the Court <em>does not even ponder the same question</em> for the latter charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The reason for the Court&#x92;s &#x93;blinkered study&#x94; of this question, <em>ante</em>, at 19, is not hard to fathom.  The principal opinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe that the trials by military commission involve any &#x93;military necessity&#x94; <em>at all:</em> &#x93;The charge&#x92;s shortcomings &#x2026; are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition &#x2026; for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 48.  This is quite at odds with the views on this subject expressed by our political branches.  Because of &#x93;military necessity,&#x94; a joint session of Congress authorized the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force,&#x94; including military commissions, &#x93;against those nations, organizations, or persons [such as petitioner] he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force, &#xA7;2(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224, note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1541.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. &#xA7;1541</a> (2000 ed., Supp. III).  In keeping with this authority, the President has determined that &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order &#x2026; to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 2001, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e) (2002).  It is not clear where the Court derives the authority&#x97;or the audacity&#x97;to contradict this determination.  If &#x93;military necessities&#x94; relating to &#x93;duty&#x94; and &#x93;discipline&#x94; required abstention in <em>Councilman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 757, military necessities relating to the disabling, deterrence, and punishment of the mass-murdering terrorists of September 11 require abstention all the more here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court further seeks to distinguish <em>Councilman</em> on the ground that &#x93;the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  To be sure, <em>Councilman</em> emphasized that &#x93;Congress created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion, who would gain over time thorough familiarity with military problems.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 758 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).  The Court contrasts this &#x93;integrated system&#x94; insulated from military influence with the review scheme established by Order No. 1, which &#x93;provides that appeal of a review panel&#x92;s decision may be had only to the Secretary of Defense himself, &#xA7;6(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, &#xA7;6(H)(6).&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if we were to accept the Court&#x92;s extraordinary assumption that the President &#x93;lack[s] the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 23,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

            </a> the Court&#x92;s description of the review scheme here is anachronistic.  As of December 30, 2005, the &#x93;fina[l]&#x94; review of decisions by military commissions is now conducted by the D. C. Circuit pursuant to &#xA7;1005(e)(3) of the DTA, and by this Court under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1254.html#1" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;1254(1)</a>.  This provision for review by Article III courts creates, if anything, a review scheme <em>more</em> insulated from Executive control than that in <em>Councilman</em>.<a name="ZD-9ref" href="#ZD-9" class="">

                    <b>9</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  At the time we decided <em>Councilman</em>, Congress had not &#x93;conferred on any Art[icle] III court jurisdiction directly to review court-martial determinations.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 746.  The final arbiter of direct appeals was the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), an Article I court whose members possessed neither life tenure, nor salary protection, nor the constitutional protection from removal provided to federal judges in Article III, &#xA7;1.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/867.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;867(a)(2)</a> (1970 ed.).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Moreover, a third consideration counsels strongly in favor of abstention in this case.  <em>Councilman</em> reasoned that the &#x93;considerations of comity, the necessity of respect for coordinate judicial systems&#x94; that motivated our decision in <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
, were inapplicable to courts-martial, because &#x93;the particular demands of federalism are not implicated.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 756, 757.  Though military commissions likewise do not implicate &#x93;the particular demands of federalism,&#x94; considerations of <em>interbranch</em> comity at the federal level weigh heavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case.  Here, apparently for the first time in history, see Motion to Dismiss 6, a District Court enjoined ongoing military commission proceedings, which had been deemed &#x93;necessary&#x94; by the President &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e).  Such an order brings the Judicial Branch into direct conflict with the Executive in an area where the Executive&#x92;s competence is maximal and ours is virtually nonexistent.  We should exercise our equitable discretion to <em>avoid</em> such conflict.  Instead, the Court rushes headlong to meet it.  Elsewhere, we have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state courts have &#x93;the first opportunity to review&#x94; a petitioner&#x92;s claim, merely to &#x93;reduc[e] friction between the state and federal court systems.&#x94;  <em>O&#x92;Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/526/838" class="subref" title="subref">526 U. S. 838</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">844</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">845</a> (1999)
.  The &#x93;friction&#x94; created today between this Court and the Executive Branch is many times more serious.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the face of such concerns, the Court relies heavily on <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/1" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 1</a> (1942)
: &#x93;Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, [in <em>Quirin</em>] we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  It is likely that the Government in <em>Quirin</em>, unlike here, preferred a hasty resolution of the case in this Court, so that it could swiftly execute the sentences imposed, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/507" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 507</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">569</a> (2004)
 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J</span>., dissenting).  But the Court&#x92;s reliance on <em>Quirin</em> suffers from a more fundamental defect: Once again, it ignores the DTA, which creates an avenue for the consideration of petitioner&#x92;s claims that did not exist at the time of <em>Quirin</em>.  Collateral application for habeas review was the <em>only</em> vehicle available.  And there was no compelling reason to postpone consideration of the <em>Quirin</em> application until the termination of military proceedings, because the only cognizable claims presented were general challenges to the authority of the commissions that would not be affected by the specific proceedings.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8&#x96;9, n. 2.  In the DTA, by contrast, Congress has expanded the scope of Article III review and has channeled it exclusively through a single, postverdict appeal to Article III courts.  Because Congress has created a novel unitary scheme of Article III review of military commissions that was absent in 1942, <em>Quirin</em> is no longer governing precedent.</p>

, to the effect that &#x93;a statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.&#x94;  Ante, at 14, n. 9 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).  But this quote merely restates the obvious: An effective-date provision does not render a statute applicable to &#x93;conduct that occurred at an earlier date,&#x94; but of course it renders the statute applicable to conduct that occurs on the effective date and all future dates&#x97;such as the Court&#x92;s exercise of jurisdiction here.  The Court seems to suggest that, because the effective-date provision does not authorize retroactive application, it also fails to authorize prospective application (and is thus useless verbiage).  This cannot be true.

, shows this not to be true.  Subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) of &#xA7;1005 resemble the provisions of AEDPA at issue in Lindh (whose retroactivityas applied to pending cases the Lindh majority did not rule upon,see 521 U. S., at 326), in that they &#x93;g[o] beyond &#x91;mere&#x92; procedure,&#x94;id., at 327.  They impose novel and unprecedented disabilities onthe Executive Branch in its conduct of military affairs.  Subsection (e)(2) imposes judicial review on the Combatant Status ReviewTribunals (CSRTs), whose implementing order did not subject themto review by Article III courts. See Memorandum from Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz re: Order Establishing Com-batant Status Review Tribunals, at 3 &#xA7;h (July 7, 2004), avail-able at http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040707review.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 27, 2006, and availablein Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743. Historically, federal courts have never reviewed the validity of the final decision of any military commission; their jurisdiction has been restricted to considering the commission&#x92;s &#x93;lawful authority to hear, decide and condemn,&#x94;  In re Yamashita,

.  Thus, contrary to the Court&#x92;s suggestion, ante, at 17, subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) confer new jurisdiction: They impose judicial oversight on a traditionally unreviewable exercise of military authority by the Commander in Chief.

2743.  The relevance of this observation to the abstention question is unfathomable.  The fact that Article III review is discretionary does not mean that it lacks &#x93;structural insulation from military influence,&#x94; ante, at 23, and its discretionary nature presents no obstacle to the courts&#x92; future review these cases.


The Court might more cogently have relied on the discretionary nature of review to argue that the statute provides an inadequate substitute for habeas review under the Suspension Clause.  See supra, at 16&#x96;18.  But this argument would have no force, even if all appeals to the D. C. Circuit were discretionary.  The exercise of habeas jurisdiction has traditionally been entirely a matter of the court&#x92;s equitable discretion, see Withrow v. Williams,

        <p class="bodytext">    On December 30, 2005, Congress enacted the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA).  It unambiguously provides that, as of that date, &#x93;no court, justice, or judge&#x94; shall have jurisdiction to consider the habeas application of a Guantanamo Bay detainee.  Notwithstanding this plain directive, the Court today concludes that, on what it calls the statute&#x92;s <em>most natural</em> reading, <em>every</em> &#x93;court, justice, or judge&#x94; before whom such a habeas application was pending on December 30 has jurisdiction to hear, consider, and render judgment on it.  This conclusion is patently erroneous.  And even if it were not, the jurisdiction supposedly retained should, in an exercise of sound equitable discretion, not be exercised.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    The DTA provides: &#x93;[N]o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  &#xA7;1005(e)(1),

2742 (internal division omitted).  This provision &#x93;t[ook] effect on the date of the enactment of this Act,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(h)(1), <em>id.</em>, at 2743, which was December 30, 2005.  As of that date, then, <em>no</em> court had jurisdiction to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; the merits of petitioner&#x92;s habeas application.  This repeal of jurisdiction is simply not ambiguous as between pending and future cases.  It prohibits <em>any</em> exercise of jurisdiction, and it became effective as to <em>all</em> cases last December 30.  It is also perfectly clear that the phrase &#x93;no court, <em>justice</em>, or judge&#x94; includes this Court and its Members, and that by exercising our appellate jurisdiction in this case we are &#x93;hear[ing] or consider[ing] &#x2026; an application for a writ of habeas<span class="softbreak"/>corpus.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that statutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases pending at their effective date.  For example, in <em>Bruner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/343/112" class="subref" title="subref">343 U. S. 112</a> (1952)
, we granted certiorari to consider whether the Tucker Act&#x92;s provision denying district court jurisdiction over suits by &#x93;officers&#x94; of the United States barred a suit by an <em>employee</em> of the United States.  After we granted certiorari, Congress amended the Tucker Act by adding suits by &#x93; &#x91;employees&#x92; &#x94; to the provision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 114.  This statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district courts &#x93;became effective&#x94; while the case was pending before us, <em>ibid.</em>, and made no explicit reference to pending cases.  Because the statute &#x93;did not reserve jurisdiction over pending cases,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 115, we held that it clearly ousted jurisdiction over them.  Summarizing centuries of practice, we said: &#x93;This rule&#x97;that, when a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to pending cases, all cases fall with the law&#x97;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 116&#x96;117.

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>) (&#x93;We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction terminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not, as today&#x92;s opinion for the Court would have it, a judge-made &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11, that we have invented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes.  It is simple recognition of the reality that the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.  <em>And this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To alter this plain meaning, our cases have required an explicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdiction-repealing statute.  For example, <em>Bruner</em>, as mentioned, looked to whether Congress made &#x93;any reservation as to pending cases.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117; see also <em>id.</em>, at 115 (&#x93;Congress made no provision for cases pending at the effective date of the Act withdrawing jurisdiction and, for this reason, Courts of Appeals ordered pending cases terminated for want of jurisdiction&#x94;).  Likewise, in <em>Hallowell</em> v. <em>Commons</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/239/506" class="subref" title="subref">239 U. S. 506</a> (1916)
, Justice Holmes relied on the fact that the jurisdiction-ousting provision &#x93;made no exception for pending litigation, but purported to be universal,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 508.  And in <em>Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Ritchie</em>, 
5Wall.
541 (1867), we again relied on the fact that the jurisdictional repeal was made &#x93;without any saving of such causes as that before us,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 544.  As in <em>Bruner</em>, <em>Hallowell</em>, and <em>Ritchie</em>, the DTA&#x92;s directive that &#x93;no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742, is made &#x93;without any reservation as to pending cases&#x94; and &#x93;purport[s] to be universal.&#x94;  What we stated in an earlier case remains true here: &#x93;[W]hen, if it had been the intention to confine the operation of [the jurisdictional repeal] &#x2026; to cases not pending, it would have been so easy to have said so, we must presume that Congress meant the language employed should have its usual and ordinary signification, and that the old law should be unconditionally repealed.&#x94;  <em>Railroad Co.</em> v. <em>Grant</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    The Court claims that I &#x93;rea[d] too much into&#x94; the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases, <em>ante</em>, at 12, n. 7, and that &#x93;the <em>Bruner</em> rule&#x94; has never been &#x93;an inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19.  But the Court sorely misdescribes <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;as if it were a kind of early-day <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, resolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative inference.  On the contrary, as described above, <em>Bruner</em> stated its holding as an unqualified &#x93;rule,&#x94; which &#x93;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117.  Though <em>Bruner</em> referred to an express savings clause elsewhere in the statute, <em>id.,</em> at 115, n. 7, it disavowed any reliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain meaning, quoting <em>Ritchie</em> at length: &#x93; &#x91;It is quite possible that this effect of the [jurisdiction-stripping statute] was not contemplated by Congress&#x2026; .  [B]ut when terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention.&#x92; &#x94;  343 U. S., at 116 (quoting 5 Wall., at 544&#x96;545).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court also attempts to evade the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases by asserting that &#x93;the &#x91;presumption&#x92; [of application to pending cases] that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption&#x97;viz., the presumption against retroactivity&#x97;in certain limited circumstances.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  I have already explained that what the Court calls a &#x93;presumption&#x94; is simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous meaning of such provisions.  But even taking it to be what the Court says, the effect upon the present case would be the same.  <em>Prospective</em> applications of a statute are &#x93;effective&#x94; upon the statute&#x92;s effective date; that is what an effective-date provision like &#xA7;1005(h)(1) <em>means</em>.<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

            </a>  &#x93; &#x91;[S]hall take effect upon enactment&#x92; is presumed to mean &#x91;shall have prospective effect upon enactment,&#x92; and that presumption is too strong to be overcome by any negative inference [drawn from other provisions of the statute].&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 288 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, concurring in judgments).  The Court&#x92;s &#x93;nonapplication of &#x2026; the presumption against retroactivity&#x94; to &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is thus just another way of stating that the statute takes immediate effect in pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Though the Court resists the <em>Bruner</em> rule, it cannot cite a<em> single case</em> in the history of Anglo-American law (before today) in which a jurisdiction-stripping provision was denied immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation.  By contrast, the cases granting such immediate effect are legion, and they repeatedly rely on the plain language of the jurisdictional repeal as an &#x93;inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19, by requiring an express reservation to save pending cases.

        <p class="bodytext">    Disregarding the plain meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the requirement of explicit exception set forth in the foregoing cases, the Court instead favors &#x93;a negative inference &#x2026; from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 13.  Specifically, it appeals to the fact that &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) are explicitly made applicable to pending cases (by &#xA7;1005(h)(2)).  A negative inference of the sort the Court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an ambiguous provision, but since the meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear, the omitted language in that context would have been redundant.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if &#xA7;1005(e)(1) were at all ambiguous in its application to pending cases, the &#x93;negative inference&#x94; from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) touted by the Court would have no force.  The numerous cases in the <em>Bruner</em> line would at least create a powerful default &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11.  The negative inference urged by the Court would be a particularly awkward and indirect way of rebutting such a longstanding and consistent practice.  This is especially true since the negative inference that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(h)(2)&#x92;s specification that certain provisions <em>shall</em> apply to pending cases is matched by a negative inference in the opposite direction that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(b)(2), which provides that certain provisions shall <em>not </em>apply to pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court&#x92;s reliance on our opinion in <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, is utterly misplaced.  <em>Lindh</em> involved two provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA): a set of amendments to chapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined the scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts; and a provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas statute specially to govern federal collateral review of state capital cases.  See 521 U. S., at 326&#x96;327.  The latter provision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applicable to cases pending at the time of AEDPA&#x92;s enactment; the former made no specific reference to pending cases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 327.  In <em>Lindh</em>, we drew a negative inference from chapter 154&#x92;s explicit reference to pending cases, to conclude that the chapter 153 amendments did <em>not</em> apply in pending cases.  It was essential to our reasoning, however, that both provisions appeared to be <em>identically difficult</em> to classify under our retroactivity cases.  First, we noted that, after <em>Landgraf</em>, there was reason for Congress to suppose that an explicit statement was required to render the amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending cases, because the new chapter 154 &#x93;will have substantive as well as purely procedural effects.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 327.  The next step&#x97;and the critical step&#x97;in our reasoning was that Congress had <em>identical</em> reason to suppose that an explicit statement would be required to apply the chapter 153 amendments to pending cases, but did not provide it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  The negative inference of <em>Lindh</em> rested on the fact that &#x93;[n]othing &#x2026; but a different intent explain[ed] the different treatment.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Here, by contrast, there is ample reason for the different treatment.  The exclusive-review provisions of the DTA, unlike both &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the AEDPA amendments in <em>Lindh</em>, confer <em>new</em> jurisdiction (in the D. C. Circuit)  where there was none before.  For better or for worse, our recent cases have contrasted jurisdiction-<em>creating</em> provisions with jurisdiction-<em>ousting</em> provisions, retaining the venerable rule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied in pending cases, but strongly indicating that the former are typically retroactive.  For example, we stated in <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)
, that a statute &#x93;that <em>creates</em> jurisdiction where none previously existed&#x94; is &#x93;as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other.&#x94;  See also <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>,

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J</span>.); <em>id.</em>, at 722 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy</span>, J., dissenting).  The Court gives our retroactivity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that &#x93;subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents.&#x94;<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            <em>Ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18.  This statement rises to the level of sarcasm when one considers its author&#x92;s description of the governing test of our retroactivity jurisprudence:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The conclusion that a particular rule operates &#x91;retroactively&#x92; comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.  Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.  However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have &#x91;sound &#x2026; instinct[s],&#x92; &#x2026; and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 270 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The only &#x93;familiar consideration,&#x94; &#x93;reasonable reliance,&#x94; and &#x93;settled expectation&#x94; I am aware of pertaining to the present case is the rule of <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;applicable to &#xA7;1005(e)(1), but not to &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)&#x97;which the Court stubbornly disregards.  It is utterly beyond question that &#xA7;1005(e)(2)&#x92;s and (3)&#x92;s application to pending cases (without explicit specification) was not as clear as &#xA7;1005(e)(1)&#x92;s.  That is alone enough to explain the difference in treatment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Another obvious reason for the specification was to stave off any Suspension Clause problems raised by the immediately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by subsection (e)(1).  That is to say, specification of the immediate effectiveness of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) (which, unlike subsection (e)(1), would not fall within the <em>Bruner </em>rule and would not <em>automatically</em> be deemed applicable in pending cases) could reasonably have been thought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas jurisdiction that subsection (e)(1) eliminated in pending cases with an adequate substitute.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These considerations by no means prove that an explicit statement would be <em>required</em> to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable in pending cases.  But they surely gave Congress ample reason to <em>doubt</em> that their application in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the Court glibly assumes.  In any event, even if it were true that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x93; &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18, this would merely establish that subsection (h)(2)&#x92;s reference to pending cases was wholly superfluous when applied to subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3), just as it would have been for subsection (e)(1).  <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference makes sense only when Congress would have perceived &#x93;the wisdom of being explicit&#x94; with respect to the immediate application of <em>both</em> of two statutory provisions, 521 U. S., at 328, but chose to be explicit only for one of them&#x97;not when it would have perceived <em>no need </em>to be explicit for both, but enacted a redundancy only for one.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, it is simply untrue that Congress &#x93; &#x91;should have been just as concerned about&#x92; &#x94; specifying the application of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) to pending cases, <em>ante</em>, at 14 (quoting <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329).  In fact, the negative-inference approach of <em>Lindh</em> is particularly inappropriate in this case, because the negative inference from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) would tend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that <em>are</em> explicitly rendered applicable in pending cases, &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3).  Those provisions purport to vest &#x93;exclusive&#x94; jurisdiction in the D. C. Circuit to consider the claims raised by petitioners here.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.  By drawing a negative inference <em>&lt;fs fs="11.5"&gt;&amp;Agrave;</em>

            <em>Lindh</em>, the Court supplants this exclusive-review mechanism with a dual-review mechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to file applications challenging the CSRTs or military commissions before December 30, 2005.  Whatever the force of <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference in other cases, it surely should not apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision from which the negative inference is drawn.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Worst of all is the Court&#x92;s reliance on the legislative history of the DTA to buttress its implausible reading of &#xA7;1005(e)(1).  We have repeatedly held that such reliance is impermissible where, as here, the statutory language is unambiguous.  But the Court nevertheless relies both on floor statements from the Senate and (quite heavily) on the drafting history of the DTA.  To begin with floor statements: The Court urges that some &#x93;statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to&#x94; the Court&#x92;s interpretation, citing excerpts from the floor debate that support its view, <em>ante</em>, 15&#x96;16, n. 10.  The Court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor statements by the DTA&#x92;s sponsors that flatly contradict its view, because &#x93;those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record <em>after</em> the Senate debate.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Of course this observation, even if true, makes no difference unless one indulges the fantasy that Senate floor speeches are attended (like the Philippics of Demosthenes) by throngs of eager listeners, instead of being delivered (like Demosthenes&#x92; practice sessions on the beach) alone into a vast emptiness.  Whether the floor statements are spoken where no Senator hears, or written where no Senator reads, they represent at most the views of a single Senator.  In any event, the Court greatly exaggerates the one-sidedness of the portions of the floor debate that clearly occurred before the DTA&#x92;s enactment.  Some of the statements of Senator Graham, a sponsor of the bill, only make sense on the assumption that pending cases are covered.<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    But selectivity is not the greatest vice in the Court&#x92;s use of floor statements to resolve today&#x92;s case.  These statements were made when Members of Congress were fully aware that our continuing jurisdiction <em>over this very case</em> was at issue.  The question was divisive, and floor statements made on both sides were undoubtedly opportunistic and crafted <em>solely</em> for use in the briefs in this very litigation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 151 Cong. Rec. S14257&#x96;S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen. Levin) (arguing against a reading that would &#x93;stri[p] the Federal courts of jurisdiction to consider pending cases, <em>including the Hamdan case now pending in the Supreme Court</em>,&#x94; and urging that <em>Lindh</em> requires the same negative inference that the Court indulges today (emphasis added)).  The Court&#x92;s reliance on such statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar opportunism.  In a virtually identical context, the author of today&#x92;s opinion has written for the Court that &#x93;[t]he legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 262 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).  Likewise, the handful of floor statements that the Court treats as authoritative do not &#x93;reflec[t] any general agreement.&#x94;  They reflect the now-common tactic&#x97;which the Court once again rewards&#x97;of pursuing through floor-speech <em>ipse dixit</em> what could not be achieved through the constitutionally prescribed method of putting language into a bill that a majority of both Houses vote for and the President signs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the floor statements, at least the Court shows some semblance of seemly shame, tucking away its reference to them in a half-hearted footnote.  Not so for its reliance on the DTA&#x92;s drafting history, which is displayed prominently, see <em>ante</em>, at 14&#x96;15.  I have explained elsewhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or reliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute than any other form of legislative history.  This case presents a textbook example of its unreliability.  The Court, <em>ante</em>, at 14, trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the Senate included redundant language, not included in the DTA as passed, reconfirming that the abolition of habeas jurisdiction &#x93;shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.&#x94;  151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005).  But this earlier version of the bill also differed from the DTA in other material respects.  Most notably, it provided for postdecision review by the D. C. Circuit only of the decisions of <em>CSRTs</em>, not military commissions, <em>ibid.; </em>and it limited that review to whether &#x93;the status determination &#x2026; was consistent with the procedures and standards specified by the Secretary of Defense,&#x94; <em>ibid.,</em> not whether &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures &#x2026; is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742.  To say that what moved Senators to reject this earlier bill was the &#x93;action that is pending&#x94; provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even this Court&#x92;s greatest Justices.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  And to think that the House and the President also had this rejection firmly in mind is absurd.  As always&#x97;but <em>especially</em> in the context of strident, partisan legislative conflict of the sort that characterized enactment of this legislation&#x97;the language of the statute that was actually passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President is our only authoritative and only reliable guidepost.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A final but powerful indication of the fact that the Court has made a mess of this statute is the nature of the consequences that ensue.  Though this case concerns a habeas application challenging a trial by military commission, DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(1) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider <em>any</em> &#x93;application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  The vast majority of pending petitions, no doubt, do not relate to military commissions at all, but to more commonly challenged aspects of &#x93;detention&#x94; such as the terms and conditions of confinement.  See <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/466" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 466</a>,

 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  The Solicitor General represents that &#x93;[h]abeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a purported 600 [Guantanamo Bay] detainees,&#x94; including one that &#x93;seek[s] relief on behalf of every Guantanamo detainee who has not already filed an action,&#x94; Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 20, n. 10 (hereinafter Motion to Dismiss).  The Court&#x92;s interpretation transforms a provision abolishing jurisdiction over <em>all</em> Guantanamo-related habeas petitions into a provision that retains jurisdiction over cases sufficiently numerous to keep the courts busy for years to come.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Because I would hold that &#xA7;1005(e)(1) unambiguously terminates the jurisdiction of all courts to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; pending habeas applications, I must confront petitioner&#x92;s arguments that the provision, so interpreted, violates the Suspension Clause.  This claim is easily dispatched.  We stated in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/339/763" class="subref" title="subref">339 U. S. 763</a>,

:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;We are cited to no instance where a court, in this or any other country where the writ is known, has issued it on behalf of an alien enemy who, at no relevant time and in no stage of his captivity, has been within its territorial jurisdiction.  Nothing in the text of the Constitution extends such a right, nor does anything in our statutes.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Notwithstanding the ill-considered dicta in the Court&#x92;s opinion in <em>Rasul</em>, 542 U. S., at 480&#x96;481, it is clear that Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is outside the sovereign &#x93;territorial jurisdiction&#x94; of the United States.  See <em>id.</em>, at 500&#x96;505 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  Petitioner, an enemy alien detained abroad, has no rights under the Suspension Clause.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But even if petitioner were fully protected by the Clause, the DTA would create no suspension problem.  This Court has repeatedly acknowledged that &#x93;the substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person&#x92;s detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.&#x94;  <em>Swain</em> v. <em>Pressley</em>,

 (&#x93;Congress could, without raising any constitutional questions, provide an adequate substitute through the courts of appeals&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner has made no showing that the postdecision exclusive review by the D. C. Circuit provided in &#xA7;1005(e)(3) is inadequate to test the legality of his trial by military commission.  His principal argument is that the exclusive-review provisions are inadequate because they foreclose review of the claims he raises here.  Though petitioner&#x92;s brief does not parse the statutory language, his argument evidently rests on an erroneously narrow reading of DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  That provision grants the D. C. Circuit authority to review, &#x93;to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.&#x94;  In the quoted text, the phrase &#x93;such standards and procedures&#x94; refers to &#x93;the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (A),&#x94; namely &#x93;Military Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).&#x94;  DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(i), (e)(3)(A), <em>ibid</em>.  This Military Commission Order (Order No. 1) is the Department of Defense&#x92;s fundamental implementing order for the President&#x92;s order authorizing trials by military commission.  Order No. 1 establishes commissions, &#xA7;2; delineates their jurisdiction, &#xA7;3; provides for their officers, &#xA7;4(A); provides for their prosecution and defense counsel, &#xA7;4(B), (C); lays out all their procedures, both pretrial and trial, &#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P), &#xA7;6(A)&#x96;(G); and provides for posttrial military review through the Secretary of Defense and the President, &#xA7;6(H).  In short, the &#x93;standards and procedures specified in&#x94; Order No. 1 include <em>every aspect</em> of the military commissions, including the fact of their existence and every respect in which they differ from courts-martial.  Petitioner&#x92;s claims that the President lacks legal authority to try him before a military commission constitute claims that &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures,&#x94; as specified in Order No. 1, is &#x93;[in]consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  The D. C. Circuit thus retains jurisdiction to consider these claims on postdecision review, and the Government does not dispute that the DTA leaves unaffected our certiorari jurisdiction under

Thus, the DTA merely <em>defers</em> our jurisdiction to consider petitioner&#x92;s claims; it does not eliminate that jurisdiction.  It constitutes neither an &#x93;inadequate&#x94; nor an &#x93;ineffective&#x94; substitute for petitioner&#x92;s pending habeas application.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Though it does not squarely address the issue, the Court hints ominously that &#x93;the Government&#x92;s preferred reading&#x94; would &#x93;rais[e] grave questions about Congress&#x92; authority to impinge upon this Court&#x92;s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 10&#x96;11 (citing <em>Ex parte Yerger</em>, 
8Wall.
85 (1869); <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin</em>,

It is not clear how there could be any such lurking questions, in light of the aptly named &#x93;<em>Exceptions</em> Clause&#x94; of Article III, &#xA7;2, which, in making our appellate jurisdiction subject to &#x93;such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make,&#x94; explicitly permits exactly what Congress has done here.  But any doubt our prior cases might have created on this score is surely chimerical in <em>this</em> case.  As just noted, the exclusive-review provisions provide a substitute for habeas review adequate to satisfy the Suspension Clause, which <em>forbids</em> the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.  <em>A fortiori</em> they provide a substitute adequate to satisfy any implied substantive limitations, whether real or imaginary, upon the Exceptions Clause, which <em>authorizes</em> such exceptions as &#xA7;1005(e)(1).</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if Congress had not clearly and constitutionally eliminated jurisdiction over this case, neither this Court nor the lower courts ought to exercise it.  Traditionally, equitable principles govern both the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and the granting of the injunctive relief sought by petitioner.  See <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a>,

.  In light of Congress&#x92;s provision of an alternate avenue for petitioner&#x92;s claims in &#xA7;1005(e)(3), those equitable principles counsel that we abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In requesting abstention, the Government relies principally on <em>Councilman</em>, in which we abstained from considering a serviceman&#x92;s claim that his charge for marijuana possession was not sufficiently &#x93;service-connected&#x94; to trigger the subject-matter jurisdiction of the military courts-martial.  See 420 U. S., at 740, 758.  Admittedly, <em>Councilman</em> does not squarely control petitioner&#x92;s case, but it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence.  As the Court describes, <em>ante</em>, at 21, <em>Councilman</em> &#x93;identifie[d] two considerations of comity that together favor[ed] abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings against service personnel.&#x94;  But the Court errs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this case.  Both of them, and a third consideration not emphasized in <em>Councilman</em>, all cut in favor of abstention here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, the Court observes that <em>Councilman</em> rested in part on the fact that &#x93;military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts,&#x94; and concludes that &#x93;Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  This is true enough.  But for some reason, the Court fails to make any inquiry into whether military commission trials might involve <em>other</em> &#x93;military necessities&#x94; or &#x93;unique military exigencies,&#x94; 420 U. S., at 757, comparable in gravity to those at stake in <em>Councilman</em>.  To put this in context: The charge against the respondent in <em>Councilman</em> was the off-base possession and sale of marijuana while he was stationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, see <em>id.,</em> at 739&#x96;740.  The charge against the petitioner here is joining and actively abetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thousands of innocent American civilians without warning on September 11, 2001.  While <em>Councilman</em> held that the prosecution of the former charge involved &#x93;military necessities&#x94; counseling against our interference, the Court <em>does not even ponder the same question</em> for the latter charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The reason for the Court&#x92;s &#x93;blinkered study&#x94; of this question, <em>ante</em>, at 19, is not hard to fathom.  The principal opinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe that the trials by military commission involve any &#x93;military necessity&#x94; <em>at all:</em> &#x93;The charge&#x92;s shortcomings &#x2026; are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition &#x2026; for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 48.  This is quite at odds with the views on this subject expressed by our political branches.  Because of &#x93;military necessity,&#x94; a joint session of Congress authorized the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force,&#x94; including military commissions, &#x93;against those nations, organizations, or persons [such as petitioner] he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force, &#xA7;2(a),

224, note following

In keeping with this authority, the President has determined that &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order &#x2026; to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 2001, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e) (2002).  It is not clear where the Court derives the authority&#x97;or the audacity&#x97;to contradict this determination.  If &#x93;military necessities&#x94; relating to &#x93;duty&#x94; and &#x93;discipline&#x94; required abstention in <em>Councilman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 757, military necessities relating to the disabling, deterrence, and punishment of the mass-murdering terrorists of September 11 require abstention all the more here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court further seeks to distinguish <em>Councilman</em> on the ground that &#x93;the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  To be sure, <em>Councilman</em> emphasized that &#x93;Congress created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion, who would gain over time thorough familiarity with military problems.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 758 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).  The Court contrasts this &#x93;integrated system&#x94; insulated from military influence with the review scheme established by Order No. 1, which &#x93;provides that appeal of a review panel&#x92;s decision may be had only to the Secretary of Defense himself, &#xA7;6(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, &#xA7;6(H)(6).&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if we were to accept the Court&#x92;s extraordinary assumption that the President &#x93;lack[s] the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 23,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

            </a>  At the time we decided <em>Councilman</em>, Congress had not &#x93;conferred on any Art[icle] III court jurisdiction directly to review court-martial determinations.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 746.  The final arbiter of direct appeals was the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), an Article I court whose members possessed neither life tenure, nor salary protection, nor the constitutional protection from removal provided to federal judges in Article III, &#xA7;1.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/867.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;867(a)(2)</a> (1970 ed.).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Moreover, a third consideration counsels strongly in favor of abstention in this case.  <em>Councilman</em> reasoned that the &#x93;considerations of comity, the necessity of respect for coordinate judicial systems&#x94; that motivated our decision in <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
, were inapplicable to courts-martial, because &#x93;the particular demands of federalism are not implicated.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 756, 757.  Though military commissions likewise do not implicate &#x93;the particular demands of federalism,&#x94; considerations of <em>interbranch</em> comity at the federal level weigh heavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case.  Here, apparently for the first time in history, see Motion to Dismiss 6, a District Court enjoined ongoing military commission proceedings, which had been deemed &#x93;necessary&#x94; by the President &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e).  Such an order brings the Judicial Branch into direct conflict with the Executive in an area where the Executive&#x92;s competence is maximal and ours is virtually nonexistent.  We should exercise our equitable discretion to <em>avoid</em> such conflict.  Instead, the Court rushes headlong to meet it.  Elsewhere, we have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state courts have &#x93;the first opportunity to review&#x94; a petitioner&#x92;s claim, merely to &#x93;reduc[e] friction between the state and federal court systems.&#x94;  <em>O&#x92;Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    In the face of such concerns, the Court relies heavily on <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/1" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 1</a> (1942)
: &#x93;Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, [in <em>Quirin</em>] we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  It is likely that the Government in <em>Quirin</em>, unlike here, preferred a hasty resolution of the case in this Court, so that it could swiftly execute the sentences imposed, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>,

 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J</span>., dissenting).  But the Court&#x92;s reliance on <em>Quirin</em> suffers from a more fundamental defect: Once again, it ignores the DTA, which creates an avenue for the consideration of petitioner&#x92;s claims that did not exist at the time of <em>Quirin</em>.  Collateral application for habeas review was the <em>only</em> vehicle available.  And there was no compelling reason to postpone consideration of the <em>Quirin</em> application until the termination of military proceedings, because the only cognizable claims presented were general challenges to the authority of the commissions that would not be affected by the specific proceedings.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8&#x96;9, n. 2.  In the DTA, by contrast, Congress has expanded the scope of Article III review and has channeled it exclusively through a single, postverdict appeal to Article III courts.  Because Congress has created a novel unitary scheme of Article III review of military commissions that was absent in 1942, <em>Quirin</em> is no longer governing precedent.</p>

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-1" href="#ZD-1ref">1</a> The Court apparently believes that the effective-date provision means nothing at all.  &#x93;That paragraph (1), along with paragraphs (2) and (3), is to &#x91;take effect on the date of enactment,&#x92; DTA &#xA7;1005(h)(1),

, to the effect that &#x93;a statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.&#x94;  Ante, at 14, n. 9 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).  But this quote merely restates the obvious: An effective-date provision does not render a statute applicable to &#x93;conduct that occurred at an earlier date,&#x94; but of course it renders the statute applicable to conduct that occurs on the effective date and all future dates&#x97;such as the Court&#x92;s exercise of jurisdiction here.  The Court seems to suggest that, because the effective-date provision does not authorize retroactive application, it also fails to authorize prospective application (and is thus useless verbiage).  This cannot be true.

, shows this not to be true.  Subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) of &#xA7;1005 resemble the provisions of AEDPA at issue in Lindh (whose retroactivityas applied to pending cases the Lindh majority did not rule upon,see 521 U.

Subsection (e)(2) imposes judicial review on the Combatant Status ReviewTribunals (CSRTs), whose implementing order did not subject themto review by Article III courts. See Memorandum from Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz re: Order Establishing Com-batant Status Review Tribunals, at 3 &#xA7;h (July 7, 2004), avail-able at http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040707review.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 27, 2006, and availablein Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743. Historically, federal courts have never reviewed the validity of the final decision of any military commission; their jurisdiction has been restricted to considering the commission&#x92;s &#x93;lawful authority to hear, decide and condemn,&#x94;  In re Yamashita,

Thus, contrary to the Court&#x92;s suggestion, ante, at 17, subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) confer new jurisdiction: They impose judicial oversight on a traditionally unreviewable exercise of military authority by the Commander in Chief.

2743.  The relevance of this observation to the abstention question is unfathomable.  The fact that Article III review is discretionary does not mean that it lacks &#x93;structural insulation from military influence,&#x94; ante, at 23, and its discretionary nature presents no obstacle to the courts&#x92; future review these cases.


The Court might more cogently have relied on the discretionary nature of review to argue that the statute provides an inadequate substitute for habeas review under the Suspension Clause.  See supra, at 16&#x96;18.  But this argument would have no force, even if all appeals to the D. C. Circuit were discretionary.  The exercise of habeas jurisdiction has traditionally been entirely a matter of the court&#x92;s equitable discretion, see Withrow v. Williams,

        <p class="bodytext">    On December 30, 2005, Congress enacted the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA).  It unambiguously provides that, as of that date, &#x93;no court, justice, or judge&#x94; shall have jurisdiction to consider the habeas application of a Guantanamo Bay detainee.  Notwithstanding this plain directive, the Court today concludes that, on what it calls the statute&#x92;s <em>most natural</em> reading, <em>every</em> &#x93;court, justice, or judge&#x94; before whom such a habeas application was pending on December 30 has jurisdiction to hear, consider, and render judgment on it.  This conclusion is patently erroneous.  And even if it were not, the jurisdiction supposedly retained should, in an exercise of sound equitable discretion, not be exercised.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The DTA provides: &#x93;[N]o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742 (internal division omitted).  This provision &#x93;t[ook] effect on the date of the enactment of this Act,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(h)(1), <em>id.</em>, at 2743, which was December 30, 2005.  As of that date, then, <em>no</em> court had jurisdiction to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; the merits of petitioner&#x92;s habeas application.  This repeal of jurisdiction is simply not ambiguous as between pending and future cases.  It prohibits <em>any</em> exercise of jurisdiction, and it became effective as to <em>all</em> cases last December 30.  It is also perfectly clear that the phrase &#x93;no court, <em>justice</em>, or judge&#x94; includes this Court and its Members, and that by exercising our appellate jurisdiction in this case we are &#x93;hear[ing] or consider[ing] &#x2026; an application for a writ of habeas<span class="softbreak"/>corpus.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that statutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases pending at their effective date.  For example, in <em>Bruner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/343/112" class="subref" title="subref">343 U. S. 112</a> (1952)
, we granted certiorari to consider whether the Tucker Act&#x92;s provision denying district court jurisdiction over suits by &#x93;officers&#x94; of the United States barred a suit by an <em>employee</em> of the United States.  After we granted certiorari, Congress amended the Tucker Act by adding suits by &#x93; &#x91;employees&#x92; &#x94; to the provision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 114.  This statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district courts &#x93;became effective&#x94; while the case was pending before us, <em>ibid.</em>, and made no explicit reference to pending cases.  Because the statute &#x93;did not reserve jurisdiction over pending cases,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 115, we held that it clearly ousted jurisdiction over them.  Summarizing centuries of practice, we said: &#x93;This rule&#x97;that, when a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to pending cases, all cases fall with the law&#x97;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 116&#x96;117.  See also <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products</em>,

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>) (&#x93;We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction terminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not, as today&#x92;s opinion for the Court would have it, a judge-made &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11, that we have invented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes.  It is simple recognition of the reality that the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.  <em>And this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To alter this plain meaning, our cases have required an explicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdiction-repealing statute.  For example, <em>Bruner</em>, as mentioned, looked to whether Congress made &#x93;any reservation as to pending cases.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117; see also <em>id.</em>, at 115 (&#x93;Congress made no provision for cases pending at the effective date of the Act withdrawing jurisdiction and, for this reason, Courts of Appeals ordered pending cases terminated for want of jurisdiction&#x94;).  Likewise, in <em>Hallowell</em> v. <em>Commons</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/239/506" class="subref" title="subref">239 U. S. 506</a> (1916)
, Justice Holmes relied on the fact that the jurisdiction-ousting provision &#x93;made no exception for pending litigation, but purported to be universal,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 508.  And in <em>Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Ritchie</em>, 
5Wall.
541 (1867), we again relied on the fact that the jurisdictional repeal was made &#x93;without any saving of such causes as that before us,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 544.  As in <em>Bruner</em>, <em>Hallowell</em>, and <em>Ritchie</em>, the DTA&#x92;s directive that &#x93;no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742, is made &#x93;without any reservation as to pending cases&#x94; and &#x93;purport[s] to be universal.&#x94;  What we stated in an earlier case remains true here: &#x93;[W]hen, if it had been the intention to confine the operation of [the jurisdictional repeal] &#x2026; to cases not pending, it would have been so easy to have said so, we must presume that Congress meant the language employed should have its usual and ordinary signification, and that the old law should be unconditionally repealed.&#x94;  <em>Railroad Co.</em> v. <em>Grant</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    The Court claims that I &#x93;rea[d] too much into&#x94; the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases, <em>ante</em>, at 12, n. 7, and that &#x93;the <em>Bruner</em> rule&#x94; has never been &#x93;an inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19.  But the Court sorely misdescribes <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;as if it were a kind of early-day <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, resolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative inference.  On the contrary, as described above, <em>Bruner</em> stated its holding as an unqualified &#x93;rule,&#x94; which &#x93;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117.  Though <em>Bruner</em> referred to an express savings clause elsewhere in the statute, <em>id.,</em> at 115, n. 7, it disavowed any reliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain meaning, quoting <em>Ritchie</em> at length: &#x93; &#x91;It is quite possible that this effect of the [jurisdiction-stripping statute] was not contemplated by Congress&#x2026; .  [B]ut when terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention.&#x92; &#x94;  343 U. S., at 116 (quoting 5 Wall., at 544&#x96;545).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court also attempts to evade the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases by asserting that &#x93;the &#x91;presumption&#x92; [of application to pending cases] that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption&#x97;viz., the presumption against retroactivity&#x97;in certain limited circumstances.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  I have already explained that what the Court calls a &#x93;presumption&#x94; is simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous meaning of such provisions.  But even taking it to be what the Court says, the effect upon the present case would be the same.  <em>Prospective</em> applications of a statute are &#x93;effective&#x94; upon the statute&#x92;s effective date; that is what an effective-date provision like &#xA7;1005(h)(1) <em>means</em>.<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

            </a>  &#x93; &#x91;[S]hall take effect upon enactment&#x92; is presumed to mean &#x91;shall have prospective effect upon enactment,&#x92; and that presumption is too strong to be overcome by any negative inference [drawn from other provisions of the statute].&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 288 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, concurring in judgments).  The Court&#x92;s &#x93;nonapplication of &#x2026; the presumption against retroactivity&#x94; to &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is thus just another way of stating that the statute takes immediate effect in pending cases.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    Disregarding the plain meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the requirement of explicit exception set forth in the foregoing cases, the Court instead favors &#x93;a negative inference &#x2026; from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 13.  Specifically, it appeals to the fact that &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) are explicitly made applicable to pending cases (by &#xA7;1005(h)(2)).  A negative inference of the sort the Court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an ambiguous provision, but since the meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear, the omitted language in that context would have been redundant.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if &#xA7;1005(e)(1) were at all ambiguous in its application to pending cases, the &#x93;negative inference&#x94; from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) touted by the Court would have no force.  The numerous cases in the <em>Bruner</em> line would at least create a powerful default &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11.  The negative inference urged by the Court would be a particularly awkward and indirect way of rebutting such a longstanding and consistent practice.  This is especially true since the negative inference that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(h)(2)&#x92;s specification that certain provisions <em>shall</em> apply to pending cases is matched by a negative inference in the opposite direction that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(b)(2), which provides that certain provisions shall <em>not </em>apply to pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court&#x92;s reliance on our opinion in <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, is utterly misplaced.  <em>Lindh</em> involved two provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA): a set of amendments to chapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined the scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts; and a provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas statute specially to govern federal collateral review of state capital cases.  See 521 U. S., at 326&#x96;327.  The latter provision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applicable to cases pending at the time of AEDPA&#x92;s enactment; the former made no specific reference to pending cases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 327.  In <em>Lindh</em>, we drew a negative inference from chapter 154&#x92;s explicit reference to pending cases, to conclude that the chapter 153 amendments did <em>not</em> apply in pending cases.  It was essential to our reasoning, however, that both provisions appeared to be <em>identically difficult</em> to classify under our retroactivity cases.  First, we noted that, after <em>Landgraf</em>, there was reason for Congress to suppose that an explicit statement was required to render the amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending cases, because the new chapter 154 &#x93;will have substantive as well as purely procedural effects.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 327.  The next step&#x97;and the critical step&#x97;in our reasoning was that Congress had <em>identical</em> reason to suppose that an explicit statement would be required to apply the chapter 153 amendments to pending cases, but did not provide it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  The negative inference of <em>Lindh</em> rested on the fact that &#x93;[n]othing &#x2026; but a different intent explain[ed] the different treatment.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Here, by contrast, there is ample reason for the different treatment.  The exclusive-review provisions of the DTA, unlike both &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the AEDPA amendments in <em>Lindh</em>, confer <em>new</em> jurisdiction (in the D. C. Circuit)  where there was none before.  For better or for worse, our recent cases have contrasted jurisdiction-<em>creating</em> provisions with jurisdiction-<em>ousting</em> provisions, retaining the venerable rule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied in pending cases, but strongly indicating that the former are typically retroactive.  For example, we stated in <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)
, that a statute &#x93;that <em>creates</em> jurisdiction where none previously existed&#x94; is &#x93;as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other.&#x94;  See also <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>,

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J</span>.); <em>id.</em>, at 722 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy</span>, J., dissenting).  The Court gives our retroactivity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that &#x93;subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents.&#x94;<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            <em>Ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18.  This statement rises to the level of sarcasm when one considers its author&#x92;s description of the governing test of our retroactivity jurisprudence:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The conclusion that a particular rule operates &#x91;retroactively&#x92; comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.  Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.  However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have &#x91;sound &#x2026; instinct[s],&#x92; &#x2026; and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 270 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The only &#x93;familiar consideration,&#x94; &#x93;reasonable reliance,&#x94; and &#x93;settled expectation&#x94; I am aware of pertaining to the present case is the rule of <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;applicable to &#xA7;1005(e)(1), but not to &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)&#x97;which the Court stubbornly disregards.  It is utterly beyond question that &#xA7;1005(e)(2)&#x92;s and (3)&#x92;s application to pending cases (without explicit specification) was not as clear as &#xA7;1005(e)(1)&#x92;s.  That is alone enough to explain the difference in treatment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Another obvious reason for the specification was to stave off any Suspension Clause problems raised by the immediately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by subsection (e)(1).  That is to say, specification of the immediate effectiveness of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) (which, unlike subsection (e)(1), would not fall within the <em>Bruner </em>rule and would not <em>automatically</em> be deemed applicable in pending cases) could reasonably have been thought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas jurisdiction that subsection (e)(1) eliminated in pending cases with an adequate substitute.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These considerations by no means prove that an explicit statement would be <em>required</em> to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable in pending cases.  But they surely gave Congress ample reason to <em>doubt</em> that their application in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the Court glibly assumes.  In any event, even if it were true that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x93; &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18, this would merely establish that subsection (h)(2)&#x92;s reference to pending cases was wholly superfluous when applied to subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3), just as it would have been for subsection (e)(1).  <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference makes sense only when Congress would have perceived &#x93;the wisdom of being explicit&#x94; with respect to the immediate application of <em>both</em> of two statutory provisions, 521 U. S., at 328, but chose to be explicit only for one of them&#x97;not when it would have perceived <em>no need </em>to be explicit for both, but enacted a redundancy only for one.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, it is simply untrue that Congress &#x93; &#x91;should have been just as concerned about&#x92; &#x94; specifying the application of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) to pending cases, <em>ante</em>, at 14 (quoting <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329).  In fact, the negative-inference approach of <em>Lindh</em> is particularly inappropriate in this case, because the negative inference from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) would tend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that <em>are</em> explicitly rendered applicable in pending cases, &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3).  Those provisions purport to vest &#x93;exclusive&#x94; jurisdiction in the D. C. Circuit to consider the claims raised by petitioners here.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.  By drawing a negative inference <em>&lt;fs fs="11.5"&gt;&amp;Agrave;</em>
            <em>la</em>
            <em>Lindh</em>, the Court supplants this exclusive-review mechanism with a dual-review mechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to file applications challenging the CSRTs or military commissions before December 30, 2005.  Whatever the force of <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference in other cases, it surely should not apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision from which the negative inference is drawn.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Worst of all is the Court&#x92;s reliance on the legislative history of the DTA to buttress its implausible reading of &#xA7;1005(e)(1).  We have repeatedly held that such reliance is impermissible where, as here, the statutory language is unambiguous.  But the Court nevertheless relies both on floor statements from the Senate and (quite heavily) on the drafting history of the DTA.  To begin with floor statements: The Court urges that some &#x93;statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to&#x94; the Court&#x92;s interpretation, citing excerpts from the floor debate that support its view, <em>ante</em>, 15&#x96;16, n. 10.  The Court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor statements by the DTA&#x92;s sponsors that flatly contradict its view, because &#x93;those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record <em>after</em> the Senate debate.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Of course this observation, even if true, makes no difference unless one indulges the fantasy that Senate floor speeches are attended (like the Philippics of Demosthenes) by throngs of eager listeners, instead of being delivered (like Demosthenes&#x92; practice sessions on the beach) alone into a vast emptiness.  Whether the floor statements are spoken where no Senator hears, or written where no Senator reads, they represent at most the views of a single Senator.  In any event, the Court greatly exaggerates the one-sidedness of the portions of the floor debate that clearly occurred before the DTA&#x92;s enactment.  Some of the statements of Senator Graham, a sponsor of the bill, only make sense on the assumption that pending cases are covered.<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

            </a>  And at least one opponent of the DTA unmistakably expressed his understanding that it would terminate our jurisdiction in this very case.<a name="ZD-4ref" href="#ZD-4" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    But selectivity is not the greatest vice in the Court&#x92;s use of floor statements to resolve today&#x92;s case.  These statements were made when Members of Congress were fully aware that our continuing jurisdiction <em>over this very case</em> was at issue.  The question was divisive, and floor statements made on both sides were undoubtedly opportunistic and crafted <em>solely</em> for use in the briefs in this very litigation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 151 Cong. Rec. S14257&#x96;S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen. Levin) (arguing against a reading that would &#x93;stri[p] the Federal courts of jurisdiction to consider pending cases, <em>including the Hamdan case now pending in the Supreme Court</em>,&#x94; and urging that <em>Lindh</em> requires the same negative inference that the Court indulges today (emphasis added)).  The Court&#x92;s reliance on such statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar opportunism.  In a virtually identical context, the author of today&#x92;s opinion has written for the Court that &#x93;[t]he legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 262 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).  Likewise, the handful of floor statements that the Court treats as authoritative do not &#x93;reflec[t] any general agreement.&#x94;  They reflect the now-common tactic&#x97;which the Court once again rewards&#x97;of pursuing through floor-speech <em>ipse dixit</em> what could not be achieved through the constitutionally prescribed method of putting language into a bill that a majority of both Houses vote for and the President signs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the floor statements, at least the Court shows some semblance of seemly shame, tucking away its reference to them in a half-hearted footnote.  Not so for its reliance on the DTA&#x92;s drafting history, which is displayed prominently, see <em>ante</em>, at 14&#x96;15.  I have explained elsewhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or reliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute than any other form of legislative history.  This case presents a textbook example of its unreliability.  The Court, <em>ante</em>, at 14, trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the Senate included redundant language, not included in the DTA as passed, reconfirming that the abolition of habeas jurisdiction &#x93;shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.&#x94;  151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005).  But this earlier version of the bill also differed from the DTA in other material respects.  Most notably, it provided for postdecision review by the D. C. Circuit only of the decisions of <em>CSRTs</em>, not military commissions, <em>ibid.; </em>and it limited that review to whether &#x93;the status determination &#x2026; was consistent with the procedures and standards specified by the Secretary of Defense,&#x94; <em>ibid.,</em> not whether &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures &#x2026; is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742.  To say that what moved Senators to reject this earlier bill was the &#x93;action that is pending&#x94; provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even this Court&#x92;s greatest Justices.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>6</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And to think that the House and the President also had this rejection firmly in mind is absurd.  As always&#x97;but <em>especially</em> in the context of strident, partisan legislative conflict of the sort that characterized enactment of this legislation&#x97;the language of the statute that was actually passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President is our only authoritative and only reliable guidepost.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A final but powerful indication of the fact that the Court has made a mess of this statute is the nature of the consequences that ensue.  Though this case concerns a habeas application challenging a trial by military commission, DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(1) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider <em>any</em> &#x93;application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  The vast majority of pending petitions, no doubt, do not relate to military commissions at all, but to more commonly challenged aspects of &#x93;detention&#x94; such as the terms and conditions of confinement.  See <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/466" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 466</a>,

 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  The Solicitor General represents that &#x93;[h]abeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a purported 600 [Guantanamo Bay] detainees,&#x94; including one that &#x93;seek[s] relief on behalf of every Guantanamo detainee who has not already filed an action,&#x94; Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 20, n. 10 (hereinafter Motion to Dismiss).

        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Because I would hold that &#xA7;1005(e)(1) unambiguously terminates the jurisdiction of all courts to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; pending habeas applications, I must confront petitioner&#x92;s arguments that the provision, so interpreted, violates the Suspension Clause.  This claim is easily dispatched.  We stated in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">
Notwithstanding the ill-considered dicta in the Court&#x92;s opinion in <em>Rasul</em>, 542 U.

        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner has made no showing that the postdecision exclusive review by the D. C. Circuit provided in &#xA7;1005(e)(3) is inadequate to test the legality of his trial by military commission.  His principal argument is that the exclusive-review provisions are inadequate because they foreclose review of the claims he raises here.  Though petitioner&#x92;s brief does not parse the statutory language, his argument evidently rests on an erroneously narrow reading of DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  That provision grants the D. C. Circuit authority to review, &#x93;to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.&#x94;  In the quoted text, the phrase &#x93;such standards and procedures&#x94; refers to &#x93;the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (A),&#x94; namely &#x93;Military Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).&#x94;  DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(i), (e)(3)(A), <em>ibid</em>.  This Military Commission Order (Order No. 1) is the Department of Defense&#x92;s fundamental implementing order for the President&#x92;s order authorizing trials by military commission.  Order No. 1 establishes commissions, &#xA7;2; delineates their jurisdiction, &#xA7;3; provides for their officers, &#xA7;4(A); provides for their prosecution and defense counsel, &#xA7;4(B), (C); lays out all their procedures, both pretrial and trial, &#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P), &#xA7;6(A)&#x96;(G); and provides for posttrial military review through the Secretary of Defense and the President, &#xA7;6(H).  In short, the &#x93;standards and procedures specified in&#x94; Order No. 1 include <em>every aspect</em> of the military commissions, including the fact of their existence and every respect in which they differ from courts-martial.  Petitioner&#x92;s claims that the President lacks legal authority to try him before a military commission constitute claims that &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures,&#x94; as specified in Order No. 1, is &#x93;[in]consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  The D. C. Circuit thus retains jurisdiction to consider these claims on postdecision review, and the Government does not dispute that the DTA leaves unaffected our certiorari jurisdiction under

        <p class="bodytext">    Though it does not squarely address the issue, the Court hints ominously that &#x93;the Government&#x92;s preferred reading&#x94; would &#x93;rais[e] grave questions about Congress&#x92; authority to impinge upon this Court&#x92;s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 10&#x96;11 (citing <em>Ex parte Yerger</em>,

It is not clear how there could be any such lurking questions, in light of the aptly named &#x93;<em>Exceptions</em> Clause&#x94; of Article III, &#xA7;2, which, in making our appellate jurisdiction subject to &#x93;such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make,&#x94; explicitly permits exactly what Congress has done here.  But any doubt our prior cases might have created on this score is surely chimerical in <em>this</em> case.  As just noted, the exclusive-review provisions provide a substitute for habeas review adequate to satisfy the Suspension Clause, which <em>forbids</em> the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.  <em>A fortiori</em> they provide a substitute adequate to satisfy any implied substantive limitations, whether real or imaginary, upon the Exceptions Clause, which <em>authorizes</em> such exceptions as &#xA7;1005(e)(1).</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if Congress had not clearly and constitutionally eliminated jurisdiction over this case, neither this Court nor the lower courts ought to exercise it.  Traditionally, equitable principles govern both the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and the granting of the injunctive relief sought by petitioner.  See <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">311</a> (1982)
.  In light of Congress&#x92;s provision of an alternate avenue for petitioner&#x92;s claims in &#xA7;1005(e)(3), those equitable principles counsel that we abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In requesting abstention, the Government relies principally on <em>Councilman</em>, in which we abstained from considering a serviceman&#x92;s claim that his charge for marijuana possession was not sufficiently &#x93;service-connected&#x94; to trigger the subject-matter jurisdiction of the military courts-martial.  See 420 U. S., at 740, 758.  Admittedly, <em>Councilman</em> does not squarely control petitioner&#x92;s case, but it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence.  As the Court describes, <em>ante</em>, at 21, <em>Councilman</em> &#x93;identifie[d] two considerations of comity that together favor[ed] abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings against service personnel.&#x94;  But the Court errs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this case.  Both of them, and a third consideration not emphasized in <em>Councilman</em>, all cut in favor of abstention here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, the Court observes that <em>Councilman</em> rested in part on the fact that &#x93;military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts,&#x94; and concludes that &#x93;Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  This is true enough.  But for some reason, the Court fails to make any inquiry into whether military commission trials might involve <em>other</em> &#x93;military necessities&#x94; or &#x93;unique military exigencies,&#x94; 420 U. S., at 757, comparable in gravity to those at stake in <em>Councilman</em>.  To put this in context: The charge against the respondent in <em>Councilman</em> was the off-base possession and sale of marijuana while he was stationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, see <em>id.,</em> at 739&#x96;740.  The charge against the petitioner here is joining and actively abetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thousands of innocent American civilians without warning on September 11, 2001.  While <em>Councilman</em> held that the prosecution of the former charge involved &#x93;military necessities&#x94; counseling against our interference, the Court <em>does not even ponder the same question</em> for the latter charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The reason for the Court&#x92;s &#x93;blinkered study&#x94; of this question, <em>ante</em>, at 19, is not hard to fathom.  The principal opinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe that the trials by military commission involve any &#x93;military necessity&#x94; <em>at all:</em> &#x93;The charge&#x92;s shortcomings &#x2026; are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition &#x2026; for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 48.  This is quite at odds with the views on this subject expressed by our political branches.  Because of &#x93;military necessity,&#x94; a joint session of Congress authorized the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force,&#x94; including military commissions, &#x93;against those nations, organizations, or persons [such as petitioner] he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force, &#xA7;2(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224, note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1541.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. &#xA7;1541</a> (2000 ed., Supp. III).  In keeping with this authority, the President has determined that &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order &#x2026; to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 2001, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e) (2002).  It is not clear where the Court derives the authority&#x97;or the audacity&#x97;to contradict this determination.  If &#x93;military necessities&#x94; relating to &#x93;duty&#x94; and &#x93;discipline&#x94; required abstention in <em>Councilman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 757, military necessities relating to the disabling, deterrence, and punishment of the mass-murdering terrorists of September 11 require abstention all the more here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court further seeks to distinguish <em>Councilman</em> on the ground that &#x93;the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  To be sure, <em>Councilman</em> emphasized that &#x93;Congress created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion, who would gain over time thorough familiarity with military problems.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 758 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).  The Court contrasts this &#x93;integrated system&#x94; insulated from military influence with the review scheme established by Order No. 1, which &#x93;provides that appeal of a review panel&#x92;s decision may be had only to the Secretary of Defense himself, &#xA7;6(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, &#xA7;6(H)(6).&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if we were to accept the Court&#x92;s extraordinary assumption that the President &#x93;lack[s] the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 23,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

            </a> the Court&#x92;s description of the review scheme here is anachronistic.  As of December 30, 2005, the &#x93;fina[l]&#x94; review of decisions by military commissions is now conducted by the D. C. Circuit pursuant to &#xA7;1005(e)(3) of the DTA, and by this Court under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1254.html#1" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;1254(1)</a>.  This provision for review by Article III courts creates, if anything, a review scheme <em>more</em> insulated from Executive control than that in <em>Councilman</em>.<a name="ZD-9ref" href="#ZD-9" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>9</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  At the time we decided <em>Councilman</em>, Congress had not &#x93;conferred on any Art[icle] III court jurisdiction directly to review court-martial determinations.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 746.  The final arbiter of direct appeals was the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), an Article I court whose members possessed neither life tenure, nor salary protection, nor the constitutional protection from removal provided to federal judges in Article III, &#xA7;1.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/867.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;867(a)(2)</a> (1970 ed.).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Moreover, a third consideration counsels strongly in favor of abstention in this case.  <em>Councilman</em> reasoned that the &#x93;considerations of comity, the necessity of respect for coordinate judicial systems&#x94; that motivated our decision in <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
, were inapplicable to courts-martial, because &#x93;the particular demands of federalism are not implicated.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 756, 757.  Though military commissions likewise do not implicate &#x93;the particular demands of federalism,&#x94; considerations of <em>interbranch</em> comity at the federal level weigh heavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case.  Here, apparently for the first time in history, see Motion to Dismiss 6, a District Court enjoined ongoing military commission proceedings, which had been deemed &#x93;necessary&#x94; by the President &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e).  Such an order brings the Judicial Branch into direct conflict with the Executive in an area where the Executive&#x92;s competence is maximal and ours is virtually nonexistent.  We should exercise our equitable discretion to <em>avoid</em> such conflict.  Instead, the Court rushes headlong to meet it.  Elsewhere, we have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state courts have &#x93;the first opportunity to review&#x94; a petitioner&#x92;s claim, merely to &#x93;reduc[e] friction between the state and federal court systems.&#x94;  <em>O&#x92;Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/526/838" class="subref" title="subref">526 U. S. 838</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">844</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">845</a> (1999)
.  The &#x93;friction&#x94; created today between this Court and the Executive Branch is many times more serious.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the face of such concerns, the Court relies heavily on <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/1" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 1</a> (1942)
: &#x93;Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, [in <em>Quirin</em>] we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  It is likely that the Government in <em>Quirin</em>, unlike here, preferred a hasty resolution of the case in this Court, so that it could swiftly execute the sentences imposed, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/507" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 507</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">569</a> (2004)
 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J</span>., dissenting).  But the Court&#x92;s reliance on <em>Quirin</em> suffers from a more fundamental defect: Once again, it ignores the DTA, which creates an avenue for the consideration of petitioner&#x92;s claims that did not exist at the time of <em>Quirin</em>.  Collateral application for habeas review was the <em>only</em> vehicle available.  And there was no compelling reason to postpone consideration of the <em>Quirin</em> application until the termination of military proceedings, because the only cognizable claims presented were general challenges to the authority of the commissions that would not be affected by the specific proceedings.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8&#x96;9, n. 2.  In the DTA, by contrast, Congress has expanded the scope of Article III review and has channeled it exclusively through a single, postverdict appeal to Article III courts.  Because Congress has created a novel unitary scheme of Article III review of military commissions that was absent in 1942, <em>Quirin</em> is no longer governing precedent.</p>

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-1" href="#ZD-1ref">1</a> The Court apparently believes that the effective-date provision means nothing at all.  &#x93;That paragraph (1), along with paragraphs (2) and (3), is to &#x91;take effect on the date of enactment,&#x92; DTA &#xA7;1005(h)(1),

, to the effect that &#x93;a statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.&#x94;  Ante, at 14, n. 9 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).  But this quote merely restates the obvious: An effective-date provision does not render a statute applicable to &#x93;conduct that occurred at an earlier date,&#x94; but of course it renders the statute applicable to conduct that occurs on the effective date and all future dates&#x97;such as the Court&#x92;s exercise of jurisdiction here.  The Court seems to suggest that, because the effective-date provision does not authorize retroactive application, it also fails to authorize prospective application (and is thus useless verbiage).  This cannot be true.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-2" href="#ZD-2ref">2</a> A comparison with Lindh v. Murphy, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, shows this not to be true.  Subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) of &#xA7;1005 resemble the provisions of AEDPA at issue in Lindh (whose retroactivityas applied to pending cases the Lindh majority did not rule upon,see 521 U. S., at 326), in that they &#x93;g[o] beyond &#x91;mere&#x92; procedure,&#x94;id., at 327.  They impose novel and unprecedented disabilities onthe Executive Branch in its conduct of military affairs.  Subsection (e)(2) imposes judicial review on the Combatant Status ReviewTribunals (CSRTs), whose implementing order did not subject themto review by Article III courts. See Memorandum from Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz re: Order Establishing Com-batant Status Review Tribunals, at 3 &#xA7;h (July 7, 2004), avail-able at http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040707review.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 27, 2006, and availablein Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743. Historically, federal courts have never reviewed the validity of the final decision of any military commission; their jurisdiction has been restricted to considering the commission&#x92;s &#x93;lawful authority to hear, decide and condemn,&#x94;  In re Yamashita, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/1" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 1</a>,

.  Thus, contrary to the Court&#x92;s suggestion, ante, at 17, subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) confer new jurisdiction: They impose judicial oversight on a traditionally unreviewable exercise of military authority by the Commander in Chief.

The fact that Article III review is discretionary does not mean that it lacks &#x93;structural insulation from military influence,&#x94; ante, at 23, and its discretionary nature presents no obstacle to the courts&#x92; future review these cases.


The Court might more cogently have relied on the discretionary nature of review to argue that the statute provides an inadequate substitute for habeas review under the Suspension Clause.  See supra, at 16&#x96;18.  But this argument would have no force, even if all appeals to the D. C. Circuit were discretionary.  The exercise of habeas jurisdiction has traditionally been entirely a matter of the court&#x92;s equitable discretion, see Withrow v. Williams, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/507/680" class="subref" title="subref">507 U. S. 680</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">715</a>&#x96;718 (1993)
 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), so the fact that habeas jurisdiction is replaced by discretionary appellate review does not render the substitution &#x93;inadequate.&#x94;  Swain, 430 U. S., at 381.

        <p class="bodytext">    On December 30, 2005, Congress enacted the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA).  It unambiguously provides that, as of that date, &#x93;no court, justice, or judge&#x94; shall have jurisdiction to consider the habeas application of a Guantanamo Bay detainee.  Notwithstanding this plain directive, the Court today concludes that, on what it calls the statute&#x92;s <em>most natural</em> reading, <em>every</em> &#x93;court, justice, or judge&#x94; before whom such a habeas application was pending on December 30 has jurisdiction to hear, consider, and render judgment on it.  This conclusion is patently erroneous.  And even if it were not, the jurisdiction supposedly retained should, in an exercise of sound equitable discretion, not be exercised.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    The DTA provides: &#x93;[N]o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  &#xA7;1005(e)(1),

2742 (internal division omitted).  This provision &#x93;t[ook] effect on the date of the enactment of this Act,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(h)(1), <em>id.</em>, at 2743, which was December 30, 2005.  As of that date, then, <em>no</em> court had jurisdiction to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; the merits of petitioner&#x92;s habeas application.  This repeal of jurisdiction is simply not ambiguous as between pending and future cases.  It prohibits <em>any</em> exercise of jurisdiction, and it became effective as to <em>all</em> cases last December 30.  It is also perfectly clear that the phrase &#x93;no court, <em>justice</em>, or judge&#x94; includes this Court and its Members, and that by exercising our appellate jurisdiction in this case we are &#x93;hear[ing] or consider[ing] &#x2026; an application for a writ of habeas<span class="softbreak"/>corpus.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that statutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases pending at their effective date.  For example, in <em>Bruner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/343/112" class="subref" title="subref">343 U. S. 112</a> (1952)
, we granted certiorari to consider whether the Tucker Act&#x92;s provision denying district court jurisdiction over suits by &#x93;officers&#x94; of the United States barred a suit by an <em>employee</em> of the United States.  After we granted certiorari, Congress amended the Tucker Act by adding suits by &#x93; &#x91;employees&#x92; &#x94; to the provision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 114.  This statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district courts &#x93;became effective&#x94; while the case was pending before us, <em>ibid.</em>, and made no explicit reference to pending cases.  Because the statute &#x93;did not reserve jurisdiction over pending cases,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 115, we held that it clearly ousted jurisdiction over them.  Summarizing centuries of practice, we said: &#x93;This rule&#x97;that, when a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to pending cases, all cases fall with the law&#x97;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 116&#x96;117.

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>) (&#x93;We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction terminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not, as today&#x92;s opinion for the Court would have it, a judge-made &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11, that we have invented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes.  It is simple recognition of the reality that the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.  <em>And this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To alter this plain meaning, our cases have required an explicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdiction-repealing statute.  For example, <em>Bruner</em>, as mentioned, looked to whether Congress made &#x93;any reservation as to pending cases.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117; see also <em>id.</em>, at 115 (&#x93;Congress made no provision for cases pending at the effective date of the Act withdrawing jurisdiction and, for this reason, Courts of Appeals ordered pending cases terminated for want of jurisdiction&#x94;).  Likewise, in <em>Hallowell</em> v. <em>Commons</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/239/506" class="subref" title="subref">239 U. S. 506</a> (1916)
, Justice Holmes relied on the fact that the jurisdiction-ousting provision &#x93;made no exception for pending litigation, but purported to be universal,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 508.  And in <em>Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Ritchie</em>, 
5Wall.
541 (1867), we again relied on the fact that the jurisdictional repeal was made &#x93;without any saving of such causes as that before us,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 544.  As in <em>Bruner</em>, <em>Hallowell</em>, and <em>Ritchie</em>, the DTA&#x92;s directive that &#x93;no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742, is made &#x93;without any reservation as to pending cases&#x94; and &#x93;purport[s] to be universal.&#x94;  What we stated in an earlier case remains true here: &#x93;[W]hen, if it had been the intention to confine the operation of [the jurisdictional repeal] &#x2026; to cases not pending, it would have been so easy to have said so, we must presume that Congress meant the language employed should have its usual and ordinary signification, and that the old law should be unconditionally repealed.&#x94;  <em>Railroad Co.</em> v. <em>Grant</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    The Court claims that I &#x93;rea[d] too much into&#x94; the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases, <em>ante</em>, at 12, n. 7, and that &#x93;the <em>Bruner</em> rule&#x94; has never been &#x93;an inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19.  But the Court sorely misdescribes <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;as if it were a kind of early-day <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, resolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative inference.  On the contrary, as described above, <em>Bruner</em> stated its holding as an unqualified &#x93;rule,&#x94; which &#x93;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117.  Though <em>Bruner</em> referred to an express savings clause elsewhere in the statute, <em>id.,</em> at 115, n. 7, it disavowed any reliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain meaning, quoting <em>Ritchie</em> at length: &#x93; &#x91;It is quite possible that this effect of the [jurisdiction-stripping statute] was not contemplated by Congress&#x2026; .  [B]ut when terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention.&#x92; &#x94;  343 U. S., at 116 (quoting 5 Wall., at 544&#x96;545).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court also attempts to evade the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases by asserting that &#x93;the &#x91;presumption&#x92; [of application to pending cases] that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption&#x97;viz., the presumption against retroactivity&#x97;in certain limited circumstances.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  I have already explained that what the Court calls a &#x93;presumption&#x94; is simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous meaning of such provisions.  But even taking it to be what the Court says, the effect upon the present case would be the same.  <em>Prospective</em> applications of a statute are &#x93;effective&#x94; upon the statute&#x92;s effective date; that is what an effective-date provision like &#xA7;1005(h)(1) <em>means</em>.<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

            </a>  &#x93; &#x91;[S]hall take effect upon enactment&#x92; is presumed to mean &#x91;shall have prospective effect upon enactment,&#x92; and that presumption is too strong to be overcome by any negative inference [drawn from other provisions of the statute].&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 288 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, concurring in judgments).  The Court&#x92;s &#x93;nonapplication of &#x2026; the presumption against retroactivity&#x94; to &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is thus just another way of stating that the statute takes immediate effect in pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Though the Court resists the <em>Bruner</em> rule, it cannot cite a<em> single case</em> in the history of Anglo-American law (before today) in which a jurisdiction-stripping provision was denied immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation.  By contrast, the cases granting such immediate effect are legion, and they repeatedly rely on the plain language of the jurisdictional repeal as an &#x93;inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19, by requiring an express reservation to save pending cases.

        <p class="bodytext">    Disregarding the plain meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the requirement of explicit exception set forth in the foregoing cases, the Court instead favors &#x93;a negative inference &#x2026; from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 13.  Specifically, it appeals to the fact that &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) are explicitly made applicable to pending cases (by &#xA7;1005(h)(2)).  A negative inference of the sort the Court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an ambiguous provision, but since the meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear, the omitted language in that context would have been redundant.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if &#xA7;1005(e)(1) were at all ambiguous in its application to pending cases, the &#x93;negative inference&#x94; from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) touted by the Court would have no force.  The numerous cases in the <em>Bruner</em> line would at least create a powerful default &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11.  The negative inference urged by the Court would be a particularly awkward and indirect way of rebutting such a longstanding and consistent practice.  This is especially true since the negative inference that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(h)(2)&#x92;s specification that certain provisions <em>shall</em> apply to pending cases is matched by a negative inference in the opposite direction that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(b)(2), which provides that certain provisions shall <em>not </em>apply to pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court&#x92;s reliance on our opinion in <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, is utterly misplaced.  <em>Lindh</em> involved two provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA): a set of amendments to chapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined the scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts; and a provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas statute specially to govern federal collateral review of state capital cases.  See 521 U. S., at 326&#x96;327.  The latter provision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applicable to cases pending at the time of AEDPA&#x92;s enactment; the former made no specific reference to pending cases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 327.  In <em>Lindh</em>, we drew a negative inference from chapter 154&#x92;s explicit reference to pending cases, to conclude that the chapter 153 amendments did <em>not</em> apply in pending cases.  It was essential to our reasoning, however, that both provisions appeared to be <em>identically difficult</em> to classify under our retroactivity cases.  First, we noted that, after <em>Landgraf</em>, there was reason for Congress to suppose that an explicit statement was required to render the amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending cases, because the new chapter 154 &#x93;will have substantive as well as purely procedural effects.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 327.  The next step&#x97;and the critical step&#x97;in our reasoning was that Congress had <em>identical</em> reason to suppose that an explicit statement would be required to apply the chapter 153 amendments to pending cases, but did not provide it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  The negative inference of <em>Lindh</em> rested on the fact that &#x93;[n]othing &#x2026; but a different intent explain[ed] the different treatment.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Here, by contrast, there is ample reason for the different treatment.  The exclusive-review provisions of the DTA, unlike both &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the AEDPA amendments in <em>Lindh</em>, confer <em>new</em> jurisdiction (in the D. C. Circuit)  where there was none before.  For better or for worse, our recent cases have contrasted jurisdiction-<em>creating</em> provisions with jurisdiction-<em>ousting</em> provisions, retaining the venerable rule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied in pending cases, but strongly indicating that the former are typically retroactive.  For example, we stated in <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)
, that a statute &#x93;that <em>creates</em> jurisdiction where none previously existed&#x94; is &#x93;as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other.&#x94;  See also <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>,

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J</span>.); <em>id.</em>, at 722 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy</span>, J., dissenting).  The Court gives our retroactivity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that &#x93;subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents.&#x94;<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            <em>Ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18.  This statement rises to the level of sarcasm when one considers its author&#x92;s description of the governing test of our retroactivity jurisprudence:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The conclusion that a particular rule operates &#x91;retroactively&#x92; comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.  Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.  However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have &#x91;sound &#x2026; instinct[s],&#x92; &#x2026; and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 270 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The only &#x93;familiar consideration,&#x94; &#x93;reasonable reliance,&#x94; and &#x93;settled expectation&#x94; I am aware of pertaining to the present case is the rule of <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;applicable to &#xA7;1005(e)(1), but not to &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)&#x97;which the Court stubbornly disregards.  It is utterly beyond question that &#xA7;1005(e)(2)&#x92;s and (3)&#x92;s application to pending cases (without explicit specification) was not as clear as &#xA7;1005(e)(1)&#x92;s.  That is alone enough to explain the difference in treatment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Another obvious reason for the specification was to stave off any Suspension Clause problems raised by the immediately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by subsection (e)(1).  That is to say, specification of the immediate effectiveness of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) (which, unlike subsection (e)(1), would not fall within the <em>Bruner </em>rule and would not <em>automatically</em> be deemed applicable in pending cases) could reasonably have been thought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas jurisdiction that subsection (e)(1) eliminated in pending cases with an adequate substitute.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These considerations by no means prove that an explicit statement would be <em>required</em> to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable in pending cases.  But they surely gave Congress ample reason to <em>doubt</em> that their application in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the Court glibly assumes.  In any event, even if it were true that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x93; &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18, this would merely establish that subsection (h)(2)&#x92;s reference to pending cases was wholly superfluous when applied to subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3), just as it would have been for subsection (e)(1).  <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference makes sense only when Congress would have perceived &#x93;the wisdom of being explicit&#x94; with respect to the immediate application of <em>both</em> of two statutory provisions, 521 U. S., at 328, but chose to be explicit only for one of them&#x97;not when it would have perceived <em>no need </em>to be explicit for both, but enacted a redundancy only for one.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, it is simply untrue that Congress &#x93; &#x91;should have been just as concerned about&#x92; &#x94; specifying the application of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) to pending cases, <em>ante</em>, at 14 (quoting <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329).  In fact, the negative-inference approach of <em>Lindh</em> is particularly inappropriate in this case, because the negative inference from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) would tend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that <em>are</em> explicitly rendered applicable in pending cases, &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3).  Those provisions purport to vest &#x93;exclusive&#x94; jurisdiction in the D. C. Circuit to consider the claims raised by petitioners here.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.  By drawing a negative inference <em>&lt;fs fs="11.5"&gt;&amp;Agrave;</em>
            <em>la</em>
            <em>Lindh</em>, the Court supplants this exclusive-review mechanism with a dual-review mechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to file applications challenging the CSRTs or military commissions before December 30, 2005.  Whatever the force of <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference in other cases, it surely should not apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision from which the negative inference is drawn.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Worst of all is the Court&#x92;s reliance on the legislative history of the DTA to buttress its implausible reading of &#xA7;1005(e)(1).  We have repeatedly held that such reliance is impermissible where, as here, the statutory language is unambiguous.  But the Court nevertheless relies both on floor statements from the Senate and (quite heavily) on the drafting history of the DTA.  To begin with floor statements: The Court urges that some &#x93;statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to&#x94; the Court&#x92;s interpretation, citing excerpts from the floor debate that support its view, <em>ante</em>, 15&#x96;16, n. 10.  The Court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor statements by the DTA&#x92;s sponsors that flatly contradict its view, because &#x93;those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record <em>after</em> the Senate debate.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Of course this observation, even if true, makes no difference unless one indulges the fantasy that Senate floor speeches are attended (like the Philippics of Demosthenes) by throngs of eager listeners, instead of being delivered (like Demosthenes&#x92; practice sessions on the beach) alone into a vast emptiness.  Whether the floor statements are spoken where no Senator hears, or written where no Senator reads, they represent at most the views of a single Senator.  In any event, the Court greatly exaggerates the one-sidedness of the portions of the floor debate that clearly occurred before the DTA&#x92;s enactment.  Some of the statements of Senator Graham, a sponsor of the bill, only make sense on the assumption that pending cases are covered.<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    But selectivity is not the greatest vice in the Court&#x92;s use of floor statements to resolve today&#x92;s case.  These statements were made when Members of Congress were fully aware that our continuing jurisdiction <em>over this very case</em> was at issue.  The question was divisive, and floor statements made on both sides were undoubtedly opportunistic and crafted <em>solely</em> for use in the briefs in this very litigation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 151 Cong. Rec. S14257&#x96;S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen. Levin) (arguing against a reading that would &#x93;stri[p] the Federal courts of jurisdiction to consider pending cases, <em>including the Hamdan case now pending in the Supreme Court</em>,&#x94; and urging that <em>Lindh</em> requires the same negative inference that the Court indulges today (emphasis added)).  The Court&#x92;s reliance on such statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar opportunism.  In a virtually identical context, the author of today&#x92;s opinion has written for the Court that &#x93;[t]he legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 262 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).  Likewise, the handful of floor statements that the Court treats as authoritative do not &#x93;reflec[t] any general agreement.&#x94;  They reflect the now-common tactic&#x97;which the Court once again rewards&#x97;of pursuing through floor-speech <em>ipse dixit</em> what could not be achieved through the constitutionally prescribed method of putting language into a bill that a majority of both Houses vote for and the President signs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the floor statements, at least the Court shows some semblance of seemly shame, tucking away its reference to them in a half-hearted footnote.  Not so for its reliance on the DTA&#x92;s drafting history, which is displayed prominently, see <em>ante</em>, at 14&#x96;15.  I have explained elsewhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or reliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute than any other form of legislative history.  This case presents a textbook example of its unreliability.  The Court, <em>ante</em>, at 14, trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the Senate included redundant language, not included in the DTA as passed, reconfirming that the abolition of habeas jurisdiction &#x93;shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.&#x94;  151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005).  But this earlier version of the bill also differed from the DTA in other material respects.  Most notably, it provided for postdecision review by the D. C. Circuit only of the decisions of <em>CSRTs</em>, not military commissions, <em>ibid.; </em>and it limited that review to whether &#x93;the status determination &#x2026; was consistent with the procedures and standards specified by the Secretary of Defense,&#x94; <em>ibid.,</em> not whether &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures &#x2026; is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742.  To say that what moved Senators to reject this earlier bill was the &#x93;action that is pending&#x94; provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even this Court&#x92;s greatest Justices.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  And to think that the House and the President also had this rejection firmly in mind is absurd.  As always&#x97;but <em>especially</em> in the context of strident, partisan legislative conflict of the sort that characterized enactment of this legislation&#x97;the language of the statute that was actually passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President is our only authoritative and only reliable guidepost.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A final but powerful indication of the fact that the Court has made a mess of this statute is the nature of the consequences that ensue.  Though this case concerns a habeas application challenging a trial by military commission, DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(1) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider <em>any</em> &#x93;application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  The vast majority of pending petitions, no doubt, do not relate to military commissions at all, but to more commonly challenged aspects of &#x93;detention&#x94; such as the terms and conditions of confinement.  See <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/466" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 466</a>,

 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  The Solicitor General represents that &#x93;[h]abeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a purported 600 [Guantanamo Bay] detainees,&#x94; including one that &#x93;seek[s] relief on behalf of every Guantanamo detainee who has not already filed an action,&#x94; Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 20, n. 10 (hereinafter Motion to Dismiss).  The Court&#x92;s interpretation transforms a provision abolishing jurisdiction over <em>all</em> Guantanamo-related habeas petitions into a provision that retains jurisdiction over cases sufficiently numerous to keep the courts busy for years to come.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Because I would hold that &#xA7;1005(e)(1) unambiguously terminates the jurisdiction of all courts to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; pending habeas applications, I must confront petitioner&#x92;s arguments that the provision, so interpreted, violates the Suspension Clause.  This claim is easily dispatched.  We stated in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager</em>,

:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;We are cited to no instance where a court, in this or any other country where the writ is known, has issued it on behalf of an alien enemy who, at no relevant time and in no stage of his captivity, has been within its territorial jurisdiction.  Nothing in the text of the Constitution extends such a right, nor does anything in our statutes.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Notwithstanding the ill-considered dicta in the Court&#x92;s opinion in <em>Rasul</em>, 542 U. S., at 480&#x96;481, it is clear that Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is outside the sovereign &#x93;territorial jurisdiction&#x94; of the United States.  See <em>id.</em>, at 500&#x96;505 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  Petitioner, an enemy alien detained abroad, has no rights under the Suspension Clause.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But even if petitioner were fully protected by the Clause, the DTA would create no suspension problem.  This Court has repeatedly acknowledged that &#x93;the substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person&#x92;s detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.&#x94;  <em>Swain</em> v. <em>Pressley</em>,

 (&#x93;Congress could, without raising any constitutional questions, provide an adequate substitute through the courts of appeals&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner has made no showing that the postdecision exclusive review by the D. C. Circuit provided in &#xA7;1005(e)(3) is inadequate to test the legality of his trial by military commission.  His principal argument is that the exclusive-review provisions are inadequate because they foreclose review of the claims he raises here.  Though petitioner&#x92;s brief does not parse the statutory language, his argument evidently rests on an erroneously narrow reading of DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  That provision grants the D. C. Circuit authority to review, &#x93;to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.&#x94;  In the quoted text, the phrase &#x93;such standards and procedures&#x94; refers to &#x93;the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (A),&#x94; namely &#x93;Military Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).&#x94;  DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(i), (e)(3)(A), <em>ibid</em>.  This Military Commission Order (Order No. 1) is the Department of Defense&#x92;s fundamental implementing order for the President&#x92;s order authorizing trials by military commission.  Order No. 1 establishes commissions, &#xA7;2; delineates their jurisdiction, &#xA7;3; provides for their officers, &#xA7;4(A); provides for their prosecution and defense counsel, &#xA7;4(B), (C); lays out all their procedures, both pretrial and trial, &#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P), &#xA7;6(A)&#x96;(G); and provides for posttrial military review through the Secretary of Defense and the President, &#xA7;6(H).  In short, the &#x93;standards and procedures specified in&#x94; Order No. 1 include <em>every aspect</em> of the military commissions, including the fact of their existence and every respect in which they differ from courts-martial.  Petitioner&#x92;s claims that the President lacks legal authority to try him before a military commission constitute claims that &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures,&#x94; as specified in Order No. 1, is &#x93;[in]consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  The D. C. Circuit thus retains jurisdiction to consider these claims on postdecision review, and the Government does not dispute that the DTA leaves unaffected our certiorari jurisdiction under

Thus, the DTA merely <em>defers</em> our jurisdiction to consider petitioner&#x92;s claims; it does not eliminate that jurisdiction.  It constitutes neither an &#x93;inadequate&#x94; nor an &#x93;ineffective&#x94; substitute for petitioner&#x92;s pending habeas application.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Though it does not squarely address the issue, the Court hints ominously that &#x93;the Government&#x92;s preferred reading&#x94; would &#x93;rais[e] grave questions about Congress&#x92; authority to impinge upon this Court&#x92;s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 10&#x96;11 (citing <em>Ex parte Yerger</em>, 
8Wall.
85 (1869); <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin</em>,

It is not clear how there could be any such lurking questions, in light of the aptly named &#x93;<em>Exceptions</em> Clause&#x94; of Article III, &#xA7;2, which, in making our appellate jurisdiction subject to &#x93;such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make,&#x94; explicitly permits exactly what Congress has done here.  But any doubt our prior cases might have created on this score is surely chimerical in <em>this</em> case.  As just noted, the exclusive-review provisions provide a substitute for habeas review adequate to satisfy the Suspension Clause, which <em>forbids</em> the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.  <em>A fortiori</em> they provide a substitute adequate to satisfy any implied substantive limitations, whether real or imaginary, upon the Exceptions Clause, which <em>authorizes</em> such exceptions as &#xA7;1005(e)(1).</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if Congress had not clearly and constitutionally eliminated jurisdiction over this case, neither this Court nor the lower courts ought to exercise it.  Traditionally, equitable principles govern both the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and the granting of the injunctive relief sought by petitioner.  See <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a>,

.  In light of Congress&#x92;s provision of an alternate avenue for petitioner&#x92;s claims in &#xA7;1005(e)(3), those equitable principles counsel that we abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In requesting abstention, the Government relies principally on <em>Councilman</em>, in which we abstained from considering a serviceman&#x92;s claim that his charge for marijuana possession was not sufficiently &#x93;service-connected&#x94; to trigger the subject-matter jurisdiction of the military courts-martial.  See 420 U. S., at 740, 758.  Admittedly, <em>Councilman</em> does not squarely control petitioner&#x92;s case, but it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence.  As the Court describes, <em>ante</em>, at 21, <em>Councilman</em> &#x93;identifie[d] two considerations of comity that together favor[ed] abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings against service personnel.&#x94;  But the Court errs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this case.  Both of them, and a third consideration not emphasized in <em>Councilman</em>, all cut in favor of abstention here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, the Court observes that <em>Councilman</em> rested in part on the fact that &#x93;military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts,&#x94; and concludes that &#x93;Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  This is true enough.  But for some reason, the Court fails to make any inquiry into whether military commission trials might involve <em>other</em> &#x93;military necessities&#x94; or &#x93;unique military exigencies,&#x94; 420 U. S., at 757, comparable in gravity to those at stake in <em>Councilman</em>.  To put this in context: The charge against the respondent in <em>Councilman</em> was the off-base possession and sale of marijuana while he was stationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, see <em>id.,</em> at 739&#x96;740.  The charge against the petitioner here is joining and actively abetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thousands of innocent American civilians without warning on September 11, 2001.  While <em>Councilman</em> held that the prosecution of the former charge involved &#x93;military necessities&#x94; counseling against our interference, the Court <em>does not even ponder the same question</em> for the latter charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The reason for the Court&#x92;s &#x93;blinkered study&#x94; of this question, <em>ante</em>, at 19, is not hard to fathom.  The principal opinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe that the trials by military commission involve any &#x93;military necessity&#x94; <em>at all:</em> &#x93;The charge&#x92;s shortcomings &#x2026; are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition &#x2026; for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 48.  This is quite at odds with the views on this subject expressed by our political branches.  Because of &#x93;military necessity,&#x94; a joint session of Congress authorized the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force,&#x94; including military commissions, &#x93;against those nations, organizations, or persons [such as petitioner] he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force, &#xA7;2(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224, note following

In keeping with this authority, the President has determined that &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order &#x2026; to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 2001, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e) (2002).  It is not clear where the Court derives the authority&#x97;or the audacity&#x97;to contradict this determination.  If &#x93;military necessities&#x94; relating to &#x93;duty&#x94; and &#x93;discipline&#x94; required abstention in <em>Councilman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 757, military necessities relating to the disabling, deterrence, and punishment of the mass-murdering terrorists of September 11 require abstention all the more here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court further seeks to distinguish <em>Councilman</em> on the ground that &#x93;the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  To be sure, <em>Councilman</em> emphasized that &#x93;Congress created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion, who would gain over time thorough familiarity with military problems.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 758 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).  The Court contrasts this &#x93;integrated system&#x94; insulated from military influence with the review scheme established by Order No. 1, which &#x93;provides that appeal of a review panel&#x92;s decision may be had only to the Secretary of Defense himself, &#xA7;6(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, &#xA7;6(H)(6).&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if we were to accept the Court&#x92;s extraordinary assumption that the President &#x93;lack[s] the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 23,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

            </a>  At the time we decided <em>Councilman</em>, Congress had not &#x93;conferred on any Art[icle] III court jurisdiction directly to review court-martial determinations.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 746.  The final arbiter of direct appeals was the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), an Article I court whose members possessed neither life tenure, nor salary protection, nor the constitutional protection from removal provided to federal judges in Article III, &#xA7;1.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/867.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;867(a)(2)</a> (1970 ed.).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Moreover, a third consideration counsels strongly in favor of abstention in this case.  <em>Councilman</em> reasoned that the &#x93;considerations of comity, the necessity of respect for coordinate judicial systems&#x94; that motivated our decision in <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
, were inapplicable to courts-martial, because &#x93;the particular demands of federalism are not implicated.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 756, 757.  Though military commissions likewise do not implicate &#x93;the particular demands of federalism,&#x94; considerations of <em>interbranch</em> comity at the federal level weigh heavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case.  Here, apparently for the first time in history, see Motion to Dismiss 6, a District Court enjoined ongoing military commission proceedings, which had been deemed &#x93;necessary&#x94; by the President &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e).  Such an order brings the Judicial Branch into direct conflict with the Executive in an area where the Executive&#x92;s competence is maximal and ours is virtually nonexistent.  We should exercise our equitable discretion to <em>avoid</em> such conflict.  Instead, the Court rushes headlong to meet it.  Elsewhere, we have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state courts have &#x93;the first opportunity to review&#x94; a petitioner&#x92;s claim, merely to &#x93;reduc[e] friction between the state and federal court systems.&#x94;  <em>O&#x92;Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>,

 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J</span>., dissenting).  But the Court&#x92;s reliance on <em>Quirin</em> suffers from a more fundamental defect: Once again, it ignores the DTA, which creates an avenue for the consideration of petitioner&#x92;s claims that did not exist at the time of <em>Quirin</em>.  Collateral application for habeas review was the <em>only</em> vehicle available.  And there was no compelling reason to postpone consideration of the <em>Quirin</em> application until the termination of military proceedings, because the only cognizable claims presented were general challenges to the authority of the commissions that would not be affected by the specific proceedings.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8&#x96;9, n. 2.  In the DTA, by contrast, Congress has expanded the scope of Article III review and has channeled it exclusively through a single, postverdict appeal to Article III courts.  Because Congress has created a novel unitary scheme of Article III review of military commissions that was absent in 1942, <em>Quirin</em> is no longer governing precedent.</p>

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-1" href="#ZD-1ref">1</a> The Court apparently believes that the effective-date provision means nothing at all.  &#x93;That paragraph (1), along with paragraphs (2) and (3), is to &#x91;take effect on the date of enactment,&#x92; DTA &#xA7;1005(h)(1),

, to the effect that &#x93;a statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.&#x94;  Ante, at 14, n. 9 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).  But this quote merely restates the obvious: An effective-date provision does not render a statute applicable to &#x93;conduct that occurred at an earlier date,&#x94; but of course it renders the statute applicable to conduct that occurs on the effective date and all future dates&#x97;such as the Court&#x92;s exercise of jurisdiction here.  The Court seems to suggest that, because the effective-date provision does not authorize retroactive application, it also fails to authorize prospective application (and is thus useless verbiage).  This cannot be true.

, shows this not to be true.  Subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) of &#xA7;1005 resemble the provisions of AEDPA at issue in Lindh (whose retroactivityas applied to pending cases the Lindh majority did not rule upon,see 521 U.

Subsection (e)(2) imposes judicial review on the Combatant Status ReviewTribunals (CSRTs), whose implementing order did not subject themto review by Article III courts. See Memorandum from Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz re: Order Establishing Com-batant Status Review Tribunals, at 3 &#xA7;h (July 7, 2004), avail-able at http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040707review.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 27, 2006, and availablein Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743. Historically, federal courts have never reviewed the validity of the final decision of any military commission; their jurisdiction has been restricted to considering the commission&#x92;s &#x93;lawful authority to hear, decide and condemn,&#x94;  In re Yamashita,

Thus, contrary to the Court&#x92;s suggestion, ante, at 17, subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) confer new jurisdiction: They impose judicial oversight on a traditionally unreviewable exercise of military authority by the Commander in Chief.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-9" href="#ZD-9ref">9</a> In rejecting our analysis, the Court observes that appeals to the D. C.

2743.  The relevance of this observation to the abstention question is unfathomable.  The fact that Article III review is discretionary does not mean that it lacks &#x93;structural insulation from military influence,&#x94; ante, at 23, and its discretionary nature presents no obstacle to the courts&#x92; future review these cases.


The Court might more cogently have relied on the discretionary nature of review to argue that the statute provides an inadequate substitute for habeas review under the Suspension Clause.  See supra, at 16&#x96;18.  But this argument would have no force, even if all appeals to the D. C. Circuit were discretionary.  The exercise of habeas jurisdiction has traditionally been entirely a matter of the court&#x92;s equitable discretion, see Withrow v. Williams,

        <p class="bodytext">    On December 30, 2005, Congress enacted the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA).  It unambiguously provides that, as of that date, &#x93;no court, justice, or judge&#x94; shall have jurisdiction to consider the habeas application of a Guantanamo Bay detainee.  Notwithstanding this plain directive, the Court today concludes that, on what it calls the statute&#x92;s <em>most natural</em> reading, <em>every</em> &#x93;court, justice, or judge&#x94; before whom such a habeas application was pending on December 30 has jurisdiction to hear, consider, and render judgment on it.  This conclusion is patently erroneous.  And even if it were not, the jurisdiction supposedly retained should, in an exercise of sound equitable discretion, not be exercised.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The DTA provides: &#x93;[N]o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742 (internal division omitted).  This provision &#x93;t[ook] effect on the date of the enactment of this Act,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(h)(1), <em>id.</em>, at 2743, which was December 30, 2005.  As of that date, then, <em>no</em> court had jurisdiction to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; the merits of petitioner&#x92;s habeas application.  This repeal of jurisdiction is simply not ambiguous as between pending and future cases.  It prohibits <em>any</em> exercise of jurisdiction, and it became effective as to <em>all</em> cases last December 30.  It is also perfectly clear that the phrase &#x93;no court, <em>justice</em>, or judge&#x94; includes this Court and its Members, and that by exercising our appellate jurisdiction in this case we are &#x93;hear[ing] or consider[ing] &#x2026; an application for a writ of habeas<span class="softbreak"/>corpus.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that statutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases pending at their effective date.  For example, in <em>Bruner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/343/112" class="subref" title="subref">343 U. S. 112</a> (1952)
, we granted certiorari to consider whether the Tucker Act&#x92;s provision denying district court jurisdiction over suits by &#x93;officers&#x94; of the United States barred a suit by an <em>employee</em> of the United States.  After we granted certiorari, Congress amended the Tucker Act by adding suits by &#x93; &#x91;employees&#x92; &#x94; to the provision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 114.  This statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district courts &#x93;became effective&#x94; while the case was pending before us, <em>ibid.</em>, and made no explicit reference to pending cases.  Because the statute &#x93;did not reserve jurisdiction over pending cases,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 115, we held that it clearly ousted jurisdiction over them.  Summarizing centuries of practice, we said: &#x93;This rule&#x97;that, when a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to pending cases, all cases fall with the law&#x97;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 116&#x96;117.  See also <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products</em>,

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>) (&#x93;We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction terminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not, as today&#x92;s opinion for the Court would have it, a judge-made &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11, that we have invented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes.  It is simple recognition of the reality that the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.  <em>And this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To alter this plain meaning, our cases have required an explicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdiction-repealing statute.  For example, <em>Bruner</em>, as mentioned, looked to whether Congress made &#x93;any reservation as to pending cases.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117; see also <em>id.</em>, at 115 (&#x93;Congress made no provision for cases pending at the effective date of the Act withdrawing jurisdiction and, for this reason, Courts of Appeals ordered pending cases terminated for want of jurisdiction&#x94;).  Likewise, in <em>Hallowell</em> v. <em>Commons</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/239/506" class="subref" title="subref">239 U. S. 506</a> (1916)
, Justice Holmes relied on the fact that the jurisdiction-ousting provision &#x93;made no exception for pending litigation, but purported to be universal,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 508.  And in <em>Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Ritchie</em>, 
5Wall.
541 (1867), we again relied on the fact that the jurisdictional repeal was made &#x93;without any saving of such causes as that before us,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 544.  As in <em>Bruner</em>, <em>Hallowell</em>, and <em>Ritchie</em>, the DTA&#x92;s directive that &#x93;no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742, is made &#x93;without any reservation as to pending cases&#x94; and &#x93;purport[s] to be universal.&#x94;  What we stated in an earlier case remains true here: &#x93;[W]hen, if it had been the intention to confine the operation of [the jurisdictional repeal] &#x2026; to cases not pending, it would have been so easy to have said so, we must presume that Congress meant the language employed should have its usual and ordinary signification, and that the old law should be unconditionally repealed.&#x94;  <em>Railroad Co.</em> v. <em>Grant</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    The Court claims that I &#x93;rea[d] too much into&#x94; the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases, <em>ante</em>, at 12, n. 7, and that &#x93;the <em>Bruner</em> rule&#x94; has never been &#x93;an inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19.  But the Court sorely misdescribes <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;as if it were a kind of early-day <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, resolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative inference.  On the contrary, as described above, <em>Bruner</em> stated its holding as an unqualified &#x93;rule,&#x94; which &#x93;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117.  Though <em>Bruner</em> referred to an express savings clause elsewhere in the statute, <em>id.,</em> at 115, n. 7, it disavowed any reliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain meaning, quoting <em>Ritchie</em> at length: &#x93; &#x91;It is quite possible that this effect of the [jurisdiction-stripping statute] was not contemplated by Congress&#x2026; .  [B]ut when terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention.&#x92; &#x94;  343 U. S., at 116 (quoting 5 Wall., at 544&#x96;545).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court also attempts to evade the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases by asserting that &#x93;the &#x91;presumption&#x92; [of application to pending cases] that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption&#x97;viz., the presumption against retroactivity&#x97;in certain limited circumstances.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  I have already explained that what the Court calls a &#x93;presumption&#x94; is simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous meaning of such provisions.  But even taking it to be what the Court says, the effect upon the present case would be the same.  <em>Prospective</em> applications of a statute are &#x93;effective&#x94; upon the statute&#x92;s effective date; that is what an effective-date provision like &#xA7;1005(h)(1) <em>means</em>.<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

            </a>  &#x93; &#x91;[S]hall take effect upon enactment&#x92; is presumed to mean &#x91;shall have prospective effect upon enactment,&#x92; and that presumption is too strong to be overcome by any negative inference [drawn from other provisions of the statute].&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 288 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, concurring in judgments).  The Court&#x92;s &#x93;nonapplication of &#x2026; the presumption against retroactivity&#x94; to &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is thus just another way of stating that the statute takes immediate effect in pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Though the Court resists the <em>Bruner</em> rule, it cannot cite a<em> single case</em> in the history of Anglo-American law (before today) in which a jurisdiction-stripping provision was denied immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation.  By contrast, the cases granting such immediate effect are legion, and they repeatedly rely on the plain language of the jurisdictional repeal as an &#x93;inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19, by requiring an express reservation to save pending cases.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Bruner</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 115; <em>Kline</em> v. <em>Burke Constr. Co.</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    Disregarding the plain meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the requirement of explicit exception set forth in the foregoing cases, the Court instead favors &#x93;a negative inference &#x2026; from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 13.  Specifically, it appeals to the fact that &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) are explicitly made applicable to pending cases (by &#xA7;1005(h)(2)).  A negative inference of the sort the Court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an ambiguous provision, but since the meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear, the omitted language in that context would have been redundant.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if &#xA7;1005(e)(1) were at all ambiguous in its application to pending cases, the &#x93;negative inference&#x94; from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) touted by the Court would have no force.  The numerous cases in the <em>Bruner</em> line would at least create a powerful default &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11.  The negative inference urged by the Court would be a particularly awkward and indirect way of rebutting such a longstanding and consistent practice.  This is especially true since the negative inference that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(h)(2)&#x92;s specification that certain provisions <em>shall</em> apply to pending cases is matched by a negative inference in the opposite direction that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(b)(2), which provides that certain provisions shall <em>not </em>apply to pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court&#x92;s reliance on our opinion in <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, is utterly misplaced.  <em>Lindh</em> involved two provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA): a set of amendments to chapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined the scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts; and a provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas statute specially to govern federal collateral review of state capital cases.  See 521 U. S., at 326&#x96;327.  The latter provision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applicable to cases pending at the time of AEDPA&#x92;s enactment; the former made no specific reference to pending cases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 327.  In <em>Lindh</em>, we drew a negative inference from chapter 154&#x92;s explicit reference to pending cases, to conclude that the chapter 153 amendments did <em>not</em> apply in pending cases.  It was essential to our reasoning, however, that both provisions appeared to be <em>identically difficult</em> to classify under our retroactivity cases.  First, we noted that, after <em>Landgraf</em>, there was reason for Congress to suppose that an explicit statement was required to render the amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending cases, because the new chapter 154 &#x93;will have substantive as well as purely procedural effects.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 327.  The next step&#x97;and the critical step&#x97;in our reasoning was that Congress had <em>identical</em> reason to suppose that an explicit statement would be required to apply the chapter 153 amendments to pending cases, but did not provide it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  The negative inference of <em>Lindh</em> rested on the fact that &#x93;[n]othing &#x2026; but a different intent explain[ed] the different treatment.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Here, by contrast, there is ample reason for the different treatment.  The exclusive-review provisions of the DTA, unlike both &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the AEDPA amendments in <em>Lindh</em>, confer <em>new</em> jurisdiction (in the D. C. Circuit)  where there was none before.  For better or for worse, our recent cases have contrasted jurisdiction-<em>creating</em> provisions with jurisdiction-<em>ousting</em> provisions, retaining the venerable rule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied in pending cases, but strongly indicating that the former are typically retroactive.  For example, we stated in <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)
, that a statute &#x93;that <em>creates</em> jurisdiction where none previously existed&#x94; is &#x93;as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other.&#x94;  See also <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>,

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J</span>.); <em>id.</em>, at 722 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy</span>, J., dissenting).  The Court gives our retroactivity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that &#x93;subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents.&#x94;<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            <em>Ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18.  This statement rises to the level of sarcasm when one considers its author&#x92;s description of the governing test of our retroactivity jurisprudence:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The conclusion that a particular rule operates &#x91;retroactively&#x92; comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.  Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.  However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have &#x91;sound &#x2026; instinct[s],&#x92; &#x2026; and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 270 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The only &#x93;familiar consideration,&#x94; &#x93;reasonable reliance,&#x94; and &#x93;settled expectation&#x94; I am aware of pertaining to the present case is the rule of <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;applicable to &#xA7;1005(e)(1), but not to &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)&#x97;which the Court stubbornly disregards.  It is utterly beyond question that &#xA7;1005(e)(2)&#x92;s and (3)&#x92;s application to pending cases (without explicit specification) was not as clear as &#xA7;1005(e)(1)&#x92;s.  That is alone enough to explain the difference in treatment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Another obvious reason for the specification was to stave off any Suspension Clause problems raised by the immediately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by subsection (e)(1).  That is to say, specification of the immediate effectiveness of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) (which, unlike subsection (e)(1), would not fall within the <em>Bruner </em>rule and would not <em>automatically</em> be deemed applicable in pending cases) could reasonably have been thought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas jurisdiction that subsection (e)(1) eliminated in pending cases with an adequate substitute.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These considerations by no means prove that an explicit statement would be <em>required</em> to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable in pending cases.  But they surely gave Congress ample reason to <em>doubt</em> that their application in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the Court glibly assumes.  In any event, even if it were true that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x93; &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18, this would merely establish that subsection (h)(2)&#x92;s reference to pending cases was wholly superfluous when applied to subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3), just as it would have been for subsection (e)(1).  <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference makes sense only when Congress would have perceived &#x93;the wisdom of being explicit&#x94; with respect to the immediate application of <em>both</em> of two statutory provisions, 521 U. S., at 328, but chose to be explicit only for one of them&#x97;not when it would have perceived <em>no need </em>to be explicit for both, but enacted a redundancy only for one.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, it is simply untrue that Congress &#x93; &#x91;should have been just as concerned about&#x92; &#x94; specifying the application of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) to pending cases, <em>ante</em>, at 14 (quoting <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329).  In fact, the negative-inference approach of <em>Lindh</em> is particularly inappropriate in this case, because the negative inference from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) would tend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that <em>are</em> explicitly rendered applicable in pending cases, &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3).  Those provisions purport to vest &#x93;exclusive&#x94; jurisdiction in the D. C. Circuit to consider the claims raised by petitioners here.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.  By drawing a negative inference <em>&lt;fs fs="11.5"&gt;&amp;Agrave;</em>
            <em>la</em>
            <em>Lindh</em>, the Court supplants this exclusive-review mechanism with a dual-review mechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to file applications challenging the CSRTs or military commissions before December 30, 2005.  Whatever the force of <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference in other cases, it surely should not apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision from which the negative inference is drawn.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Worst of all is the Court&#x92;s reliance on the legislative history of the DTA to buttress its implausible reading of &#xA7;1005(e)(1).  We have repeatedly held that such reliance is impermissible where, as here, the statutory language is unambiguous.  But the Court nevertheless relies both on floor statements from the Senate and (quite heavily) on the drafting history of the DTA.  To begin with floor statements: The Court urges that some &#x93;statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to&#x94; the Court&#x92;s interpretation, citing excerpts from the floor debate that support its view, <em>ante</em>, 15&#x96;16, n. 10.  The Court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor statements by the DTA&#x92;s sponsors that flatly contradict its view, because &#x93;those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record <em>after</em> the Senate debate.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Of course this observation, even if true, makes no difference unless one indulges the fantasy that Senate floor speeches are attended (like the Philippics of Demosthenes) by throngs of eager listeners, instead of being delivered (like Demosthenes&#x92; practice sessions on the beach) alone into a vast emptiness.  Whether the floor statements are spoken where no Senator hears, or written where no Senator reads, they represent at most the views of a single Senator.  In any event, the Court greatly exaggerates the one-sidedness of the portions of the floor debate that clearly occurred before the DTA&#x92;s enactment.  Some of the statements of Senator Graham, a sponsor of the bill, only make sense on the assumption that pending cases are covered.<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

            </a>  And at least one opponent of the DTA unmistakably expressed his understanding that it would terminate our jurisdiction in this very case.<a name="ZD-4ref" href="#ZD-4" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    But selectivity is not the greatest vice in the Court&#x92;s use of floor statements to resolve today&#x92;s case.  These statements were made when Members of Congress were fully aware that our continuing jurisdiction <em>over this very case</em> was at issue.  The question was divisive, and floor statements made on both sides were undoubtedly opportunistic and crafted <em>solely</em> for use in the briefs in this very litigation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 151 Cong. Rec. S14257&#x96;S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen. Levin) (arguing against a reading that would &#x93;stri[p] the Federal courts of jurisdiction to consider pending cases, <em>including the Hamdan case now pending in the Supreme Court</em>,&#x94; and urging that <em>Lindh</em> requires the same negative inference that the Court indulges today (emphasis added)).  The Court&#x92;s reliance on such statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar opportunism.  In a virtually identical context, the author of today&#x92;s opinion has written for the Court that &#x93;[t]he legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 262 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).  Likewise, the handful of floor statements that the Court treats as authoritative do not &#x93;reflec[t] any general agreement.&#x94;  They reflect the now-common tactic&#x97;which the Court once again rewards&#x97;of pursuing through floor-speech <em>ipse dixit</em> what could not be achieved through the constitutionally prescribed method of putting language into a bill that a majority of both Houses vote for and the President signs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the floor statements, at least the Court shows some semblance of seemly shame, tucking away its reference to them in a half-hearted footnote.  Not so for its reliance on the DTA&#x92;s drafting history, which is displayed prominently, see <em>ante</em>, at 14&#x96;15.  I have explained elsewhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or reliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute than any other form of legislative history.  This case presents a textbook example of its unreliability.  The Court, <em>ante</em>, at 14, trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the Senate included redundant language, not included in the DTA as passed, reconfirming that the abolition of habeas jurisdiction &#x93;shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.&#x94;  151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005).  But this earlier version of the bill also differed from the DTA in other material respects.  Most notably, it provided for postdecision review by the D. C. Circuit only of the decisions of <em>CSRTs</em>, not military commissions, <em>ibid.; </em>and it limited that review to whether &#x93;the status determination &#x2026; was consistent with the procedures and standards specified by the Secretary of Defense,&#x94; <em>ibid.,</em> not whether &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures &#x2026; is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742.  To say that what moved Senators to reject this earlier bill was the &#x93;action that is pending&#x94; provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even this Court&#x92;s greatest Justices.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>6</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And to think that the House and the President also had this rejection firmly in mind is absurd.  As always&#x97;but <em>especially</em> in the context of strident, partisan legislative conflict of the sort that characterized enactment of this legislation&#x97;the language of the statute that was actually passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President is our only authoritative and only reliable guidepost.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A final but powerful indication of the fact that the Court has made a mess of this statute is the nature of the consequences that ensue.  Though this case concerns a habeas application challenging a trial by military commission, DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(1) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider <em>any</em> &#x93;application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  The vast majority of pending petitions, no doubt, do not relate to military commissions at all, but to more commonly challenged aspects of &#x93;detention&#x94; such as the terms and conditions of confinement.  See <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/466" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 466</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">498</a> (2004)
 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  The Solicitor General represents that &#x93;[h]abeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a purported 600 [Guantanamo Bay] detainees,&#x94; including one that &#x93;seek[s] relief on behalf of every Guantanamo detainee who has not already filed an action,&#x94; Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 20, n. 10 (hereinafter Motion to Dismiss).  The Court&#x92;s interpretation transforms a provision abolishing jurisdiction over <em>all</em> Guantanamo-related habeas petitions into a provision that retains jurisdiction over cases sufficiently numerous to keep the courts busy for years to come.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Because I would hold that &#xA7;1005(e)(1) unambiguously terminates the jurisdiction of all courts to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; pending habeas applications, I must confront petitioner&#x92;s arguments that the provision, so interpreted, violates the Suspension Clause.  This claim is easily dispatched.  We stated in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;We are cited to no instance where a court, in this or any other country where the writ is known, has issued it on behalf of an alien enemy who, at no relevant time and in no stage of his captivity, has been within its territorial jurisdiction.  Nothing in the text of the Constitution extends such a right, nor does anything in our statutes.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Notwithstanding the ill-considered dicta in the Court&#x92;s opinion in <em>Rasul</em>, 542 U.

See <em>id.</em>, at 500&#x96;505 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  Petitioner, an enemy alien detained abroad, has no rights under the Suspension Clause.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But even if petitioner were fully protected by the Clause, the DTA would create no suspension problem.  This Court has repeatedly acknowledged that &#x93;the substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person&#x92;s detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.&#x94;  <em>Swain</em> v. <em>Pressley</em>,

 (&#x93;Congress could, without raising any constitutional questions, provide an adequate substitute through the courts of appeals&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner has made no showing that the postdecision exclusive review by the D. C. Circuit provided in &#xA7;1005(e)(3) is inadequate to test the legality of his trial by military commission.  His principal argument is that the exclusive-review provisions are inadequate because they foreclose review of the claims he raises here.  Though petitioner&#x92;s brief does not parse the statutory language, his argument evidently rests on an erroneously narrow reading of DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  That provision grants the D. C. Circuit authority to review, &#x93;to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.&#x94;  In the quoted text, the phrase &#x93;such standards and procedures&#x94; refers to &#x93;the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (A),&#x94; namely &#x93;Military Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).&#x94;  DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(i), (e)(3)(A), <em>ibid</em>.  This Military Commission Order (Order No. 1) is the Department of Defense&#x92;s fundamental implementing order for the President&#x92;s order authorizing trials by military commission.  Order No. 1 establishes commissions, &#xA7;2; delineates their jurisdiction, &#xA7;3; provides for their officers, &#xA7;4(A); provides for their prosecution and defense counsel, &#xA7;4(B), (C); lays out all their procedures, both pretrial and trial, &#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P), &#xA7;6(A)&#x96;(G); and provides for posttrial military review through the Secretary of Defense and the President, &#xA7;6(H).  In short, the &#x93;standards and procedures specified in&#x94; Order No. 1 include <em>every aspect</em> of the military commissions, including the fact of their existence and every respect in which they differ from courts-martial.  Petitioner&#x92;s claims that the President lacks legal authority to try him before a military commission constitute claims that &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures,&#x94; as specified in Order No. 1, is &#x93;[in]consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  The D. C. Circuit thus retains jurisdiction to consider these claims on postdecision review, and the Government does not dispute that the DTA leaves unaffected our certiorari jurisdiction under

Thus, the DTA merely <em>defers</em> our jurisdiction to consider petitioner&#x92;s claims; it does not eliminate that jurisdiction.  It constitutes neither an &#x93;inadequate&#x94; nor an &#x93;ineffective&#x94; substitute for petitioner&#x92;s pending habeas application.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Though it does not squarely address the issue, the Court hints ominously that &#x93;the Government&#x92;s preferred reading&#x94; would &#x93;rais[e] grave questions about Congress&#x92; authority to impinge upon this Court&#x92;s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 10&#x96;11 (citing <em>Ex parte Yerger</em>,

85 (1869); <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin</em>,

128 (1872); and <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506).  It is not clear how there could be any such lurking questions, in light of the aptly named &#x93;<em>Exceptions</em> Clause&#x94; of Article III, &#xA7;2, which, in making our appellate jurisdiction subject to &#x93;such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make,&#x94; explicitly permits exactly what Congress has done here.  But any doubt our prior cases might have created on this score is surely chimerical in <em>this</em> case.  As just noted, the exclusive-review provisions provide a substitute for habeas review adequate to satisfy the Suspension Clause, which <em>forbids</em> the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.  <em>A fortiori</em> they provide a substitute adequate to satisfy any implied substantive limitations, whether real or imaginary, upon the Exceptions Clause, which <em>authorizes</em> such exceptions as &#xA7;1005(e)(1).</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if Congress had not clearly and constitutionally eliminated jurisdiction over this case, neither this Court nor the lower courts ought to exercise it.  Traditionally, equitable principles govern both the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and the granting of the injunctive relief sought by petitioner.  See <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a>,

.  In light of Congress&#x92;s provision of an alternate avenue for petitioner&#x92;s claims in &#xA7;1005(e)(3), those equitable principles counsel that we abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In requesting abstention, the Government relies principally on <em>Councilman</em>, in which we abstained from considering a serviceman&#x92;s claim that his charge for marijuana possession was not sufficiently &#x93;service-connected&#x94; to trigger the subject-matter jurisdiction of the military courts-martial.  See 420 U. S., at 740, 758.  Admittedly, <em>Councilman</em> does not squarely control petitioner&#x92;s case, but it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence.  As the Court describes, <em>ante</em>, at 21, <em>Councilman</em> &#x93;identifie[d] two considerations of comity that together favor[ed] abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings against service personnel.&#x94;  But the Court errs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this case.  Both of them, and a third consideration not emphasized in <em>Councilman</em>, all cut in favor of abstention here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, the Court observes that <em>Councilman</em> rested in part on the fact that &#x93;military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts,&#x94; and concludes that &#x93;Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  This is true enough.  But for some reason, the Court fails to make any inquiry into whether military commission trials might involve <em>other</em> &#x93;military necessities&#x94; or &#x93;unique military exigencies,&#x94; 420 U. S., at 757, comparable in gravity to those at stake in <em>Councilman</em>.  To put this in context: The charge against the respondent in <em>Councilman</em> was the off-base possession and sale of marijuana while he was stationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, see <em>id.,</em> at 739&#x96;740.  The charge against the petitioner here is joining and actively abetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thousands of innocent American civilians without warning on September 11, 2001.  While <em>Councilman</em> held that the prosecution of the former charge involved &#x93;military necessities&#x94; counseling against our interference, the Court <em>does not even ponder the same question</em> for the latter charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The reason for the Court&#x92;s &#x93;blinkered study&#x94; of this question, <em>ante</em>, at 19, is not hard to fathom.  The principal opinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe that the trials by military commission involve any &#x93;military necessity&#x94; <em>at all:</em> &#x93;The charge&#x92;s shortcomings &#x2026; are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition &#x2026; for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 48.  This is quite at odds with the views on this subject expressed by our political branches.  Because of &#x93;military necessity,&#x94; a joint session of Congress authorized the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force,&#x94; including military commissions, &#x93;against those nations, organizations, or persons [such as petitioner] he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force, &#xA7;2(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224, note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1541.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. &#xA7;1541</a> (2000 ed., Supp. III).  In keeping with this authority, the President has determined that &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order &#x2026; to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 2001, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e) (2002).  It is not clear where the Court derives the authority&#x97;or the audacity&#x97;to contradict this determination.  If &#x93;military necessities&#x94; relating to &#x93;duty&#x94; and &#x93;discipline&#x94; required abstention in <em>Councilman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 757, military necessities relating to the disabling, deterrence, and punishment of the mass-murdering terrorists of September 11 require abstention all the more here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court further seeks to distinguish <em>Councilman</em> on the ground that &#x93;the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  To be sure, <em>Councilman</em> emphasized that &#x93;Congress created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion, who would gain over time thorough familiarity with military problems.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 758 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).  The Court contrasts this &#x93;integrated system&#x94; insulated from military influence with the review scheme established by Order No. 1, which &#x93;provides that appeal of a review panel&#x92;s decision may be had only to the Secretary of Defense himself, &#xA7;6(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, &#xA7;6(H)(6).&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if we were to accept the Court&#x92;s extraordinary assumption that the President &#x93;lack[s] the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 23,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

            </a> the Court&#x92;s description of the review scheme here is anachronistic.  As of December 30, 2005, the &#x93;fina[l]&#x94; review of decisions by military commissions is now conducted by the D. C. Circuit pursuant to &#xA7;1005(e)(3) of the DTA, and by this Court under

                <sup>
                    <b>9</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  At the time we decided <em>Councilman</em>, Congress had not &#x93;conferred on any Art[icle] III court jurisdiction directly to review court-martial determinations.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 746.  The final arbiter of direct appeals was the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), an Article I court whose members possessed neither life tenure, nor salary protection, nor the constitutional protection from removal provided to federal judges in Article III, &#xA7;1.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/867.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;867(a)(2)</a> (1970 ed.).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Moreover, a third consideration counsels strongly in favor of abstention in this case.  <em>Councilman</em> reasoned that the &#x93;considerations of comity, the necessity of respect for coordinate judicial systems&#x94; that motivated our decision in <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
, were inapplicable to courts-martial, because &#x93;the particular demands of federalism are not implicated.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 756, 757.  Though military commissions likewise do not implicate &#x93;the particular demands of federalism,&#x94; considerations of <em>interbranch</em> comity at the federal level weigh heavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case.  Here, apparently for the first time in history, see Motion to Dismiss 6, a District Court enjoined ongoing military commission proceedings, which had been deemed &#x93;necessary&#x94; by the President &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e).  Such an order brings the Judicial Branch into direct conflict with the Executive in an area where the Executive&#x92;s competence is maximal and ours is virtually nonexistent.  We should exercise our equitable discretion to <em>avoid</em> such conflict.  Instead, the Court rushes headlong to meet it.  Elsewhere, we have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state courts have &#x93;the first opportunity to review&#x94; a petitioner&#x92;s claim, merely to &#x93;reduc[e] friction between the state and federal court systems.&#x94;  <em>O&#x92;Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/526/838" class="subref" title="subref">526 U. S. 838</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">844</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">845</a> (1999)
.  The &#x93;friction&#x94; created today between this Court and the Executive Branch is many times more serious.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the face of such concerns, the Court relies heavily on <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/1" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 1</a> (1942)
: &#x93;Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, [in <em>Quirin</em>] we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  It is likely that the Government in <em>Quirin</em>, unlike here, preferred a hasty resolution of the case in this Court, so that it could swiftly execute the sentences imposed, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/507" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 507</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">569</a> (2004)
 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J</span>., dissenting).  But the Court&#x92;s reliance on <em>Quirin</em> suffers from a more fundamental defect: Once again, it ignores the DTA, which creates an avenue for the consideration of petitioner&#x92;s claims that did not exist at the time of <em>Quirin</em>.  Collateral application for habeas review was the <em>only</em> vehicle available.  And there was no compelling reason to postpone consideration of the <em>Quirin</em> application until the termination of military proceedings, because the only cognizable claims presented were general challenges to the authority of the commissions that would not be affected by the specific proceedings.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8&#x96;9, n. 2.  In the DTA, by contrast, Congress has expanded the scope of Article III review and has channeled it exclusively through a single, postverdict appeal to Article III courts.  Because Congress has created a novel unitary scheme of Article III review of military commissions that was absent in 1942, <em>Quirin</em> is no longer governing precedent.</p>

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-1" href="#ZD-1ref">1</a> The Court apparently believes that the effective-date provision means nothing at all.  &#x93;That paragraph (1), along with paragraphs (2) and (3), is to &#x91;take effect on the date of enactment,&#x92; DTA &#xA7;1005(h)(1),

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">317</a> (2001)
, to the effect that &#x93;a statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.&#x94;  Ante, at 14, n. 9 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).  But this quote merely restates the obvious: An effective-date provision does not render a statute applicable to &#x93;conduct that occurred at an earlier date,&#x94; but of course it renders the statute applicable to conduct that occurs on the effective date and all future dates&#x97;such as the Court&#x92;s exercise of jurisdiction here.  The Court seems to suggest that, because the effective-date provision does not authorize retroactive application, it also fails to authorize prospective application (and is thus useless verbiage).  This cannot be true.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-2" href="#ZD-2ref">2</a> A comparison with Lindh v. Murphy, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, shows this not to be true.  Subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) of &#xA7;1005 resemble the provisions of AEDPA at issue in Lindh (whose retroactivityas applied to pending cases the Lindh majority did not rule upon,see 521 U. S., at 326), in that they &#x93;g[o] beyond &#x91;mere&#x92; procedure,&#x94;id., at 327.  They impose novel and unprecedented disabilities onthe Executive Branch in its conduct of military affairs.  Subsection (e)(2) imposes judicial review on the Combatant Status ReviewTribunals (CSRTs), whose implementing order did not subject themto review by Article III courts. See Memorandum from Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz re: Order Establishing Com-batant Status Review Tribunals, at 3 &#xA7;h (July 7, 2004), avail-able at http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040707review.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 27, 2006, and availablein Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743. Historically, federal courts have never reviewed the validity of the final decision of any military commission; their jurisdiction has been restricted to considering the commission&#x92;s &#x93;lawful authority to hear, decide and condemn,&#x94;  In re Yamashita, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/1" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 1</a>,

.  Thus, contrary to the Court&#x92;s suggestion, ante, at 17, subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) confer new jurisdiction: They impose judicial oversight on a traditionally unreviewable exercise of military authority by the Commander in Chief.

2743.  The relevance of this observation to the abstention question is unfathomable.  The fact that Article III review is discretionary does not mean that it lacks &#x93;structural insulation from military influence,&#x94; ante, at 23, and its discretionary nature presents no obstacle to the courts&#x92; future review these cases.


The Court might more cogently have relied on the discretionary nature of review to argue that the statute provides an inadequate substitute for habeas review under the Suspension Clause.  See supra, at 16&#x96;18.  But this argument would have no force, even if all appeals to the D. C. Circuit were discretionary.  The exercise of habeas jurisdiction has traditionally been entirely a matter of the court&#x92;s equitable discretion, see Withrow v. Williams,

        <p class="bodytext">    On December 30, 2005, Congress enacted the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA).  It unambiguously provides that, as of that date, &#x93;no court, justice, or judge&#x94; shall have jurisdiction to consider the habeas application of a Guantanamo Bay detainee.  Notwithstanding this plain directive, the Court today concludes that, on what it calls the statute&#x92;s <em>most natural</em> reading, <em>every</em> &#x93;court, justice, or judge&#x94; before whom such a habeas application was pending on December 30 has jurisdiction to hear, consider, and render judgment on it.  This conclusion is patently erroneous.  And even if it were not, the jurisdiction supposedly retained should, in an exercise of sound equitable discretion, not be exercised.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    The DTA provides: &#x93;[N]o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  &#xA7;1005(e)(1),

2742 (internal division omitted).  This provision &#x93;t[ook] effect on the date of the enactment of this Act,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(h)(1), <em>id.</em>, at 2743, which was December 30, 2005.  As of that date, then, <em>no</em> court had jurisdiction to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; the merits of petitioner&#x92;s habeas application.  This repeal of jurisdiction is simply not ambiguous as between pending and future cases.  It prohibits <em>any</em> exercise of jurisdiction, and it became effective as to <em>all</em> cases last December 30.  It is also perfectly clear that the phrase &#x93;no court, <em>justice</em>, or judge&#x94; includes this Court and its Members, and that by exercising our appellate jurisdiction in this case we are &#x93;hear[ing] or consider[ing] &#x2026; an application for a writ of habeas<span class="softbreak"/>corpus.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that statutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases pending at their effective date.  For example, in <em>Bruner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/343/112" class="subref" title="subref">343 U. S. 112</a> (1952)
, we granted certiorari to consider whether the Tucker Act&#x92;s provision denying district court jurisdiction over suits by &#x93;officers&#x94; of the United States barred a suit by an <em>employee</em> of the United States.  After we granted certiorari, Congress amended the Tucker Act by adding suits by &#x93; &#x91;employees&#x92; &#x94; to the provision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 114.  This statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district courts &#x93;became effective&#x94; while the case was pending before us, <em>ibid.</em>, and made no explicit reference to pending cases.  Because the statute &#x93;did not reserve jurisdiction over pending cases,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 115, we held that it clearly ousted jurisdiction over them.  Summarizing centuries of practice, we said: &#x93;This rule&#x97;that, when a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to pending cases, all cases fall with the law&#x97;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 116&#x96;117.

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>) (&#x93;We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction terminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not, as today&#x92;s opinion for the Court would have it, a judge-made &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11, that we have invented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes.  It is simple recognition of the reality that the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.  <em>And this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To alter this plain meaning, our cases have required an explicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdiction-repealing statute.  For example, <em>Bruner</em>, as mentioned, looked to whether Congress made &#x93;any reservation as to pending cases.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117; see also <em>id.</em>, at 115 (&#x93;Congress made no provision for cases pending at the effective date of the Act withdrawing jurisdiction and, for this reason, Courts of Appeals ordered pending cases terminated for want of jurisdiction&#x94;).  Likewise, in <em>Hallowell</em> v. <em>Commons</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/239/506" class="subref" title="subref">239 U. S. 506</a> (1916)
, Justice Holmes relied on the fact that the jurisdiction-ousting provision &#x93;made no exception for pending litigation, but purported to be universal,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 508.  And in <em>Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Ritchie</em>, 
5Wall.
541 (1867), we again relied on the fact that the jurisdictional repeal was made &#x93;without any saving of such causes as that before us,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 544.  As in <em>Bruner</em>, <em>Hallowell</em>, and <em>Ritchie</em>, the DTA&#x92;s directive that &#x93;no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742, is made &#x93;without any reservation as to pending cases&#x94; and &#x93;purport[s] to be universal.&#x94;  What we stated in an earlier case remains true here: &#x93;[W]hen, if it had been the intention to confine the operation of [the jurisdictional repeal] &#x2026; to cases not pending, it would have been so easy to have said so, we must presume that Congress meant the language employed should have its usual and ordinary signification, and that the old law should be unconditionally repealed.&#x94;  <em>Railroad Co.</em> v. <em>Grant</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    The Court claims that I &#x93;rea[d] too much into&#x94; the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases, <em>ante</em>, at 12, n. 7, and that &#x93;the <em>Bruner</em> rule&#x94; has never been &#x93;an inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19.  But the Court sorely misdescribes <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;as if it were a kind of early-day <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, resolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative inference.  On the contrary, as described above, <em>Bruner</em> stated its holding as an unqualified &#x93;rule,&#x94; which &#x93;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117.  Though <em>Bruner</em> referred to an express savings clause elsewhere in the statute, <em>id.,</em> at 115, n. 7, it disavowed any reliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain meaning, quoting <em>Ritchie</em> at length: &#x93; &#x91;It is quite possible that this effect of the [jurisdiction-stripping statute] was not contemplated by Congress&#x2026; .  [B]ut when terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention.&#x92; &#x94;  343 U. S., at 116 (quoting 5 Wall., at 544&#x96;545).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court also attempts to evade the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases by asserting that &#x93;the &#x91;presumption&#x92; [of application to pending cases] that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption&#x97;viz., the presumption against retroactivity&#x97;in certain limited circumstances.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  I have already explained that what the Court calls a &#x93;presumption&#x94; is simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous meaning of such provisions.  But even taking it to be what the Court says, the effect upon the present case would be the same.  <em>Prospective</em> applications of a statute are &#x93;effective&#x94; upon the statute&#x92;s effective date; that is what an effective-date provision like &#xA7;1005(h)(1) <em>means</em>.<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

            </a>  &#x93; &#x91;[S]hall take effect upon enactment&#x92; is presumed to mean &#x91;shall have prospective effect upon enactment,&#x92; and that presumption is too strong to be overcome by any negative inference [drawn from other provisions of the statute].&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 288 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, concurring in judgments).  The Court&#x92;s &#x93;nonapplication of &#x2026; the presumption against retroactivity&#x94; to &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is thus just another way of stating that the statute takes immediate effect in pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Though the Court resists the <em>Bruner</em> rule, it cannot cite a<em> single case</em> in the history of Anglo-American law (before today) in which a jurisdiction-stripping provision was denied immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation.  By contrast, the cases granting such immediate effect are legion, and they repeatedly rely on the plain language of the jurisdictional repeal as an &#x93;inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19, by requiring an express reservation to save pending cases.

        <p class="bodytext">    Disregarding the plain meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the requirement of explicit exception set forth in the foregoing cases, the Court instead favors &#x93;a negative inference &#x2026; from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 13.  Specifically, it appeals to the fact that &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) are explicitly made applicable to pending cases (by &#xA7;1005(h)(2)).  A negative inference of the sort the Court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an ambiguous provision, but since the meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear, the omitted language in that context would have been redundant.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if &#xA7;1005(e)(1) were at all ambiguous in its application to pending cases, the &#x93;negative inference&#x94; from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) touted by the Court would have no force.  The numerous cases in the <em>Bruner</em> line would at least create a powerful default &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11.  The negative inference urged by the Court would be a particularly awkward and indirect way of rebutting such a longstanding and consistent practice.  This is especially true since the negative inference that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(h)(2)&#x92;s specification that certain provisions <em>shall</em> apply to pending cases is matched by a negative inference in the opposite direction that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(b)(2), which provides that certain provisions shall <em>not </em>apply to pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court&#x92;s reliance on our opinion in <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, is utterly misplaced.  <em>Lindh</em> involved two provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA): a set of amendments to chapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined the scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts; and a provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas statute specially to govern federal collateral review of state capital cases.  See 521 U. S., at 326&#x96;327.  The latter provision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applicable to cases pending at the time of AEDPA&#x92;s enactment; the former made no specific reference to pending cases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 327.  In <em>Lindh</em>, we drew a negative inference from chapter 154&#x92;s explicit reference to pending cases, to conclude that the chapter 153 amendments did <em>not</em> apply in pending cases.  It was essential to our reasoning, however, that both provisions appeared to be <em>identically difficult</em> to classify under our retroactivity cases.  First, we noted that, after <em>Landgraf</em>, there was reason for Congress to suppose that an explicit statement was required to render the amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending cases, because the new chapter 154 &#x93;will have substantive as well as purely procedural effects.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 327.  The next step&#x97;and the critical step&#x97;in our reasoning was that Congress had <em>identical</em> reason to suppose that an explicit statement would be required to apply the chapter 153 amendments to pending cases, but did not provide it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  The negative inference of <em>Lindh</em> rested on the fact that &#x93;[n]othing &#x2026; but a different intent explain[ed] the different treatment.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Here, by contrast, there is ample reason for the different treatment.  The exclusive-review provisions of the DTA, unlike both &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the AEDPA amendments in <em>Lindh</em>, confer <em>new</em> jurisdiction (in the D. C. Circuit)  where there was none before.  For better or for worse, our recent cases have contrasted jurisdiction-<em>creating</em> provisions with jurisdiction-<em>ousting</em> provisions, retaining the venerable rule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied in pending cases, but strongly indicating that the former are typically retroactive.  For example, we stated in <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)
, that a statute &#x93;that <em>creates</em> jurisdiction where none previously existed&#x94; is &#x93;as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other.&#x94;  See also <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>,

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J</span>.); <em>id.</em>, at 722 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy</span>, J., dissenting).  The Court gives our retroactivity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that &#x93;subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents.&#x94;<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            <em>Ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18.  This statement rises to the level of sarcasm when one considers its author&#x92;s description of the governing test of our retroactivity jurisprudence:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The conclusion that a particular rule operates &#x91;retroactively&#x92; comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.  Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.  However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have &#x91;sound &#x2026; instinct[s],&#x92; &#x2026; and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 270 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The only &#x93;familiar consideration,&#x94; &#x93;reasonable reliance,&#x94; and &#x93;settled expectation&#x94; I am aware of pertaining to the present case is the rule of <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;applicable to &#xA7;1005(e)(1), but not to &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)&#x97;which the Court stubbornly disregards.  It is utterly beyond question that &#xA7;1005(e)(2)&#x92;s and (3)&#x92;s application to pending cases (without explicit specification) was not as clear as &#xA7;1005(e)(1)&#x92;s.  That is alone enough to explain the difference in treatment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Another obvious reason for the specification was to stave off any Suspension Clause problems raised by the immediately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by subsection (e)(1).  That is to say, specification of the immediate effectiveness of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) (which, unlike subsection (e)(1), would not fall within the <em>Bruner </em>rule and would not <em>automatically</em> be deemed applicable in pending cases) could reasonably have been thought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas jurisdiction that subsection (e)(1) eliminated in pending cases with an adequate substitute.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These considerations by no means prove that an explicit statement would be <em>required</em> to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable in pending cases.  But they surely gave Congress ample reason to <em>doubt</em> that their application in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the Court glibly assumes.  In any event, even if it were true that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x93; &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18, this would merely establish that subsection (h)(2)&#x92;s reference to pending cases was wholly superfluous when applied to subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3), just as it would have been for subsection (e)(1).  <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference makes sense only when Congress would have perceived &#x93;the wisdom of being explicit&#x94; with respect to the immediate application of <em>both</em> of two statutory provisions, 521 U. S., at 328, but chose to be explicit only for one of them&#x97;not when it would have perceived <em>no need </em>to be explicit for both, but enacted a redundancy only for one.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, it is simply untrue that Congress &#x93; &#x91;should have been just as concerned about&#x92; &#x94; specifying the application of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) to pending cases, <em>ante</em>, at 14 (quoting <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329).  In fact, the negative-inference approach of <em>Lindh</em> is particularly inappropriate in this case, because the negative inference from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) would tend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that <em>are</em> explicitly rendered applicable in pending cases, &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3).  Those provisions purport to vest &#x93;exclusive&#x94; jurisdiction in the D. C. Circuit to consider the claims raised by petitioners here.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.  By drawing a negative inference <em>&lt;fs fs="11.5"&gt;&amp;Agrave;</em>
            <em>la</em>
            <em>Lindh</em>, the Court supplants this exclusive-review mechanism with a dual-review mechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to file applications challenging the CSRTs or military commissions before December 30, 2005.  Whatever the force of <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference in other cases, it surely should not apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision from which the negative inference is drawn.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Worst of all is the Court&#x92;s reliance on the legislative history of the DTA to buttress its implausible reading of &#xA7;1005(e)(1).  We have repeatedly held that such reliance is impermissible where, as here, the statutory language is unambiguous.  But the Court nevertheless relies both on floor statements from the Senate and (quite heavily) on the drafting history of the DTA.  To begin with floor statements: The Court urges that some &#x93;statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to&#x94; the Court&#x92;s interpretation, citing excerpts from the floor debate that support its view, <em>ante</em>, 15&#x96;16, n. 10.  The Court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor statements by the DTA&#x92;s sponsors that flatly contradict its view, because &#x93;those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record <em>after</em> the Senate debate.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Of course this observation, even if true, makes no difference unless one indulges the fantasy that Senate floor speeches are attended (like the Philippics of Demosthenes) by throngs of eager listeners, instead of being delivered (like Demosthenes&#x92; practice sessions on the beach) alone into a vast emptiness.  Whether the floor statements are spoken where no Senator hears, or written where no Senator reads, they represent at most the views of a single Senator.  In any event, the Court greatly exaggerates the one-sidedness of the portions of the floor debate that clearly occurred before the DTA&#x92;s enactment.

        <p class="bodytext">    But selectivity is not the greatest vice in the Court&#x92;s use of floor statements to resolve today&#x92;s case.  These statements were made when Members of Congress were fully aware that our continuing jurisdiction <em>over this very case</em> was at issue.  The question was divisive, and floor statements made on both sides were undoubtedly opportunistic and crafted <em>solely</em> for use in the briefs in this very litigation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 151 Cong. Rec. S14257&#x96;S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen. Levin) (arguing against a reading that would &#x93;stri[p] the Federal courts of jurisdiction to consider pending cases, <em>including the Hamdan case now pending in the Supreme Court</em>,&#x94; and urging that <em>Lindh</em> requires the same negative inference that the Court indulges today (emphasis added)).  The Court&#x92;s reliance on such statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar opportunism.  In a virtually identical context, the author of today&#x92;s opinion has written for the Court that &#x93;[t]he legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 262 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).  Likewise, the handful of floor statements that the Court treats as authoritative do not &#x93;reflec[t] any general agreement.&#x94;  They reflect the now-common tactic&#x97;which the Court once again rewards&#x97;of pursuing through floor-speech <em>ipse dixit</em> what could not be achieved through the constitutionally prescribed method of putting language into a bill that a majority of both Houses vote for and the President signs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the floor statements, at least the Court shows some semblance of seemly shame, tucking away its reference to them in a half-hearted footnote.  Not so for its reliance on the DTA&#x92;s drafting history, which is displayed prominently, see <em>ante</em>, at 14&#x96;15.  I have explained elsewhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or reliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute than any other form of legislative history.  This case presents a textbook example of its unreliability.  The Court, <em>ante</em>, at 14, trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the Senate included redundant language, not included in the DTA as passed, reconfirming that the abolition of habeas jurisdiction &#x93;shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.&#x94;  151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005).  But this earlier version of the bill also differed from the DTA in other material respects.  Most notably, it provided for postdecision review by the D. C. Circuit only of the decisions of <em>CSRTs</em>, not military commissions, <em>ibid.; </em>and it limited that review to whether &#x93;the status determination &#x2026; was consistent with the procedures and standards specified by the Secretary of Defense,&#x94; <em>ibid.,</em> not whether &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures &#x2026; is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742.  To say that what moved Senators to reject this earlier bill was the &#x93;action that is pending&#x94; provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even this Court&#x92;s greatest Justices.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  And to think that the House and the President also had this rejection firmly in mind is absurd.  As always&#x97;but <em>especially</em> in the context of strident, partisan legislative conflict of the sort that characterized enactment of this legislation&#x97;the language of the statute that was actually passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President is our only authoritative and only reliable guidepost.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A final but powerful indication of the fact that the Court has made a mess of this statute is the nature of the consequences that ensue.  Though this case concerns a habeas application challenging a trial by military commission, DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(1) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider <em>any</em> &#x93;application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  The vast majority of pending petitions, no doubt, do not relate to military commissions at all, but to more commonly challenged aspects of &#x93;detention&#x94; such as the terms and conditions of confinement.  See <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/466" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 466</a>,

 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  The Solicitor General represents that &#x93;[h]abeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a purported 600 [Guantanamo Bay] detainees,&#x94; including one that &#x93;seek[s] relief on behalf of every Guantanamo detainee who has not already filed an action,&#x94; Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 20, n. 10 (hereinafter Motion to Dismiss).  The Court&#x92;s interpretation transforms a provision abolishing jurisdiction over <em>all</em> Guantanamo-related habeas petitions into a provision that retains jurisdiction over cases sufficiently numerous to keep the courts busy for years to come.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Because I would hold that &#xA7;1005(e)(1) unambiguously terminates the jurisdiction of all courts to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; pending habeas applications, I must confront petitioner&#x92;s arguments that the provision, so interpreted, violates the Suspension Clause.  This claim is easily dispatched.  We stated in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/339/763" class="subref" title="subref">339 U. S. 763</a>,

:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;We are cited to no instance where a court, in this or any other country where the writ is known, has issued it on behalf of an alien enemy who, at no relevant time and in no stage of his captivity, has been within its territorial jurisdiction.  Nothing in the text of the Constitution extends such a right, nor does anything in our statutes.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Notwithstanding the ill-considered dicta in the Court&#x92;s opinion in <em>Rasul</em>, 542 U. S., at 480&#x96;481, it is clear that Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is outside the sovereign &#x93;territorial jurisdiction&#x94; of the United States.  See <em>id.</em>, at 500&#x96;505 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  Petitioner, an enemy alien detained abroad, has no rights under the Suspension Clause.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But even if petitioner were fully protected by the Clause, the DTA would create no suspension problem.  This Court has repeatedly acknowledged that &#x93;the substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person&#x92;s detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.&#x94;  <em>Swain</em> v. <em>Pressley</em>,

 (&#x93;Congress could, without raising any constitutional questions, provide an adequate substitute through the courts of appeals&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner has made no showing that the postdecision exclusive review by the D. C. Circuit provided in &#xA7;1005(e)(3) is inadequate to test the legality of his trial by military commission.  His principal argument is that the exclusive-review provisions are inadequate because they foreclose review of the claims he raises here.  Though petitioner&#x92;s brief does not parse the statutory language, his argument evidently rests on an erroneously narrow reading of DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  That provision grants the D. C. Circuit authority to review, &#x93;to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.&#x94;  In the quoted text, the phrase &#x93;such standards and procedures&#x94; refers to &#x93;the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (A),&#x94; namely &#x93;Military Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).&#x94;  DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(i), (e)(3)(A), <em>ibid</em>.  This Military Commission Order (Order No. 1) is the Department of Defense&#x92;s fundamental implementing order for the President&#x92;s order authorizing trials by military commission.  Order No. 1 establishes commissions, &#xA7;2; delineates their jurisdiction, &#xA7;3; provides for their officers, &#xA7;4(A); provides for their prosecution and defense counsel, &#xA7;4(B), (C); lays out all their procedures, both pretrial and trial, &#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P), &#xA7;6(A)&#x96;(G); and provides for posttrial military review through the Secretary of Defense and the President, &#xA7;6(H).  In short, the &#x93;standards and procedures specified in&#x94; Order No. 1 include <em>every aspect</em> of the military commissions, including the fact of their existence and every respect in which they differ from courts-martial.  Petitioner&#x92;s claims that the President lacks legal authority to try him before a military commission constitute claims that &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures,&#x94; as specified in Order No. 1, is &#x93;[in]consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  The D. C. Circuit thus retains jurisdiction to consider these claims on postdecision review, and the Government does not dispute that the DTA leaves unaffected our certiorari jurisdiction under

Thus, the DTA merely <em>defers</em> our jurisdiction to consider petitioner&#x92;s claims; it does not eliminate that jurisdiction.  It constitutes neither an &#x93;inadequate&#x94; nor an &#x93;ineffective&#x94; substitute for petitioner&#x92;s pending habeas application.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Though it does not squarely address the issue, the Court hints ominously that &#x93;the Government&#x92;s preferred reading&#x94; would &#x93;rais[e] grave questions about Congress&#x92; authority to impinge upon this Court&#x92;s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 10&#x96;11 (citing <em>Ex parte Yerger</em>, 
8Wall.
85 (1869); <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin</em>,

It is not clear how there could be any such lurking questions, in light of the aptly named &#x93;<em>Exceptions</em> Clause&#x94; of Article III, &#xA7;2, which, in making our appellate jurisdiction subject to &#x93;such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make,&#x94; explicitly permits exactly what Congress has done here.  But any doubt our prior cases might have created on this score is surely chimerical in <em>this</em> case.  As just noted, the exclusive-review provisions provide a substitute for habeas review adequate to satisfy the Suspension Clause, which <em>forbids</em> the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.  <em>A fortiori</em> they provide a substitute adequate to satisfy any implied substantive limitations, whether real or imaginary, upon the Exceptions Clause, which <em>authorizes</em> such exceptions as &#xA7;1005(e)(1).</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if Congress had not clearly and constitutionally eliminated jurisdiction over this case, neither this Court nor the lower courts ought to exercise it.  Traditionally, equitable principles govern both the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and the granting of the injunctive relief sought by petitioner.  See <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">311</a> (1982)
.  In light of Congress&#x92;s provision of an alternate avenue for petitioner&#x92;s claims in &#xA7;1005(e)(3), those equitable principles counsel that we abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In requesting abstention, the Government relies principally on <em>Councilman</em>, in which we abstained from considering a serviceman&#x92;s claim that his charge for marijuana possession was not sufficiently &#x93;service-connected&#x94; to trigger the subject-matter jurisdiction of the military courts-martial.  See 420 U. S., at 740, 758.  Admittedly, <em>Councilman</em> does not squarely control petitioner&#x92;s case, but it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence.  As the Court describes, <em>ante</em>, at 21, <em>Councilman</em> &#x93;identifie[d] two considerations of comity that together favor[ed] abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings against service personnel.&#x94;  But the Court errs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this case.  Both of them, and a third consideration not emphasized in <em>Councilman</em>, all cut in favor of abstention here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, the Court observes that <em>Councilman</em> rested in part on the fact that &#x93;military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts,&#x94; and concludes that &#x93;Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  This is true enough.  But for some reason, the Court fails to make any inquiry into whether military commission trials might involve <em>other</em> &#x93;military necessities&#x94; or &#x93;unique military exigencies,&#x94; 420 U. S., at 757, comparable in gravity to those at stake in <em>Councilman</em>.  To put this in context: The charge against the respondent in <em>Councilman</em> was the off-base possession and sale of marijuana while he was stationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, see <em>id.,</em> at 739&#x96;740.  The charge against the petitioner here is joining and actively abetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thousands of innocent American civilians without warning on September 11, 2001.  While <em>Councilman</em> held that the prosecution of the former charge involved &#x93;military necessities&#x94; counseling against our interference, the Court <em>does not even ponder the same question</em> for the latter charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The reason for the Court&#x92;s &#x93;blinkered study&#x94; of this question, <em>ante</em>, at 19, is not hard to fathom.  The principal opinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe that the trials by military commission involve any &#x93;military necessity&#x94; <em>at all:</em> &#x93;The charge&#x92;s shortcomings &#x2026; are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition &#x2026; for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 48.  This is quite at odds with the views on this subject expressed by our political branches.  Because of &#x93;military necessity,&#x94; a joint session of Congress authorized the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force,&#x94; including military commissions, &#x93;against those nations, organizations, or persons [such as petitioner] he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force, &#xA7;2(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224, note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1541.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. &#xA7;1541</a> (2000 ed., Supp. III).  In keeping with this authority, the President has determined that &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order &#x2026; to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 2001, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e) (2002).  It is not clear where the Court derives the authority&#x97;or the audacity&#x97;to contradict this determination.  If &#x93;military necessities&#x94; relating to &#x93;duty&#x94; and &#x93;discipline&#x94; required abstention in <em>Councilman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 757, military necessities relating to the disabling, deterrence, and punishment of the mass-murdering terrorists of September 11 require abstention all the more here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court further seeks to distinguish <em>Councilman</em> on the ground that &#x93;the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  To be sure, <em>Councilman</em> emphasized that &#x93;Congress created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion, who would gain over time thorough familiarity with military problems.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 758 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).  The Court contrasts this &#x93;integrated system&#x94; insulated from military influence with the review scheme established by Order No. 1, which &#x93;provides that appeal of a review panel&#x92;s decision may be had only to the Secretary of Defense himself, &#xA7;6(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, &#xA7;6(H)(6).&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if we were to accept the Court&#x92;s extraordinary assumption that the President &#x93;lack[s] the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 23,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

            </a> the Court&#x92;s description of the review scheme here is anachronistic.  As of December 30, 2005, the &#x93;fina[l]&#x94; review of decisions by military commissions is now conducted by the D. C. Circuit pursuant to &#xA7;1005(e)(3) of the DTA, and by this Court under

                    <b>9</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  At the time we decided <em>Councilman</em>, Congress had not &#x93;conferred on any Art[icle] III court jurisdiction directly to review court-martial determinations.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 746.  The final arbiter of direct appeals was the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), an Article I court whose members possessed neither life tenure, nor salary protection, nor the constitutional protection from removal provided to federal judges in Article III, &#xA7;1.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/867.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;867(a)(2)</a> (1970 ed.).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Moreover, a third consideration counsels strongly in favor of abstention in this case.  <em>Councilman</em> reasoned that the &#x93;considerations of comity, the necessity of respect for coordinate judicial systems&#x94; that motivated our decision in <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
, were inapplicable to courts-martial, because &#x93;the particular demands of federalism are not implicated.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 756, 757.  Though military commissions likewise do not implicate &#x93;the particular demands of federalism,&#x94; considerations of <em>interbranch</em> comity at the federal level weigh heavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case.  Here, apparently for the first time in history, see Motion to Dismiss 6, a District Court enjoined ongoing military commission proceedings, which had been deemed &#x93;necessary&#x94; by the President &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e).  Such an order brings the Judicial Branch into direct conflict with the Executive in an area where the Executive&#x92;s competence is maximal and ours is virtually nonexistent.  We should exercise our equitable discretion to <em>avoid</em> such conflict.  Instead, the Court rushes headlong to meet it.  Elsewhere, we have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state courts have &#x93;the first opportunity to review&#x94; a petitioner&#x92;s claim, merely to &#x93;reduc[e] friction between the state and federal court systems.&#x94;  <em>O&#x92;Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/526/838" class="subref" title="subref">526 U. S. 838</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">845</a> (1999)
.  The &#x93;friction&#x94; created today between this Court and the Executive Branch is many times more serious.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the face of such concerns, the Court relies heavily on <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/1" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 1</a> (1942)
: &#x93;Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, [in <em>Quirin</em>] we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  It is likely that the Government in <em>Quirin</em>, unlike here, preferred a hasty resolution of the case in this Court, so that it could swiftly execute the sentences imposed, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/507" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 507</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">569</a> (2004)
 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J</span>., dissenting).  But the Court&#x92;s reliance on <em>Quirin</em> suffers from a more fundamental defect: Once again, it ignores the DTA, which creates an avenue for the consideration of petitioner&#x92;s claims that did not exist at the time of <em>Quirin</em>.  Collateral application for habeas review was the <em>only</em> vehicle available.  And there was no compelling reason to postpone consideration of the <em>Quirin</em> application until the termination of military proceedings, because the only cognizable claims presented were general challenges to the authority of the commissions that would not be affected by the specific proceedings.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8&#x96;9, n. 2.  In the DTA, by contrast, Congress has expanded the scope of Article III review and has channeled it exclusively through a single, postverdict appeal to Article III courts.  Because Congress has created a novel unitary scheme of Article III review of military commissions that was absent in 1942, <em>Quirin</em> is no longer governing precedent.</p>

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-1" href="#ZD-1ref">1</a> The Court apparently believes that the effective-date provision means nothing at all.  &#x93;That paragraph (1), along with paragraphs (2) and (3), is to &#x91;take effect on the date of enactment,&#x92; DTA &#xA7;1005(h)(1),

, to the effect that &#x93;a statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.&#x94;  Ante, at 14, n. 9 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).  But this quote merely restates the obvious: An effective-date provision does not render a statute applicable to &#x93;conduct that occurred at an earlier date,&#x94; but of course it renders the statute applicable to conduct that occurs on the effective date and all future dates&#x97;such as the Court&#x92;s exercise of jurisdiction here.  The Court seems to suggest that, because the effective-date provision does not authorize retroactive application, it also fails to authorize prospective application (and is thus useless verbiage).  This cannot be true.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-2" href="#ZD-2ref">2</a> A comparison with Lindh v. Murphy, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, shows this not to be true.  Subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) of &#xA7;1005 resemble the provisions of AEDPA at issue in Lindh (whose retroactivityas applied to pending cases the Lindh majority did not rule upon,see 521 U. S., at 326), in that they &#x93;g[o] beyond &#x91;mere&#x92; procedure,&#x94;id., at 327.  They impose novel and unprecedented disabilities onthe Executive Branch in its conduct of military affairs.  Subsection (e)(2) imposes judicial review on the Combatant Status ReviewTribunals (CSRTs), whose implementing order did not subject themto review by Article III courts. See Memorandum from Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz re: Order Establishing Com-batant Status Review Tribunals, at 3 &#xA7;h (July 7, 2004), avail-able at http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040707review.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 27, 2006, and availablein Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  Subsection (e)(3) authorizes the D. C. Circuit to review &#x93;the validity of any final decision rendered pursuant to Military Commission Order No. 1,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(A), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743. Historically, federal courts have never reviewed the validity of the final decision of any military commission; their jurisdiction has been restricted to considering the commission&#x92;s &#x93;lawful authority to hear, decide and condemn,&#x94;  In re Yamashita,

.  Thus, contrary to the Court&#x92;s suggestion, ante, at 17, subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) confer new jurisdiction: They impose judicial oversight on a traditionally unreviewable exercise of military authority by the Commander in Chief.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-9" href="#ZD-9ref">9</a> In rejecting our analysis, the Court observes that appeals to the D. C.

2743.  The relevance of this observation to the abstention question is unfathomable.  The fact that Article III review is discretionary does not mean that it lacks &#x93;structural insulation from military influence,&#x94; ante, at 23, and its discretionary nature presents no obstacle to the courts&#x92; future review these cases.


The Court might more cogently have relied on the discretionary nature of review to argue that the statute provides an inadequate substitute for habeas review under the Suspension Clause.  See supra, at 16&#x96;18.  But this argument would have no force, even if all appeals to the D. C. Circuit were discretionary.  The exercise of habeas jurisdiction has traditionally been entirely a matter of the court&#x92;s equitable discretion, see Withrow v. Williams,

        <p class="bodytext">    On December 30, 2005, Congress enacted the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA).  It unambiguously provides that, as of that date, &#x93;no court, justice, or judge&#x94; shall have jurisdiction to consider the habeas application of a Guantanamo Bay detainee.  Notwithstanding this plain directive, the Court today concludes that, on what it calls the statute&#x92;s <em>most natural</em> reading, <em>every</em> &#x93;court, justice, or judge&#x94; before whom such a habeas application was pending on December 30 has jurisdiction to hear, consider, and render judgment on it.  This conclusion is patently erroneous.  And even if it were not, the jurisdiction supposedly retained should, in an exercise of sound equitable discretion, not be exercised.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The DTA provides: &#x93;[N]o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742 (internal division omitted).  This provision &#x93;t[ook] effect on the date of the enactment of this Act,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(h)(1), <em>id.</em>, at 2743, which was December 30, 2005.  As of that date, then, <em>no</em> court had jurisdiction to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; the merits of petitioner&#x92;s habeas application.  This repeal of jurisdiction is simply not ambiguous as between pending and future cases.  It prohibits <em>any</em> exercise of jurisdiction, and it became effective as to <em>all</em> cases last December 30.  It is also perfectly clear that the phrase &#x93;no court, <em>justice</em>, or judge&#x94; includes this Court and its Members, and that by exercising our appellate jurisdiction in this case we are &#x93;hear[ing] or consider[ing] &#x2026; an application for a writ of habeas<span class="softbreak"/>corpus.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that statutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases pending at their effective date.  For example, in <em>Bruner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/343/112" class="subref" title="subref">343 U. S. 112</a> (1952)
, we granted certiorari to consider whether the Tucker Act&#x92;s provision denying district court jurisdiction over suits by &#x93;officers&#x94; of the United States barred a suit by an <em>employee</em> of the United States.  After we granted certiorari, Congress amended the Tucker Act by adding suits by &#x93; &#x91;employees&#x92; &#x94; to the provision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 114.  This statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district courts &#x93;became effective&#x94; while the case was pending before us, <em>ibid.</em>, and made no explicit reference to pending cases.  Because the statute &#x93;did not reserve jurisdiction over pending cases,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 115, we held that it clearly ousted jurisdiction over them.  Summarizing centuries of practice, we said: &#x93;This rule&#x97;that, when a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to pending cases, all cases fall with the law&#x97;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 116&#x96;117.  See also <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products</em>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">274</a> (1994)
 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>) (&#x93;We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction terminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not, as today&#x92;s opinion for the Court would have it, a judge-made &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11, that we have invented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes.  It is simple recognition of the reality that the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.  <em>And this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To alter this plain meaning, our cases have required an explicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdiction-repealing statute.  For example, <em>Bruner</em>, as mentioned, looked to whether Congress made &#x93;any reservation as to pending cases.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117; see also <em>id.</em>, at 115 (&#x93;Congress made no provision for cases pending at the effective date of the Act withdrawing jurisdiction and, for this reason, Courts of Appeals ordered pending cases terminated for want of jurisdiction&#x94;).  Likewise, in <em>Hallowell</em> v. <em>Commons</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/239/506" class="subref" title="subref">239 U. S. 506</a> (1916)
, Justice Holmes relied on the fact that the jurisdiction-ousting provision &#x93;made no exception for pending litigation, but purported to be universal,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 508.  And in <em>Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Ritchie</em>, 
5Wall.
541 (1867), we again relied on the fact that the jurisdictional repeal was made &#x93;without any saving of such causes as that before us,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 544.  As in <em>Bruner</em>, <em>Hallowell</em>, and <em>Ritchie</em>, the DTA&#x92;s directive that &#x93;no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742, is made &#x93;without any reservation as to pending cases&#x94; and &#x93;purport[s] to be universal.&#x94;  What we stated in an earlier case remains true here: &#x93;[W]hen, if it had been the intention to confine the operation of [the jurisdictional repeal] &#x2026; to cases not pending, it would have been so easy to have said so, we must presume that Congress meant the language employed should have its usual and ordinary signification, and that the old law should be unconditionally repealed.&#x94;  <em>Railroad Co.</em> v. <em>Grant</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/98/398" class="subref" title="subref">98 U. S. 398</a>,

.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court claims that I &#x93;rea[d] too much into&#x94; the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases, <em>ante</em>, at 12, n. 7, and that &#x93;the <em>Bruner</em> rule&#x94; has never been &#x93;an inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19.  But the Court sorely misdescribes <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;as if it were a kind of early-day <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, resolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative inference.  On the contrary, as described above, <em>Bruner</em> stated its holding as an unqualified &#x93;rule,&#x94; which &#x93;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117.  Though <em>Bruner</em> referred to an express savings clause elsewhere in the statute, <em>id.,</em> at 115, n. 7, it disavowed any reliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain meaning, quoting <em>Ritchie</em> at length: &#x93; &#x91;It is quite possible that this effect of the [jurisdiction-stripping statute] was not contemplated by Congress&#x2026; .  [B]ut when terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention.&#x92; &#x94;  343 U. S., at 116 (quoting 5 Wall., at 544&#x96;545).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court also attempts to evade the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases by asserting that &#x93;the &#x91;presumption&#x92; [of application to pending cases] that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption&#x97;viz., the presumption against retroactivity&#x97;in certain limited circumstances.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  I have already explained that what the Court calls a &#x93;presumption&#x94; is simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous meaning of such provisions.  But even taking it to be what the Court says, the effect upon the present case would be the same.  <em>Prospective</em> applications of a statute are &#x93;effective&#x94; upon the statute&#x92;s effective date; that is what an effective-date provision like &#xA7;1005(h)(1) <em>means</em>.<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

            </a>  &#x93; &#x91;[S]hall take effect upon enactment&#x92; is presumed to mean &#x91;shall have prospective effect upon enactment,&#x92; and that presumption is too strong to be overcome by any negative inference [drawn from other provisions of the statute].&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 288 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, concurring in judgments).  The Court&#x92;s &#x93;nonapplication of &#x2026; the presumption against retroactivity&#x94; to &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is thus just another way of stating that the statute takes immediate effect in pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Though the Court resists the <em>Bruner</em> rule, it cannot cite a<em> single case</em> in the history of Anglo-American law (before today) in which a jurisdiction-stripping provision was denied immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation.  By contrast, the cases granting such immediate effect are legion, and they repeatedly rely on the plain language of the jurisdictional repeal as an &#x93;inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19, by requiring an express reservation to save pending cases.

        <p class="bodytext">    Disregarding the plain meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the requirement of explicit exception set forth in the foregoing cases, the Court instead favors &#x93;a negative inference &#x2026; from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 13.  Specifically, it appeals to the fact that &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) are explicitly made applicable to pending cases (by &#xA7;1005(h)(2)).  A negative inference of the sort the Court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an ambiguous provision, but since the meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear, the omitted language in that context would have been redundant.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if &#xA7;1005(e)(1) were at all ambiguous in its application to pending cases, the &#x93;negative inference&#x94; from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) touted by the Court would have no force.  The numerous cases in the <em>Bruner</em> line would at least create a powerful default &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11.  The negative inference urged by the Court would be a particularly awkward and indirect way of rebutting such a longstanding and consistent practice.  This is especially true since the negative inference that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(h)(2)&#x92;s specification that certain provisions <em>shall</em> apply to pending cases is matched by a negative inference in the opposite direction that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(b)(2), which provides that certain provisions shall <em>not </em>apply to pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court&#x92;s reliance on our opinion in <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, is utterly misplaced.  <em>Lindh</em> involved two provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA): a set of amendments to chapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined the scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts; and a provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas statute specially to govern federal collateral review of state capital cases.  See 521 U. S., at 326&#x96;327.  The latter provision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applicable to cases pending at the time of AEDPA&#x92;s enactment; the former made no specific reference to pending cases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 327.  In <em>Lindh</em>, we drew a negative inference from chapter 154&#x92;s explicit reference to pending cases, to conclude that the chapter 153 amendments did <em>not</em> apply in pending cases.  It was essential to our reasoning, however, that both provisions appeared to be <em>identically difficult</em> to classify under our retroactivity cases.  First, we noted that, after <em>Landgraf</em>, there was reason for Congress to suppose that an explicit statement was required to render the amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending cases, because the new chapter 154 &#x93;will have substantive as well as purely procedural effects.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 327.  The next step&#x97;and the critical step&#x97;in our reasoning was that Congress had <em>identical</em> reason to suppose that an explicit statement would be required to apply the chapter 153 amendments to pending cases, but did not provide it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  The negative inference of <em>Lindh</em> rested on the fact that &#x93;[n]othing &#x2026; but a different intent explain[ed] the different treatment.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Here, by contrast, there is ample reason for the different treatment.  The exclusive-review provisions of the DTA, unlike both &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the AEDPA amendments in <em>Lindh</em>, confer <em>new</em> jurisdiction (in the D. C. Circuit)  where there was none before.  For better or for worse, our recent cases have contrasted jurisdiction-<em>creating</em> provisions with jurisdiction-<em>ousting</em> provisions, retaining the venerable rule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied in pending cases, but strongly indicating that the former are typically retroactive.  For example, we stated in <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)
, that a statute &#x93;that <em>creates</em> jurisdiction where none previously existed&#x94; is &#x93;as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other.&#x94;  See also <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>,

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J</span>.); <em>id.</em>, at 722 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy</span>, J., dissenting).  The Court gives our retroactivity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that &#x93;subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents.&#x94;<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            <em>Ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18.  This statement rises to the level of sarcasm when one considers its author&#x92;s description of the governing test of our retroactivity jurisprudence:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The conclusion that a particular rule operates &#x91;retroactively&#x92; comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.  Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.  However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have &#x91;sound &#x2026; instinct[s],&#x92; &#x2026; and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 270 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The only &#x93;familiar consideration,&#x94; &#x93;reasonable reliance,&#x94; and &#x93;settled expectation&#x94; I am aware of pertaining to the present case is the rule of <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;applicable to &#xA7;1005(e)(1), but not to &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)&#x97;which the Court stubbornly disregards.  It is utterly beyond question that &#xA7;1005(e)(2)&#x92;s and (3)&#x92;s application to pending cases (without explicit specification) was not as clear as &#xA7;1005(e)(1)&#x92;s.  That is alone enough to explain the difference in treatment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Another obvious reason for the specification was to stave off any Suspension Clause problems raised by the immediately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by subsection (e)(1).  That is to say, specification of the immediate effectiveness of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) (which, unlike subsection (e)(1), would not fall within the <em>Bruner </em>rule and would not <em>automatically</em> be deemed applicable in pending cases) could reasonably have been thought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas jurisdiction that subsection (e)(1) eliminated in pending cases with an adequate substitute.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These considerations by no means prove that an explicit statement would be <em>required</em> to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable in pending cases.  But they surely gave Congress ample reason to <em>doubt</em> that their application in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the Court glibly assumes.  In any event, even if it were true that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x93; &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18, this would merely establish that subsection (h)(2)&#x92;s reference to pending cases was wholly superfluous when applied to subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3), just as it would have been for subsection (e)(1).  <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference makes sense only when Congress would have perceived &#x93;the wisdom of being explicit&#x94; with respect to the immediate application of <em>both</em> of two statutory provisions, 521 U. S., at 328, but chose to be explicit only for one of them&#x97;not when it would have perceived <em>no need </em>to be explicit for both, but enacted a redundancy only for one.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, it is simply untrue that Congress &#x93; &#x91;should have been just as concerned about&#x92; &#x94; specifying the application of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) to pending cases, <em>ante</em>, at 14 (quoting <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329).  In fact, the negative-inference approach of <em>Lindh</em> is particularly inappropriate in this case, because the negative inference from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) would tend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that <em>are</em> explicitly rendered applicable in pending cases, &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3).  Those provisions purport to vest &#x93;exclusive&#x94; jurisdiction in the D. C. Circuit to consider the claims raised by petitioners here.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.  By drawing a negative inference <em>&lt;fs fs="11.5"&gt;&amp;Agrave;</em>
            <em>la</em>
            <em>Lindh</em>, the Court supplants this exclusive-review mechanism with a dual-review mechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to file applications challenging the CSRTs or military commissions before December 30, 2005.  Whatever the force of <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference in other cases, it surely should not apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision from which the negative inference is drawn.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Worst of all is the Court&#x92;s reliance on the legislative history of the DTA to buttress its implausible reading of &#xA7;1005(e)(1).  We have repeatedly held that such reliance is impermissible where, as here, the statutory language is unambiguous.  But the Court nevertheless relies both on floor statements from the Senate and (quite heavily) on the drafting history of the DTA.  To begin with floor statements: The Court urges that some &#x93;statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to&#x94; the Court&#x92;s interpretation, citing excerpts from the floor debate that support its view, <em>ante</em>, 15&#x96;16, n. 10.  The Court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor statements by the DTA&#x92;s sponsors that flatly contradict its view, because &#x93;those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record <em>after</em> the Senate debate.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Of course this observation, even if true, makes no difference unless one indulges the fantasy that Senate floor speeches are attended (like the Philippics of Demosthenes) by throngs of eager listeners, instead of being delivered (like Demosthenes&#x92; practice sessions on the beach) alone into a vast emptiness.  Whether the floor statements are spoken where no Senator hears, or written where no Senator reads, they represent at most the views of a single Senator.  In any event, the Court greatly exaggerates the one-sidedness of the portions of the floor debate that clearly occurred before the DTA&#x92;s enactment.  Some of the statements of Senator Graham, a sponsor of the bill, only make sense on the assumption that pending cases are covered.<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    But selectivity is not the greatest vice in the Court&#x92;s use of floor statements to resolve today&#x92;s case.  These statements were made when Members of Congress were fully aware that our continuing jurisdiction <em>over this very case</em> was at issue.  The question was divisive, and floor statements made on both sides were undoubtedly opportunistic and crafted <em>solely</em> for use in the briefs in this very litigation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 151 Cong. Rec. S14257&#x96;S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen. Levin) (arguing against a reading that would &#x93;stri[p] the Federal courts of jurisdiction to consider pending cases, <em>including the Hamdan case now pending in the Supreme Court</em>,&#x94; and urging that <em>Lindh</em> requires the same negative inference that the Court indulges today (emphasis added)).  The Court&#x92;s reliance on such statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar opportunism.  In a virtually identical context, the author of today&#x92;s opinion has written for the Court that &#x93;[t]he legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 262 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).  Likewise, the handful of floor statements that the Court treats as authoritative do not &#x93;reflec[t] any general agreement.&#x94;  They reflect the now-common tactic&#x97;which the Court once again rewards&#x97;of pursuing through floor-speech <em>ipse dixit</em> what could not be achieved through the constitutionally prescribed method of putting language into a bill that a majority of both Houses vote for and the President signs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the floor statements, at least the Court shows some semblance of seemly shame, tucking away its reference to them in a half-hearted footnote.  Not so for its reliance on the DTA&#x92;s drafting history, which is displayed prominently, see <em>ante</em>, at 14&#x96;15.  I have explained elsewhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or reliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute than any other form of legislative history.  This case presents a textbook example of its unreliability.  The Court, <em>ante</em>, at 14, trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the Senate included redundant language, not included in the DTA as passed, reconfirming that the abolition of habeas jurisdiction &#x93;shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.&#x94;  151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005).  But this earlier version of the bill also differed from the DTA in other material respects.  Most notably, it provided for postdecision review by the D. C. Circuit only of the decisions of <em>CSRTs</em>, not military commissions, <em>ibid.; </em>and it limited that review to whether &#x93;the status determination &#x2026; was consistent with the procedures and standards specified by the Secretary of Defense,&#x94; <em>ibid.,</em> not whether &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures &#x2026; is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742.  To say that what moved Senators to reject this earlier bill was the &#x93;action that is pending&#x94; provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even this Court&#x92;s greatest Justices.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

                    <b>6</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  And to think that the House and the President also had this rejection firmly in mind is absurd.  As always&#x97;but <em>especially</em> in the context of strident, partisan legislative conflict of the sort that characterized enactment of this legislation&#x97;the language of the statute that was actually passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President is our only authoritative and only reliable guidepost.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A final but powerful indication of the fact that the Court has made a mess of this statute is the nature of the consequences that ensue.  Though this case concerns a habeas application challenging a trial by military commission, DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(1) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider <em>any</em> &#x93;application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  The vast majority of pending petitions, no doubt, do not relate to military commissions at all, but to more commonly challenged aspects of &#x93;detention&#x94; such as the terms and conditions of confinement.  See <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/466" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 466</a>,

 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  The Solicitor General represents that &#x93;[h]abeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a purported 600 [Guantanamo Bay] detainees,&#x94; including one that &#x93;seek[s] relief on behalf of every Guantanamo detainee who has not already filed an action,&#x94; Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 20, n. 10 (hereinafter Motion to Dismiss).  The Court&#x92;s interpretation transforms a provision abolishing jurisdiction over <em>all</em> Guantanamo-related habeas petitions into a provision that retains jurisdiction over cases sufficiently numerous to keep the courts busy for years to come.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Because I would hold that &#xA7;1005(e)(1) unambiguously terminates the jurisdiction of all courts to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; pending habeas applications, I must confront petitioner&#x92;s arguments that the provision, so interpreted, violates the Suspension Clause.  This claim is easily dispatched.  We stated in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">
Notwithstanding the ill-considered dicta in the Court&#x92;s opinion in <em>Rasul</em>, 542 U.

 (&#x93;Congress could, without raising any constitutional questions, provide an adequate substitute through the courts of appeals&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner has made no showing that the postdecision exclusive review by the D. C. Circuit provided in &#xA7;1005(e)(3) is inadequate to test the legality of his trial by military commission.  His principal argument is that the exclusive-review provisions are inadequate because they foreclose review of the claims he raises here.  Though petitioner&#x92;s brief does not parse the statutory language, his argument evidently rests on an erroneously narrow reading of DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  That provision grants the D. C. Circuit authority to review, &#x93;to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.&#x94;  In the quoted text, the phrase &#x93;such standards and procedures&#x94; refers to &#x93;the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (A),&#x94; namely &#x93;Military Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).&#x94;  DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(i), (e)(3)(A), <em>ibid</em>.  This Military Commission Order (Order No. 1) is the Department of Defense&#x92;s fundamental implementing order for the President&#x92;s order authorizing trials by military commission.  Order No. 1 establishes commissions, &#xA7;2; delineates their jurisdiction, &#xA7;3; provides for their officers, &#xA7;4(A); provides for their prosecution and defense counsel, &#xA7;4(B), (C); lays out all their procedures, both pretrial and trial, &#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P), &#xA7;6(A)&#x96;(G); and provides for posttrial military review through the Secretary of Defense and the President, &#xA7;6(H).  In short, the &#x93;standards and procedures specified in&#x94; Order No. 1 include <em>every aspect</em> of the military commissions, including the fact of their existence and every respect in which they differ from courts-martial.  Petitioner&#x92;s claims that the President lacks legal authority to try him before a military commission constitute claims that &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures,&#x94; as specified in Order No. 1, is &#x93;[in]consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  The D. C. Circuit thus retains jurisdiction to consider these claims on postdecision review, and the Government does not dispute that the DTA leaves unaffected our certiorari jurisdiction under

Thus, the DTA merely <em>defers</em> our jurisdiction to consider petitioner&#x92;s claims; it does not eliminate that jurisdiction.

As just noted, the exclusive-review provisions provide a substitute for habeas review adequate to satisfy the Suspension Clause, which <em>forbids</em> the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.  <em>A fortiori</em> they provide a substitute adequate to satisfy any implied substantive limitations, whether real or imaginary, upon the Exceptions Clause, which <em>authorizes</em> such exceptions as &#xA7;1005(e)(1).</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if Congress had not clearly and constitutionally eliminated jurisdiction over this case, neither this Court nor the lower courts ought to exercise it.  Traditionally, equitable principles govern both the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and the granting of the injunctive relief sought by petitioner.  See <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">311</a> (1982)
.  In light of Congress&#x92;s provision of an alternate avenue for petitioner&#x92;s claims in &#xA7;1005(e)(3), those equitable principles counsel that we abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In requesting abstention, the Government relies principally on <em>Councilman</em>, in which we abstained from considering a serviceman&#x92;s claim that his charge for marijuana possession was not sufficiently &#x93;service-connected&#x94; to trigger the subject-matter jurisdiction of the military courts-martial.  See 420 U. S., at 740, 758.  Admittedly, <em>Councilman</em> does not squarely control petitioner&#x92;s case, but it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence.  As the Court describes, <em>ante</em>, at 21, <em>Councilman</em> &#x93;identifie[d] two considerations of comity that together favor[ed] abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings against service personnel.&#x94;  But the Court errs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this case.  Both of them, and a third consideration not emphasized in <em>Councilman</em>, all cut in favor of abstention here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, the Court observes that <em>Councilman</em> rested in part on the fact that &#x93;military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts,&#x94; and concludes that &#x93;Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  This is true enough.  But for some reason, the Court fails to make any inquiry into whether military commission trials might involve <em>other</em> &#x93;military necessities&#x94; or &#x93;unique military exigencies,&#x94; 420 U. S., at 757, comparable in gravity to those at stake in <em>Councilman</em>.  To put this in context: The charge against the respondent in <em>Councilman</em> was the off-base possession and sale of marijuana while he was stationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, see <em>id.,</em> at 739&#x96;740.  The charge against the petitioner here is joining and actively abetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thousands of innocent American civilians without warning on September 11, 2001.  While <em>Councilman</em> held that the prosecution of the former charge involved &#x93;military necessities&#x94; counseling against our interference, the Court <em>does not even ponder the same question</em> for the latter charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The reason for the Court&#x92;s &#x93;blinkered study&#x94; of this question, <em>ante</em>, at 19, is not hard to fathom.  The principal opinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe that the trials by military commission involve any &#x93;military necessity&#x94; <em>at all:</em> &#x93;The charge&#x92;s shortcomings &#x2026; are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition &#x2026; for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 48.  This is quite at odds with the views on this subject expressed by our political branches.  Because of &#x93;military necessity,&#x94; a joint session of Congress authorized the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force,&#x94; including military commissions, &#x93;against those nations, organizations, or persons [such as petitioner] he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force, &#xA7;2(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224, note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1541.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. &#xA7;1541</a> (2000 ed., Supp. III).  In keeping with this authority, the President has determined that &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order &#x2026; to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 2001, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e) (2002).  It is not clear where the Court derives the authority&#x97;or the audacity&#x97;to contradict this determination.  If &#x93;military necessities&#x94; relating to &#x93;duty&#x94; and &#x93;discipline&#x94; required abstention in <em>Councilman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 757, military necessities relating to the disabling, deterrence, and punishment of the mass-murdering terrorists of September 11 require abstention all the more here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court further seeks to distinguish <em>Councilman</em> on the ground that &#x93;the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  To be sure, <em>Councilman</em> emphasized that &#x93;Congress created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion, who would gain over time thorough familiarity with military problems.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 758 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).  The Court contrasts this &#x93;integrated system&#x94; insulated from military influence with the review scheme established by Order No. 1, which &#x93;provides that appeal of a review panel&#x92;s decision may be had only to the Secretary of Defense himself, &#xA7;6(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, &#xA7;6(H)(6).&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if we were to accept the Court&#x92;s extraordinary assumption that the President &#x93;lack[s] the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 23,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

                </sup>
            </a> the Court&#x92;s description of the review scheme here is anachronistic.  As of December 30, 2005, the &#x93;fina[l]&#x94; review of decisions by military commissions is now conducted by the D. C. Circuit pursuant to &#xA7;1005(e)(3) of the DTA, and by this Court under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1254.html#1" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;1254(1)</a>.  This provision for review by Article III courts creates, if anything, a review scheme <em>more</em> insulated from Executive control than that in <em>Councilman</em>.<a name="ZD-9ref" href="#ZD-9" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>9</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  At the time we decided <em>Councilman</em>, Congress had not &#x93;conferred on any Art[icle] III court jurisdiction directly to review court-martial determinations.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 746.  The final arbiter of direct appeals was the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), an Article I court whose members possessed neither life tenure, nor salary protection, nor the constitutional protection from removal provided to federal judges in Article III, &#xA7;1.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/867.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;867(a)(2)</a> (1970 ed.).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Moreover, a third consideration counsels strongly in favor of abstention in this case.  <em>Councilman</em> reasoned that the &#x93;considerations of comity, the necessity of respect for coordinate judicial systems&#x94; that motivated our decision in <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
, were inapplicable to courts-martial, because &#x93;the particular demands of federalism are not implicated.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 756, 757.  Though military commissions likewise do not implicate &#x93;the particular demands of federalism,&#x94; considerations of <em>interbranch</em> comity at the federal level weigh heavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case.  Here, apparently for the first time in history, see Motion to Dismiss 6, a District Court enjoined ongoing military commission proceedings, which had been deemed &#x93;necessary&#x94; by the President &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e).  Such an order brings the Judicial Branch into direct conflict with the Executive in an area where the Executive&#x92;s competence is maximal and ours is virtually nonexistent.  We should exercise our equitable discretion to <em>avoid</em> such conflict.  Instead, the Court rushes headlong to meet it.  Elsewhere, we have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state courts have &#x93;the first opportunity to review&#x94; a petitioner&#x92;s claim, merely to &#x93;reduc[e] friction between the state and federal court systems.&#x94;  <em>O&#x92;Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/526/838" class="subref" title="subref">526 U. S. 838</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">844</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">845</a> (1999)
.  The &#x93;friction&#x94; created today between this Court and the Executive Branch is many times more serious.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the face of such concerns, the Court relies heavily on <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/1" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 1</a> (1942)
: &#x93;Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, [in <em>Quirin</em>] we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  It is likely that the Government in <em>Quirin</em>, unlike here, preferred a hasty resolution of the case in this Court, so that it could swiftly execute the sentences imposed, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/507" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 507</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">569</a> (2004)
 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J</span>., dissenting).  But the Court&#x92;s reliance on <em>Quirin</em> suffers from a more fundamental defect: Once again, it ignores the DTA, which creates an avenue for the consideration of petitioner&#x92;s claims that did not exist at the time of <em>Quirin</em>.  Collateral application for habeas review was the <em>only</em> vehicle available.  And there was no compelling reason to postpone consideration of the <em>Quirin</em> application until the termination of military proceedings, because the only cognizable claims presented were general challenges to the authority of the commissions that would not be affected by the specific proceedings.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8&#x96;9, n. 2.  In the DTA, by contrast, Congress has expanded the scope of Article III review and has channeled it exclusively through a single, postverdict appeal to Article III courts.  Because Congress has created a novel unitary scheme of Article III review of military commissions that was absent in 1942, <em>Quirin</em> is no longer governing precedent.</p>

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-1" href="#ZD-1ref">1</a> The Court apparently believes that the effective-date provision means nothing at all.  &#x93;That paragraph (1), along with paragraphs (2) and (3), is to &#x91;take effect on the date of enactment,&#x92; DTA &#xA7;1005(h)(1),

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">317</a> (2001)
, to the effect that &#x93;a statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.&#x94;  Ante, at 14, n. 9 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).  But this quote merely restates the obvious: An effective-date provision does not render a statute applicable to &#x93;conduct that occurred at an earlier date,&#x94; but of course it renders the statute applicable to conduct that occurs on the effective date and all future dates&#x97;such as the Court&#x92;s exercise of jurisdiction here.  The Court seems to suggest that, because the effective-date provision does not authorize retroactive application, it also fails to authorize prospective application (and is thus useless verbiage).  This cannot be true.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-2" href="#ZD-2ref">2</a> A comparison with Lindh v. Murphy, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, shows this not to be true.  Subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) of &#xA7;1005 resemble the provisions of AEDPA at issue in Lindh (whose retroactivityas applied to pending cases the Lindh majority did not rule upon,see 521 U. S., at 326), in that they &#x93;g[o] beyond &#x91;mere&#x92; procedure,&#x94;id., at 327.  They impose novel and unprecedented disabilities onthe Executive Branch in its conduct of military affairs.  Subsection (e)(2) imposes judicial review on the Combatant Status ReviewTribunals (CSRTs), whose implementing order did not subject themto review by Article III courts. See Memorandum from Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz re: Order Establishing Com-batant Status Review Tribunals, at 3 &#xA7;h (July 7, 2004), avail-able at http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040707review.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 27, 2006, and availablein Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  Subsection (e)(3) authorizes the D. C. Circuit to review &#x93;the validity of any final decision rendered pursuant to Military Commission Order No. 1,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(A), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743. Historically, federal courts have never reviewed the validity of the final decision of any military commission; their jurisdiction has been restricted to considering the commission&#x92;s &#x93;lawful authority to hear, decide and condemn,&#x94;  In re Yamashita, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/1" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 1</a>,

.  Thus, contrary to the Court&#x92;s suggestion, ante, at 17, subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) confer new jurisdiction: They impose judicial oversight on a traditionally unreviewable exercise of military authority by the Commander in Chief.  They arguably &#x93;spea[k] not just to the power of a particular court but to . . . substantive rights . . . as well,&#x94; Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Shumer,

2743.  The relevance of this observation to the abstention question is unfathomable.  The fact that Article III review is discretionary does not mean that it lacks &#x93;structural insulation from military influence,&#x94; ante, at 23, and its discretionary nature presents no obstacle to the courts&#x92; future review these cases.


The Court might more cogently have relied on the discretionary nature of review to argue that the statute provides an inadequate substitute for habeas review under the Suspension Clause.  See supra, at 16&#x96;18.  But this argument would have no force, even if all appeals to the D. C. Circuit were discretionary.  The exercise of habeas jurisdiction has traditionally been entirely a matter of the court&#x92;s equitable discretion, see Withrow v. Williams,

        <p class="bodytext">    On December 30, 2005, Congress enacted the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA).  It unambiguously provides that, as of that date, &#x93;no court, justice, or judge&#x94; shall have jurisdiction to consider the habeas application of a Guantanamo Bay detainee.  Notwithstanding this plain directive, the Court today concludes that, on what it calls the statute&#x92;s <em>most natural</em> reading, <em>every</em> &#x93;court, justice, or judge&#x94; before whom such a habeas application was pending on December 30 has jurisdiction to hear, consider, and render judgment on it.  This conclusion is patently erroneous.  And even if it were not, the jurisdiction supposedly retained should, in an exercise of sound equitable discretion, not be exercised.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">    The DTA provides: &#x93;[N]o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  &#xA7;1005(e)(1),

2742 (internal division omitted).  This provision &#x93;t[ook] effect on the date of the enactment of this Act,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(h)(1), <em>id.</em>, at 2743, which was December 30, 2005.  As of that date, then, <em>no</em> court had jurisdiction to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; the merits of petitioner&#x92;s habeas application.  This repeal of jurisdiction is simply not ambiguous as between pending and future cases.  It prohibits <em>any</em> exercise of jurisdiction, and it became effective as to <em>all</em> cases last December 30.  It is also perfectly clear that the phrase &#x93;no court, <em>justice</em>, or judge&#x94; includes this Court and its Members, and that by exercising our appellate jurisdiction in this case we are &#x93;hear[ing] or consider[ing] &#x2026; an application for a writ of habeas<span class="softbreak"/>corpus.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that statutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases pending at their effective date.  For example, in <em>Bruner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/343/112" class="subref" title="subref">343 U. S. 112</a> (1952)
, we granted certiorari to consider whether the Tucker Act&#x92;s provision denying district court jurisdiction over suits by &#x93;officers&#x94; of the United States barred a suit by an <em>employee</em> of the United States.  After we granted certiorari, Congress amended the Tucker Act by adding suits by &#x93; &#x91;employees&#x92; &#x94; to the provision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 114.  This statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district courts &#x93;became effective&#x94; while the case was pending before us, <em>ibid.</em>, and made no explicit reference to pending cases.  Because the statute &#x93;did not reserve jurisdiction over pending cases,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 115, we held that it clearly ousted jurisdiction over them.  Summarizing centuries of practice, we said: &#x93;This rule&#x97;that, when a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to pending cases, all cases fall with the law&#x97;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 116&#x96;117.

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>) (&#x93;We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction terminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not, as today&#x92;s opinion for the Court would have it, a judge-made &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11, that we have invented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes.  It is simple recognition of the reality that the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.  <em>And this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To alter this plain meaning, our cases have required an explicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdiction-repealing statute.  For example, <em>Bruner</em>, as mentioned, looked to whether Congress made &#x93;any reservation as to pending cases.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117; see also <em>id.</em>, at 115 (&#x93;Congress made no provision for cases pending at the effective date of the Act withdrawing jurisdiction and, for this reason, Courts of Appeals ordered pending cases terminated for want of jurisdiction&#x94;).  Likewise, in <em>Hallowell</em> v. <em>Commons</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/239/506" class="subref" title="subref">239 U. S. 506</a> (1916)
, Justice Holmes relied on the fact that the jurisdiction-ousting provision &#x93;made no exception for pending litigation, but purported to be universal,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 508.  And in <em>Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Ritchie</em>, 
5Wall.
541 (1867), we again relied on the fact that the jurisdictional repeal was made &#x93;without any saving of such causes as that before us,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 544.  As in <em>Bruner</em>, <em>Hallowell</em>, and <em>Ritchie</em>, the DTA&#x92;s directive that &#x93;no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742, is made &#x93;without any reservation as to pending cases&#x94; and &#x93;purport[s] to be universal.&#x94;  What we stated in an earlier case remains true here: &#x93;[W]hen, if it had been the intention to confine the operation of [the jurisdictional repeal] &#x2026; to cases not pending, it would have been so easy to have said so, we must presume that Congress meant the language employed should have its usual and ordinary signification, and that the old law should be unconditionally repealed.&#x94;  <em>Railroad Co.</em> v. <em>Grant</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    The Court claims that I &#x93;rea[d] too much into&#x94; the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases, <em>ante</em>, at 12, n. 7, and that &#x93;the <em>Bruner</em> rule&#x94; has never been &#x93;an inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19.  But the Court sorely misdescribes <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;as if it were a kind of early-day <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, resolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative inference.  On the contrary, as described above, <em>Bruner</em> stated its holding as an unqualified &#x93;rule,&#x94; which &#x93;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117.  Though <em>Bruner</em> referred to an express savings clause elsewhere in the statute, <em>id.,</em> at 115, n. 7, it disavowed any reliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain meaning, quoting <em>Ritchie</em> at length: &#x93; &#x91;It is quite possible that this effect of the [jurisdiction-stripping statute] was not contemplated by Congress&#x2026; .  [B]ut when terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention.&#x92; &#x94;  343 U. S., at 116 (quoting 5 Wall., at 544&#x96;545).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court also attempts to evade the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases by asserting that &#x93;the &#x91;presumption&#x92; [of application to pending cases] that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption&#x97;viz., the presumption against retroactivity&#x97;in certain limited circumstances.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  I have already explained that what the Court calls a &#x93;presumption&#x94; is simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous meaning of such provisions.  But even taking it to be what the Court says, the effect upon the present case would be the same.  <em>Prospective</em> applications of a statute are &#x93;effective&#x94; upon the statute&#x92;s effective date; that is what an effective-date provision like &#xA7;1005(h)(1) <em>means</em>.<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

            </a>  &#x93; &#x91;[S]hall take effect upon enactment&#x92; is presumed to mean &#x91;shall have prospective effect upon enactment,&#x92; and that presumption is too strong to be overcome by any negative inference [drawn from other provisions of the statute].&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 288 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, concurring in judgments).  The Court&#x92;s &#x93;nonapplication of &#x2026; the presumption against retroactivity&#x94; to &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is thus just another way of stating that the statute takes immediate effect in pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Though the Court resists the <em>Bruner</em> rule, it cannot cite a<em> single case</em> in the history of Anglo-American law (before today) in which a jurisdiction-stripping provision was denied immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation.  By contrast, the cases granting such immediate effect are legion, and they repeatedly rely on the plain language of the jurisdictional repeal as an &#x93;inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19, by requiring an express reservation to save pending cases.

        <p class="bodytext">    Disregarding the plain meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the requirement of explicit exception set forth in the foregoing cases, the Court instead favors &#x93;a negative inference &#x2026; from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 13.  Specifically, it appeals to the fact that &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) are explicitly made applicable to pending cases (by &#xA7;1005(h)(2)).  A negative inference of the sort the Court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an ambiguous provision, but since the meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear, the omitted language in that context would have been redundant.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if &#xA7;1005(e)(1) were at all ambiguous in its application to pending cases, the &#x93;negative inference&#x94; from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) touted by the Court would have no force.  The numerous cases in the <em>Bruner</em> line would at least create a powerful default &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11.  The negative inference urged by the Court would be a particularly awkward and indirect way of rebutting such a longstanding and consistent practice.  This is especially true since the negative inference that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(h)(2)&#x92;s specification that certain provisions <em>shall</em> apply to pending cases is matched by a negative inference in the opposite direction that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(b)(2), which provides that certain provisions shall <em>not </em>apply to pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court&#x92;s reliance on our opinion in <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, is utterly misplaced.  <em>Lindh</em> involved two provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA): a set of amendments to chapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined the scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts; and a provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas statute specially to govern federal collateral review of state capital cases.  See 521 U. S., at 326&#x96;327.  The latter provision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applicable to cases pending at the time of AEDPA&#x92;s enactment; the former made no specific reference to pending cases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 327.  In <em>Lindh</em>, we drew a negative inference from chapter 154&#x92;s explicit reference to pending cases, to conclude that the chapter 153 amendments did <em>not</em> apply in pending cases.  It was essential to our reasoning, however, that both provisions appeared to be <em>identically difficult</em> to classify under our retroactivity cases.  First, we noted that, after <em>Landgraf</em>, there was reason for Congress to suppose that an explicit statement was required to render the amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending cases, because the new chapter 154 &#x93;will have substantive as well as purely procedural effects.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 327.  The next step&#x97;and the critical step&#x97;in our reasoning was that Congress had <em>identical</em> reason to suppose that an explicit statement would be required to apply the chapter 153 amendments to pending cases, but did not provide it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  The negative inference of <em>Lindh</em> rested on the fact that &#x93;[n]othing &#x2026; but a different intent explain[ed] the different treatment.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Here, by contrast, there is ample reason for the different treatment.  The exclusive-review provisions of the DTA, unlike both &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the AEDPA amendments in <em>Lindh</em>, confer <em>new</em> jurisdiction (in the D. C. Circuit)  where there was none before.  For better or for worse, our recent cases have contrasted jurisdiction-<em>creating</em> provisions with jurisdiction-<em>ousting</em> provisions, retaining the venerable rule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied in pending cases, but strongly indicating that the former are typically retroactive.  For example, we stated in <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)
, that a statute &#x93;that <em>creates</em> jurisdiction where none previously existed&#x94; is &#x93;as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other.&#x94;  See also <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>,

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J</span>.); <em>id.</em>, at 722 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy</span>, J., dissenting).  The Court gives our retroactivity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that &#x93;subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents.&#x94;<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            <em>Ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18.  This statement rises to the level of sarcasm when one considers its author&#x92;s description of the governing test of our retroactivity jurisprudence:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The conclusion that a particular rule operates &#x91;retroactively&#x92; comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.  Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.  However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have &#x91;sound &#x2026; instinct[s],&#x92; &#x2026; and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 270 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The only &#x93;familiar consideration,&#x94; &#x93;reasonable reliance,&#x94; and &#x93;settled expectation&#x94; I am aware of pertaining to the present case is the rule of <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;applicable to &#xA7;1005(e)(1), but not to &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)&#x97;which the Court stubbornly disregards.  It is utterly beyond question that &#xA7;1005(e)(2)&#x92;s and (3)&#x92;s application to pending cases (without explicit specification) was not as clear as &#xA7;1005(e)(1)&#x92;s.  That is alone enough to explain the difference in treatment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Another obvious reason for the specification was to stave off any Suspension Clause problems raised by the immediately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by subsection (e)(1).  That is to say, specification of the immediate effectiveness of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) (which, unlike subsection (e)(1), would not fall within the <em>Bruner </em>rule and would not <em>automatically</em> be deemed applicable in pending cases) could reasonably have been thought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas jurisdiction that subsection (e)(1) eliminated in pending cases with an adequate substitute.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These considerations by no means prove that an explicit statement would be <em>required</em> to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable in pending cases.  But they surely gave Congress ample reason to <em>doubt</em> that their application in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the Court glibly assumes.  In any event, even if it were true that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x93; &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18, this would merely establish that subsection (h)(2)&#x92;s reference to pending cases was wholly superfluous when applied to subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3), just as it would have been for subsection (e)(1).  <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference makes sense only when Congress would have perceived &#x93;the wisdom of being explicit&#x94; with respect to the immediate application of <em>both</em> of two statutory provisions, 521 U. S., at 328, but chose to be explicit only for one of them&#x97;not when it would have perceived <em>no need </em>to be explicit for both, but enacted a redundancy only for one.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, it is simply untrue that Congress &#x93; &#x91;should have been just as concerned about&#x92; &#x94; specifying the application of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) to pending cases, <em>ante</em>, at 14 (quoting <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329).  In fact, the negative-inference approach of <em>Lindh</em> is particularly inappropriate in this case, because the negative inference from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) would tend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that <em>are</em> explicitly rendered applicable in pending cases, &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3).  Those provisions purport to vest &#x93;exclusive&#x94; jurisdiction in the D. C. Circuit to consider the claims raised by petitioners here.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.  By drawing a negative inference <em>&lt;fs fs="11.5"&gt;&amp;Agrave;</em>
            <em>la</em>
            <em>Lindh</em>, the Court supplants this exclusive-review mechanism with a dual-review mechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to file applications challenging the CSRTs or military commissions before December 30, 2005.  Whatever the force of <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference in other cases, it surely should not apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision from which the negative inference is drawn.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Worst of all is the Court&#x92;s reliance on the legislative history of the DTA to buttress its implausible reading of &#xA7;1005(e)(1).  We have repeatedly held that such reliance is impermissible where, as here, the statutory language is unambiguous.  But the Court nevertheless relies both on floor statements from the Senate and (quite heavily) on the drafting history of the DTA.  To begin with floor statements: The Court urges that some &#x93;statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to&#x94; the Court&#x92;s interpretation, citing excerpts from the floor debate that support its view, <em>ante</em>, 15&#x96;16, n. 10.  The Court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor statements by the DTA&#x92;s sponsors that flatly contradict its view, because &#x93;those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record <em>after</em> the Senate debate.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Of course this observation, even if true, makes no difference unless one indulges the fantasy that Senate floor speeches are attended (like the Philippics of Demosthenes) by throngs of eager listeners, instead of being delivered (like Demosthenes&#x92; practice sessions on the beach) alone into a vast emptiness.  Whether the floor statements are spoken where no Senator hears, or written where no Senator reads, they represent at most the views of a single Senator.  In any event, the Court greatly exaggerates the one-sidedness of the portions of the floor debate that clearly occurred before the DTA&#x92;s enactment.  Some of the statements of Senator Graham, a sponsor of the bill, only make sense on the assumption that pending cases are covered.<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    But selectivity is not the greatest vice in the Court&#x92;s use of floor statements to resolve today&#x92;s case.

The question was divisive, and floor statements made on both sides were undoubtedly opportunistic and crafted <em>solely</em> for use in the briefs in this very litigation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 151 Cong. Rec. S14257&#x96;S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen. Levin) (arguing against a reading that would &#x93;stri[p] the Federal courts of jurisdiction to consider pending cases, <em>including the Hamdan case now pending in the Supreme Court</em>,&#x94; and urging that <em>Lindh</em> requires the same negative inference that the Court indulges today (emphasis added)).  The Court&#x92;s reliance on such statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar opportunism.  In a virtually identical context, the author of today&#x92;s opinion has written for the Court that &#x93;[t]he legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 262 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).  Likewise, the handful of floor statements that the Court treats as authoritative do not &#x93;reflec[t] any general agreement.&#x94;  They reflect the now-common tactic&#x97;which the Court once again rewards&#x97;of pursuing through floor-speech <em>ipse dixit</em> what could not be achieved through the constitutionally prescribed method of putting language into a bill that a majority of both Houses vote for and the President signs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the floor statements, at least the Court shows some semblance of seemly shame, tucking away its reference to them in a half-hearted footnote.  Not so for its reliance on the DTA&#x92;s drafting history, which is displayed prominently, see <em>ante</em>, at 14&#x96;15.  I have explained elsewhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or reliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute than any other form of legislative history.  This case presents a textbook example of its unreliability.  The Court, <em>ante</em>, at 14, trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the Senate included redundant language, not included in the DTA as passed, reconfirming that the abolition of habeas jurisdiction &#x93;shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.&#x94;  151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005).  But this earlier version of the bill also differed from the DTA in other material respects.  Most notably, it provided for postdecision review by the D. C. Circuit only of the decisions of <em>CSRTs</em>, not military commissions, <em>ibid.; </em>and it limited that review to whether &#x93;the status determination &#x2026; was consistent with the procedures and standards specified by the Secretary of Defense,&#x94; <em>ibid.,</em> not whether &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures &#x2026; is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742.  To say that what moved Senators to reject this earlier bill was the &#x93;action that is pending&#x94; provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even this Court&#x92;s greatest Justices.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  And to think that the House and the President also had this rejection firmly in mind is absurd.  As always&#x97;but <em>especially</em> in the context of strident, partisan legislative conflict of the sort that characterized enactment of this legislation&#x97;the language of the statute that was actually passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President is our only authoritative and only reliable guidepost.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A final but powerful indication of the fact that the Court has made a mess of this statute is the nature of the consequences that ensue.  Though this case concerns a habeas application challenging a trial by military commission, DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(1) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider <em>any</em> &#x93;application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  The vast majority of pending petitions, no doubt, do not relate to military commissions at all, but to more commonly challenged aspects of &#x93;detention&#x94; such as the terms and conditions of confinement.  See <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/466" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 466</a>,

 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  The Solicitor General represents that &#x93;[h]abeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a purported 600 [Guantanamo Bay] detainees,&#x94; including one that &#x93;seek[s] relief on behalf of every Guantanamo detainee who has not already filed an action,&#x94; Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 20, n. 10 (hereinafter Motion to Dismiss).  The Court&#x92;s interpretation transforms a provision abolishing jurisdiction over <em>all</em> Guantanamo-related habeas petitions into a provision that retains jurisdiction over cases sufficiently numerous to keep the courts busy for years to come.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Because I would hold that &#xA7;1005(e)(1) unambiguously terminates the jurisdiction of all courts to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; pending habeas applications, I must confront petitioner&#x92;s arguments that the provision, so interpreted, violates the Suspension Clause.  This claim is easily dispatched.  We stated in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;We are cited to no instance where a court, in this or any other country where the writ is known, has issued it on behalf of an alien enemy who, at no relevant time and in no stage of his captivity, has been within its territorial jurisdiction.  Nothing in the text of the Constitution extends such a right, nor does anything in our statutes.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Notwithstanding the ill-considered dicta in the Court&#x92;s opinion in <em>Rasul</em>, 542 U.

See <em>id.</em>, at 500&#x96;505 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  Petitioner, an enemy alien detained abroad, has no rights under the Suspension Clause.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But even if petitioner were fully protected by the Clause, the DTA would create no suspension problem.  This Court has repeatedly acknowledged that &#x93;the substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person&#x92;s detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.&#x94;  <em>Swain</em> v. <em>Pressley</em>,

 (&#x93;Congress could, without raising any constitutional questions, provide an adequate substitute through the courts of appeals&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner has made no showing that the postdecision exclusive review by the D. C. Circuit provided in &#xA7;1005(e)(3) is inadequate to test the legality of his trial by military commission.  His principal argument is that the exclusive-review provisions are inadequate because they foreclose review of the claims he raises here.  Though petitioner&#x92;s brief does not parse the statutory language, his argument evidently rests on an erroneously narrow reading of DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  That provision grants the D. C. Circuit authority to review, &#x93;to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.&#x94;  In the quoted text, the phrase &#x93;such standards and procedures&#x94; refers to &#x93;the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (A),&#x94; namely &#x93;Military Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).&#x94;  DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(i), (e)(3)(A), <em>ibid</em>.  This Military Commission Order (Order No. 1) is the Department of Defense&#x92;s fundamental implementing order for the President&#x92;s order authorizing trials by military commission.  Order No. 1 establishes commissions, &#xA7;2; delineates their jurisdiction, &#xA7;3; provides for their officers, &#xA7;4(A); provides for their prosecution and defense counsel, &#xA7;4(B), (C); lays out all their procedures, both pretrial and trial, &#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P), &#xA7;6(A)&#x96;(G); and provides for posttrial military review through the Secretary of Defense and the President, &#xA7;6(H).  In short, the &#x93;standards and procedures specified in&#x94; Order No. 1 include <em>every aspect</em> of the military commissions, including the fact of their existence and every respect in which they differ from courts-martial.  Petitioner&#x92;s claims that the President lacks legal authority to try him before a military commission constitute claims that &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures,&#x94; as specified in Order No. 1, is &#x93;[in]consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  The D. C. Circuit thus retains jurisdiction to consider these claims on postdecision review, and the Government does not dispute that the DTA leaves unaffected our certiorari jurisdiction under

Thus, the DTA merely <em>defers</em> our jurisdiction to consider petitioner&#x92;s claims; it does not eliminate that jurisdiction.  It constitutes neither an &#x93;inadequate&#x94; nor an &#x93;ineffective&#x94; substitute for petitioner&#x92;s pending habeas application.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Though it does not squarely address the issue, the Court hints ominously that &#x93;the Government&#x92;s preferred reading&#x94; would &#x93;rais[e] grave questions about Congress&#x92; authority to impinge upon this Court&#x92;s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 10&#x96;11 (citing <em>Ex parte Yerger</em>, 
8Wall.
85 (1869); <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin</em>,

It is not clear how there could be any such lurking questions, in light of the aptly named &#x93;<em>Exceptions</em> Clause&#x94; of Article III, &#xA7;2, which, in making our appellate jurisdiction subject to &#x93;such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make,&#x94; explicitly permits exactly what Congress has done here.  But any doubt our prior cases might have created on this score is surely chimerical in <em>this</em> case.  As just noted, the exclusive-review provisions provide a substitute for habeas review adequate to satisfy the Suspension Clause, which <em>forbids</em> the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.  <em>A fortiori</em> they provide a substitute adequate to satisfy any implied substantive limitations, whether real or imaginary, upon the Exceptions Clause, which <em>authorizes</em> such exceptions as &#xA7;1005(e)(1).</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if Congress had not clearly and constitutionally eliminated jurisdiction over this case, neither this Court nor the lower courts ought to exercise it.  Traditionally, equitable principles govern both the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and the granting of the injunctive relief sought by petitioner.  See <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">311</a> (1982)
.  In light of Congress&#x92;s provision of an alternate avenue for petitioner&#x92;s claims in &#xA7;1005(e)(3), those equitable principles counsel that we abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In requesting abstention, the Government relies principally on <em>Councilman</em>, in which we abstained from considering a serviceman&#x92;s claim that his charge for marijuana possession was not sufficiently &#x93;service-connected&#x94; to trigger the subject-matter jurisdiction of the military courts-martial.  See 420 U. S., at 740, 758.  Admittedly, <em>Councilman</em> does not squarely control petitioner&#x92;s case, but it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence.  As the Court describes, <em>ante</em>, at 21, <em>Councilman</em> &#x93;identifie[d] two considerations of comity that together favor[ed] abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings against service personnel.&#x94;  But the Court errs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this case.  Both of them, and a third consideration not emphasized in <em>Councilman</em>, all cut in favor of abstention here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, the Court observes that <em>Councilman</em> rested in part on the fact that &#x93;military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts,&#x94; and concludes that &#x93;Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  This is true enough.  But for some reason, the Court fails to make any inquiry into whether military commission trials might involve <em>other</em> &#x93;military necessities&#x94; or &#x93;unique military exigencies,&#x94; 420 U. S., at 757, comparable in gravity to those at stake in <em>Councilman</em>.  To put this in context: The charge against the respondent in <em>Councilman</em> was the off-base possession and sale of marijuana while he was stationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, see <em>id.,</em> at 739&#x96;740.  The charge against the petitioner here is joining and actively abetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thousands of innocent American civilians without warning on September 11, 2001.  While <em>Councilman</em> held that the prosecution of the former charge involved &#x93;military necessities&#x94; counseling against our interference, the Court <em>does not even ponder the same question</em> for the latter charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The reason for the Court&#x92;s &#x93;blinkered study&#x94; of this question, <em>ante</em>, at 19, is not hard to fathom.  The principal opinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe that the trials by military commission involve any &#x93;military necessity&#x94; <em>at all:</em> &#x93;The charge&#x92;s shortcomings &#x2026; are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition &#x2026; for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 48.  This is quite at odds with the views on this subject expressed by our political branches.  Because of &#x93;military necessity,&#x94; a joint session of Congress authorized the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force,&#x94; including military commissions, &#x93;against those nations, organizations, or persons [such as petitioner] he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force, &#xA7;2(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224, note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1541.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. &#xA7;1541</a> (2000 ed., Supp. III).  In keeping with this authority, the President has determined that &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order &#x2026; to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 2001, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e) (2002).  It is not clear where the Court derives the authority&#x97;or the audacity&#x97;to contradict this determination.  If &#x93;military necessities&#x94; relating to &#x93;duty&#x94; and &#x93;discipline&#x94; required abstention in <em>Councilman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 757, military necessities relating to the disabling, deterrence, and punishment of the mass-murdering terrorists of September 11 require abstention all the more here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court further seeks to distinguish <em>Councilman</em> on the ground that &#x93;the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  To be sure, <em>Councilman</em> emphasized that &#x93;Congress created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion, who would gain over time thorough familiarity with military problems.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 758 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).  The Court contrasts this &#x93;integrated system&#x94; insulated from military influence with the review scheme established by Order No. 1, which &#x93;provides that appeal of a review panel&#x92;s decision may be had only to the Secretary of Defense himself, &#xA7;6(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, &#xA7;6(H)(6).&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if we were to accept the Court&#x92;s extraordinary assumption that the President &#x93;lack[s] the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 23,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

            </a> the Court&#x92;s description of the review scheme here is anachronistic.  As of December 30, 2005, the &#x93;fina[l]&#x94; review of decisions by military commissions is now conducted by the D. C. Circuit pursuant to &#xA7;1005(e)(3) of the DTA, and by this Court under

                    <b>9</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  At the time we decided <em>Councilman</em>, Congress had not &#x93;conferred on any Art[icle] III court jurisdiction directly to review court-martial determinations.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 746.  The final arbiter of direct appeals was the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), an Article I court whose members possessed neither life tenure, nor salary protection, nor the constitutional protection from removal provided to federal judges in Article III, &#xA7;1.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/867.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;867(a)(2)</a> (1970 ed.).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Moreover, a third consideration counsels strongly in favor of abstention in this case.  <em>Councilman</em> reasoned that the &#x93;considerations of comity, the necessity of respect for coordinate judicial systems&#x94; that motivated our decision in <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
, were inapplicable to courts-martial, because &#x93;the particular demands of federalism are not implicated.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 756, 757.  Though military commissions likewise do not implicate &#x93;the particular demands of federalism,&#x94; considerations of <em>interbranch</em> comity at the federal level weigh heavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case.  Here, apparently for the first time in history, see Motion to Dismiss 6, a District Court enjoined ongoing military commission proceedings, which had been deemed &#x93;necessary&#x94; by the President &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e).  Such an order brings the Judicial Branch into direct conflict with the Executive in an area where the Executive&#x92;s competence is maximal and ours is virtually nonexistent.  We should exercise our equitable discretion to <em>avoid</em> such conflict.  Instead, the Court rushes headlong to meet it.  Elsewhere, we have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state courts have &#x93;the first opportunity to review&#x94; a petitioner&#x92;s claim, merely to &#x93;reduc[e] friction between the state and federal court systems.&#x94;  <em>O&#x92;Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/526/838" class="subref" title="subref">526 U. S. 838</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">845</a> (1999)
.  The &#x93;friction&#x94; created today between this Court and the Executive Branch is many times more serious.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the face of such concerns, the Court relies heavily on <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/1" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 1</a> (1942)
: &#x93;Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, [in <em>Quirin</em>] we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  It is likely that the Government in <em>Quirin</em>, unlike here, preferred a hasty resolution of the case in this Court, so that it could swiftly execute the sentences imposed, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/507" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 507</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">569</a> (2004)
 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J</span>., dissenting).  But the Court&#x92;s reliance on <em>Quirin</em> suffers from a more fundamental defect: Once again, it ignores the DTA, which creates an avenue for the consideration of petitioner&#x92;s claims that did not exist at the time of <em>Quirin</em>.  Collateral application for habeas review was the <em>only</em> vehicle available.  And there was no compelling reason to postpone consideration of the <em>Quirin</em> application until the termination of military proceedings, because the only cognizable claims presented were general challenges to the authority of the commissions that would not be affected by the specific proceedings.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8&#x96;9, n. 2.  In the DTA, by contrast, Congress has expanded the scope of Article III review and has channeled it exclusively through a single, postverdict appeal to Article III courts.  Because Congress has created a novel unitary scheme of Article III review of military commissions that was absent in 1942, <em>Quirin</em> is no longer governing precedent.</p>

, to the effect that &#x93;a statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.&#x94;  Ante, at 14, n. 9 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).  But this quote merely restates the obvious: An effective-date provision does not render a statute applicable to &#x93;conduct that occurred at an earlier date,&#x94; but of course it renders the statute applicable to conduct that occurs on the effective date and all future dates&#x97;such as the Court&#x92;s exercise of jurisdiction here.  The Court seems to suggest that, because the effective-date provision does not authorize retroactive application, it also fails to authorize prospective application (and is thus useless verbiage).  This cannot be true.

2743.  The relevance of this observation to the abstention question is unfathomable.  The fact that Article III review is discretionary does not mean that it lacks &#x93;structural insulation from military influence,&#x94; ante, at 23, and its discretionary nature presents no obstacle to the courts&#x92; future review these cases.


The Court might more cogently have relied on the discretionary nature of review to argue that the statute provides an inadequate substitute for habeas review under the Suspension Clause.  See supra, at 16&#x96;18.  But this argument would have no force, even if all appeals to the D. C. Circuit were discretionary.  The exercise of habeas jurisdiction has traditionally been entirely a matter of the court&#x92;s equitable discretion, see Withrow v. Williams,

        <p class="bodytext">    On December 30, 2005, Congress enacted the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA).  It unambiguously provides that, as of that date, &#x93;no court, justice, or judge&#x94; shall have jurisdiction to consider the habeas application of a Guantanamo Bay detainee.  Notwithstanding this plain directive, the Court today concludes that, on what it calls the statute&#x92;s <em>most natural</em> reading, <em>every</em> &#x93;court, justice, or judge&#x94; before whom such a habeas application was pending on December 30 has jurisdiction to hear, consider, and render judgment on it.  This conclusion is patently erroneous.  And even if it were not, the jurisdiction supposedly retained should, in an exercise of sound equitable discretion, not be exercised.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The DTA provides: &#x93;[N]o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742 (internal division omitted).  This provision &#x93;t[ook] effect on the date of the enactment of this Act,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(h)(1), <em>id.</em>, at 2743, which was December 30, 2005.  As of that date, then, <em>no</em> court had jurisdiction to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; the merits of petitioner&#x92;s habeas application.  This repeal of jurisdiction is simply not ambiguous as between pending and future cases.  It prohibits <em>any</em> exercise of jurisdiction, and it became effective as to <em>all</em> cases last December 30.  It is also perfectly clear that the phrase &#x93;no court, <em>justice</em>, or judge&#x94; includes this Court and its Members, and that by exercising our appellate jurisdiction in this case we are &#x93;hear[ing] or consider[ing] &#x2026; an application for a writ of habeas<span class="softbreak"/>corpus.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that statutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases pending at their effective date.  For example, in <em>Bruner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/343/112" class="subref" title="subref">343 U. S. 112</a> (1952)
, we granted certiorari to consider whether the Tucker Act&#x92;s provision denying district court jurisdiction over suits by &#x93;officers&#x94; of the United States barred a suit by an <em>employee</em> of the United States.  After we granted certiorari, Congress amended the Tucker Act by adding suits by &#x93; &#x91;employees&#x92; &#x94; to the provision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 114.  This statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district courts &#x93;became effective&#x94; while the case was pending before us, <em>ibid.</em>, and made no explicit reference to pending cases.  Because the statute &#x93;did not reserve jurisdiction over pending cases,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 115, we held that it clearly ousted jurisdiction over them.  Summarizing centuries of practice, we said: &#x93;This rule&#x97;that, when a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to pending cases, all cases fall with the law&#x97;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 116&#x96;117.  See also <em>Landgraf</em> v. <em>USI Film Products</em>,

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>) (&#x93;We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction terminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not, as today&#x92;s opinion for the Court would have it, a judge-made &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11, that we have invented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes.  It is simple recognition of the reality that the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.  <em>And this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To alter this plain meaning, our cases have required an explicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdiction-repealing statute.  For example, <em>Bruner</em>, as mentioned, looked to whether Congress made &#x93;any reservation as to pending cases.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117; see also <em>id.</em>, at 115 (&#x93;Congress made no provision for cases pending at the effective date of the Act withdrawing jurisdiction and, for this reason, Courts of Appeals ordered pending cases terminated for want of jurisdiction&#x94;).  Likewise, in <em>Hallowell</em> v. <em>Commons</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/239/506" class="subref" title="subref">239 U. S. 506</a> (1916)
, Justice Holmes relied on the fact that the jurisdiction-ousting provision &#x93;made no exception for pending litigation, but purported to be universal,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 508.  And in <em>Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Ritchie</em>, 
5Wall.
541 (1867), we again relied on the fact that the jurisdictional repeal was made &#x93;without any saving of such causes as that before us,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 544.  As in <em>Bruner</em>, <em>Hallowell</em>, and <em>Ritchie</em>, the DTA&#x92;s directive that &#x93;no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742, is made &#x93;without any reservation as to pending cases&#x94; and &#x93;purport[s] to be universal.&#x94;  What we stated in an earlier case remains true here: &#x93;[W]hen, if it had been the intention to confine the operation of [the jurisdictional repeal] &#x2026; to cases not pending, it would have been so easy to have said so, we must presume that Congress meant the language employed should have its usual and ordinary signification, and that the old law should be unconditionally repealed.&#x94;  <em>Railroad Co.</em> v. <em>Grant</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    The Court claims that I &#x93;rea[d] too much into&#x94; the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases, <em>ante</em>, at 12, n. 7, and that &#x93;the <em>Bruner</em> rule&#x94; has never been &#x93;an inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19.  But the Court sorely misdescribes <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;as if it were a kind of early-day <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, resolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative inference.  On the contrary, as described above, <em>Bruner</em> stated its holding as an unqualified &#x93;rule,&#x94; which &#x93;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117.  Though <em>Bruner</em> referred to an express savings clause elsewhere in the statute, <em>id.,</em> at 115, n. 7, it disavowed any reliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain meaning, quoting <em>Ritchie</em> at length: &#x93; &#x91;It is quite possible that this effect of the [jurisdiction-stripping statute] was not contemplated by Congress&#x2026; .  [B]ut when terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention.&#x92; &#x94;  343 U. S., at 116 (quoting 5 Wall., at 544&#x96;545).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court also attempts to evade the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases by asserting that &#x93;the &#x91;presumption&#x92; [of application to pending cases] that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption&#x97;viz., the presumption against retroactivity&#x97;in certain limited circumstances.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  I have already explained that what the Court calls a &#x93;presumption&#x94; is simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous meaning of such provisions.  But even taking it to be what the Court says, the effect upon the present case would be the same.  <em>Prospective</em> applications of a statute are &#x93;effective&#x94; upon the statute&#x92;s effective date; that is what an effective-date provision like &#xA7;1005(h)(1) <em>means</em>.<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

            </a>  &#x93; &#x91;[S]hall take effect upon enactment&#x92; is presumed to mean &#x91;shall have prospective effect upon enactment,&#x92; and that presumption is too strong to be overcome by any negative inference [drawn from other provisions of the statute].&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 288 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, concurring in judgments).  The Court&#x92;s &#x93;nonapplication of &#x2026; the presumption against retroactivity&#x94; to &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is thus just another way of stating that the statute takes immediate effect in pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Though the Court resists the <em>Bruner</em> rule, it cannot cite a<em> single case</em> in the history of Anglo-American law (before today) in which a jurisdiction-stripping provision was denied immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation.  By contrast, the cases granting such immediate effect are legion, and they repeatedly rely on the plain language of the jurisdictional repeal as an &#x93;inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19, by requiring an express reservation to save pending cases.

Specifically, it appeals to the fact that &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) are explicitly made applicable to pending cases (by &#xA7;1005(h)(2)).  A negative inference of the sort the Court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an ambiguous provision, but since the meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear, the omitted language in that context would have been redundant.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if &#xA7;1005(e)(1) were at all ambiguous in its application to pending cases, the &#x93;negative inference&#x94; from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) touted by the Court would have no force.  The numerous cases in the <em>Bruner</em> line would at least create a powerful default &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11.  The negative inference urged by the Court would be a particularly awkward and indirect way of rebutting such a longstanding and consistent practice.  This is especially true since the negative inference that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(h)(2)&#x92;s specification that certain provisions <em>shall</em> apply to pending cases is matched by a negative inference in the opposite direction that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(b)(2), which provides that certain provisions shall <em>not </em>apply to pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court&#x92;s reliance on our opinion in <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, is utterly misplaced.  <em>Lindh</em> involved two provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA): a set of amendments to chapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined the scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts; and a provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas statute specially to govern federal collateral review of state capital cases.  See 521 U. S., at 326&#x96;327.  The latter provision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applicable to cases pending at the time of AEDPA&#x92;s enactment; the former made no specific reference to pending cases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 327.  In <em>Lindh</em>, we drew a negative inference from chapter 154&#x92;s explicit reference to pending cases, to conclude that the chapter 153 amendments did <em>not</em> apply in pending cases.  It was essential to our reasoning, however, that both provisions appeared to be <em>identically difficult</em> to classify under our retroactivity cases.  First, we noted that, after <em>Landgraf</em>, there was reason for Congress to suppose that an explicit statement was required to render the amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending cases, because the new chapter 154 &#x93;will have substantive as well as purely procedural effects.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 327.  The next step&#x97;and the critical step&#x97;in our reasoning was that Congress had <em>identical</em> reason to suppose that an explicit statement would be required to apply the chapter 153 amendments to pending cases, but did not provide it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  The negative inference of <em>Lindh</em> rested on the fact that &#x93;[n]othing &#x2026; but a different intent explain[ed] the different treatment.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Here, by contrast, there is ample reason for the different treatment.  The exclusive-review provisions of the DTA, unlike both &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the AEDPA amendments in <em>Lindh</em>, confer <em>new</em> jurisdiction (in the D. C. Circuit)  where there was none before.  For better or for worse, our recent cases have contrasted jurisdiction-<em>creating</em> provisions with jurisdiction-<em>ousting</em> provisions, retaining the venerable rule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied in pending cases, but strongly indicating that the former are typically retroactive.  For example, we stated in <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)
, that a statute &#x93;that <em>creates</em> jurisdiction where none previously existed&#x94; is &#x93;as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other.&#x94;  See also <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>,

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J</span>.); <em>id.</em>, at 722 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy</span>, J., dissenting).  The Court gives our retroactivity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that &#x93;subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents.&#x94;<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            <em>Ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18.  This statement rises to the level of sarcasm when one considers its author&#x92;s description of the governing test of our retroactivity jurisprudence:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The conclusion that a particular rule operates &#x91;retroactively&#x92; comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.  Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.  However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have &#x91;sound &#x2026; instinct[s],&#x92; &#x2026; and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 270 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The only &#x93;familiar consideration,&#x94; &#x93;reasonable reliance,&#x94; and &#x93;settled expectation&#x94; I am aware of pertaining to the present case is the rule of <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;applicable to &#xA7;1005(e)(1), but not to &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)&#x97;which the Court stubbornly disregards.  It is utterly beyond question that &#xA7;1005(e)(2)&#x92;s and (3)&#x92;s application to pending cases (without explicit specification) was not as clear as &#xA7;1005(e)(1)&#x92;s.  That is alone enough to explain the difference in treatment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Another obvious reason for the specification was to stave off any Suspension Clause problems raised by the immediately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by subsection (e)(1).  That is to say, specification of the immediate effectiveness of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) (which, unlike subsection (e)(1), would not fall within the <em>Bruner </em>rule and would not <em>automatically</em> be deemed applicable in pending cases) could reasonably have been thought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas jurisdiction that subsection (e)(1) eliminated in pending cases with an adequate substitute.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These considerations by no means prove that an explicit statement would be <em>required</em> to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable in pending cases.  But they surely gave Congress ample reason to <em>doubt</em> that their application in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the Court glibly assumes.  In any event, even if it were true that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x93; &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18, this would merely establish that subsection (h)(2)&#x92;s reference to pending cases was wholly superfluous when applied to subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3), just as it would have been for subsection (e)(1).  <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference makes sense only when Congress would have perceived &#x93;the wisdom of being explicit&#x94; with respect to the immediate application of <em>both</em> of two statutory provisions, 521 U. S., at 328, but chose to be explicit only for one of them&#x97;not when it would have perceived <em>no need </em>to be explicit for both, but enacted a redundancy only for one.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, it is simply untrue that Congress &#x93; &#x91;should have been just as concerned about&#x92; &#x94; specifying the application of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) to pending cases, <em>ante</em>, at 14 (quoting <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329).  In fact, the negative-inference approach of <em>Lindh</em> is particularly inappropriate in this case, because the negative inference from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) would tend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that <em>are</em> explicitly rendered applicable in pending cases, &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3).  Those provisions purport to vest &#x93;exclusive&#x94; jurisdiction in the D. C. Circuit to consider the claims raised by petitioners here.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.  By drawing a negative inference <em>&lt;fs fs="11.5"&gt;&amp;Agrave;</em>
            <em>la</em>
            <em>Lindh</em>, the Court supplants this exclusive-review mechanism with a dual-review mechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to file applications challenging the CSRTs or military commissions before December 30, 2005.  Whatever the force of <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference in other cases, it surely should not apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision from which the negative inference is drawn.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Worst of all is the Court&#x92;s reliance on the legislative history of the DTA to buttress its implausible reading of &#xA7;1005(e)(1).  We have repeatedly held that such reliance is impermissible where, as here, the statutory language is unambiguous.  But the Court nevertheless relies both on floor statements from the Senate and (quite heavily) on the drafting history of the DTA.  To begin with floor statements: The Court urges that some &#x93;statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to&#x94; the Court&#x92;s interpretation, citing excerpts from the floor debate that support its view, <em>ante</em>, 15&#x96;16, n. 10.  The Court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor statements by the DTA&#x92;s sponsors that flatly contradict its view, because &#x93;those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record <em>after</em> the Senate debate.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Of course this observation, even if true, makes no difference unless one indulges the fantasy that Senate floor speeches are attended (like the Philippics of Demosthenes) by throngs of eager listeners, instead of being delivered (like Demosthenes&#x92; practice sessions on the beach) alone into a vast emptiness.  Whether the floor statements are spoken where no Senator hears, or written where no Senator reads, they represent at most the views of a single Senator.  In any event, the Court greatly exaggerates the one-sidedness of the portions of the floor debate that clearly occurred before the DTA&#x92;s enactment.  Some of the statements of Senator Graham, a sponsor of the bill, only make sense on the assumption that pending cases are covered.<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    But selectivity is not the greatest vice in the Court&#x92;s use of floor statements to resolve today&#x92;s case.  These statements were made when Members of Congress were fully aware that our continuing jurisdiction <em>over this very case</em> was at issue.  The question was divisive, and floor statements made on both sides were undoubtedly opportunistic and crafted <em>solely</em> for use in the briefs in this very litigation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 151 Cong. Rec. S14257&#x96;S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen. Levin) (arguing against a reading that would &#x93;stri[p] the Federal courts of jurisdiction to consider pending cases, <em>including the Hamdan case now pending in the Supreme Court</em>,&#x94; and urging that <em>Lindh</em> requires the same negative inference that the Court indulges today (emphasis added)).  The Court&#x92;s reliance on such statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar opportunism.  In a virtually identical context, the author of today&#x92;s opinion has written for the Court that &#x93;[t]he legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 262 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).  Likewise, the handful of floor statements that the Court treats as authoritative do not &#x93;reflec[t] any general agreement.&#x94;  They reflect the now-common tactic&#x97;which the Court once again rewards&#x97;of pursuing through floor-speech <em>ipse dixit</em> what could not be achieved through the constitutionally prescribed method of putting language into a bill that a majority of both Houses vote for and the President signs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the floor statements, at least the Court shows some semblance of seemly shame, tucking away its reference to them in a half-hearted footnote.  Not so for its reliance on the DTA&#x92;s drafting history, which is displayed prominently, see <em>ante</em>, at 14&#x96;15.  I have explained elsewhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or reliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute than any other form of legislative history.  This case presents a textbook example of its unreliability.  The Court, <em>ante</em>, at 14, trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the Senate included redundant language, not included in the DTA as passed, reconfirming that the abolition of habeas jurisdiction &#x93;shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.&#x94;  151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005).  But this earlier version of the bill also differed from the DTA in other material respects.  Most notably, it provided for postdecision review by the D. C. Circuit only of the decisions of <em>CSRTs</em>, not military commissions, <em>ibid.; </em>and it limited that review to whether &#x93;the status determination &#x2026; was consistent with the procedures and standards specified by the Secretary of Defense,&#x94; <em>ibid.,</em> not whether &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures &#x2026; is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742.  To say that what moved Senators to reject this earlier bill was the &#x93;action that is pending&#x94; provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even this Court&#x92;s greatest Justices.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  And to think that the House and the President also had this rejection firmly in mind is absurd.  As always&#x97;but <em>especially</em> in the context of strident, partisan legislative conflict of the sort that characterized enactment of this legislation&#x97;the language of the statute that was actually passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President is our only authoritative and only reliable guidepost.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A final but powerful indication of the fact that the Court has made a mess of this statute is the nature of the consequences that ensue.  Though this case concerns a habeas application challenging a trial by military commission, DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(1) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider <em>any</em> &#x93;application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  The vast majority of pending petitions, no doubt, do not relate to military commissions at all, but to more commonly challenged aspects of &#x93;detention&#x94; such as the terms and conditions of confinement.  See <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/466" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 466</a>,

 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  The Solicitor General represents that &#x93;[h]abeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a purported 600 [Guantanamo Bay] detainees,&#x94; including one that &#x93;seek[s] relief on behalf of every Guantanamo detainee who has not already filed an action,&#x94; Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 20, n. 10 (hereinafter Motion to Dismiss).  The Court&#x92;s interpretation transforms a provision abolishing jurisdiction over <em>all</em> Guantanamo-related habeas petitions into a provision that retains jurisdiction over cases sufficiently numerous to keep the courts busy for years to come.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Because I would hold that &#xA7;1005(e)(1) unambiguously terminates the jurisdiction of all courts to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; pending habeas applications, I must confront petitioner&#x92;s arguments that the provision, so interpreted, violates the Suspension Clause.  This claim is easily dispatched.  We stated in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">
Notwithstanding the ill-considered dicta in the Court&#x92;s opinion in <em>Rasul</em>, 542 U.

        <p class="bodytext">    But even if petitioner were fully protected by the Clause, the DTA would create no suspension problem.

 (&#x93;Congress could, without raising any constitutional questions, provide an adequate substitute through the courts of appeals&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner has made no showing that the postdecision exclusive review by the D. C. Circuit provided in &#xA7;1005(e)(3) is inadequate to test the legality of his trial by military commission.  His principal argument is that the exclusive-review provisions are inadequate because they foreclose review of the claims he raises here.  Though petitioner&#x92;s brief does not parse the statutory language, his argument evidently rests on an erroneously narrow reading of DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  That provision grants the D. C. Circuit authority to review, &#x93;to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.&#x94;  In the quoted text, the phrase &#x93;such standards and procedures&#x94; refers to &#x93;the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (A),&#x94; namely &#x93;Military Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).&#x94;  DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(i), (e)(3)(A), <em>ibid</em>.  This Military Commission Order (Order No. 1) is the Department of Defense&#x92;s fundamental implementing order for the President&#x92;s order authorizing trials by military commission.  Order No. 1 establishes commissions, &#xA7;2; delineates their jurisdiction, &#xA7;3; provides for their officers, &#xA7;4(A); provides for their prosecution and defense counsel, &#xA7;4(B), (C); lays out all their procedures, both pretrial and trial, &#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P), &#xA7;6(A)&#x96;(G); and provides for posttrial military review through the Secretary of Defense and the President, &#xA7;6(H).  In short, the &#x93;standards and procedures specified in&#x94; Order No. 1 include <em>every aspect</em> of the military commissions, including the fact of their existence and every respect in which they differ from courts-martial.  Petitioner&#x92;s claims that the President lacks legal authority to try him before a military commission constitute claims that &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures,&#x94; as specified in Order No. 1, is &#x93;[in]consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  The D. C. Circuit thus retains jurisdiction to consider these claims on postdecision review, and the Government does not dispute that the DTA leaves unaffected our certiorari jurisdiction under

Thus, the DTA merely <em>defers</em> our jurisdiction to consider petitioner&#x92;s claims; it does not eliminate that jurisdiction.

.  In light of Congress&#x92;s provision of an alternate avenue for petitioner&#x92;s claims in &#xA7;1005(e)(3), those equitable principles counsel that we abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In requesting abstention, the Government relies principally on <em>Councilman</em>, in which we abstained from considering a serviceman&#x92;s claim that his charge for marijuana possession was not sufficiently &#x93;service-connected&#x94; to trigger the subject-matter jurisdiction of the military courts-martial.  See 420 U. S., at 740, 758.  Admittedly, <em>Councilman</em> does not squarely control petitioner&#x92;s case, but it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence.  As the Court describes, <em>ante</em>, at 21, <em>Councilman</em> &#x93;identifie[d] two considerations of comity that together favor[ed] abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings against service personnel.&#x94;  But the Court errs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this case.  Both of them, and a third consideration not emphasized in <em>Councilman</em>, all cut in favor of abstention here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, the Court observes that <em>Councilman</em> rested in part on the fact that &#x93;military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts,&#x94; and concludes that &#x93;Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  This is true enough.  But for some reason, the Court fails to make any inquiry into whether military commission trials might involve <em>other</em> &#x93;military necessities&#x94; or &#x93;unique military exigencies,&#x94; 420 U. S., at 757, comparable in gravity to those at stake in <em>Councilman</em>.  To put this in context: The charge against the respondent in <em>Councilman</em> was the off-base possession and sale of marijuana while he was stationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, see <em>id.,</em> at 739&#x96;740.  The charge against the petitioner here is joining and actively abetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thousands of innocent American civilians without warning on September 11, 2001.  While <em>Councilman</em> held that the prosecution of the former charge involved &#x93;military necessities&#x94; counseling against our interference, the Court <em>does not even ponder the same question</em> for the latter charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The reason for the Court&#x92;s &#x93;blinkered study&#x94; of this question, <em>ante</em>, at 19, is not hard to fathom.  The principal opinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe that the trials by military commission involve any &#x93;military necessity&#x94; <em>at all:</em> &#x93;The charge&#x92;s shortcomings &#x2026; are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition &#x2026; for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 48.  This is quite at odds with the views on this subject expressed by our political branches.  Because of &#x93;military necessity,&#x94; a joint session of Congress authorized the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force,&#x94; including military commissions, &#x93;against those nations, organizations, or persons [such as petitioner] he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force, &#xA7;2(a),

224, note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1541.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. &#xA7;1541</a> (2000 ed., Supp. III).  In keeping with this authority, the President has determined that &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order &#x2026; to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 2001, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e) (2002).  It is not clear where the Court derives the authority&#x97;or the audacity&#x97;to contradict this determination.  If &#x93;military necessities&#x94; relating to &#x93;duty&#x94; and &#x93;discipline&#x94; required abstention in <em>Councilman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 757, military necessities relating to the disabling, deterrence, and punishment of the mass-murdering terrorists of September 11 require abstention all the more here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court further seeks to distinguish <em>Councilman</em> on the ground that &#x93;the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  To be sure, <em>Councilman</em> emphasized that &#x93;Congress created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion, who would gain over time thorough familiarity with military problems.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 758 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).  The Court contrasts this &#x93;integrated system&#x94; insulated from military influence with the review scheme established by Order No. 1, which &#x93;provides that appeal of a review panel&#x92;s decision may be had only to the Secretary of Defense himself, &#xA7;6(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, &#xA7;6(H)(6).&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if we were to accept the Court&#x92;s extraordinary assumption that the President &#x93;lack[s] the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 23,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

                </sup>
            </a> the Court&#x92;s description of the review scheme here is anachronistic.  As of December 30, 2005, the &#x93;fina[l]&#x94; review of decisions by military commissions is now conducted by the D. C. Circuit pursuant to &#xA7;1005(e)(3) of the DTA, and by this Court under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1254.html#1" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;1254(1)</a>.  This provision for review by Article III courts creates, if anything, a review scheme <em>more</em> insulated from Executive control than that in <em>Councilman</em>.<a name="ZD-9ref" href="#ZD-9" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>9</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  At the time we decided <em>Councilman</em>, Congress had not &#x93;conferred on any Art[icle] III court jurisdiction directly to review court-martial determinations.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 746.  The final arbiter of direct appeals was the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), an Article I court whose members possessed neither life tenure, nor salary protection, nor the constitutional protection from removal provided to federal judges in Article III, &#xA7;1.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/867.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;867(a)(2)</a> (1970 ed.).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Moreover, a third consideration counsels strongly in favor of abstention in this case.  <em>Councilman</em> reasoned that the &#x93;considerations of comity, the necessity of respect for coordinate judicial systems&#x94; that motivated our decision in <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
, were inapplicable to courts-martial, because &#x93;the particular demands of federalism are not implicated.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 756, 757.  Though military commissions likewise do not implicate &#x93;the particular demands of federalism,&#x94; considerations of <em>interbranch</em> comity at the federal level weigh heavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case.  Here, apparently for the first time in history, see Motion to Dismiss 6, a District Court enjoined ongoing military commission proceedings, which had been deemed &#x93;necessary&#x94; by the President &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e).  Such an order brings the Judicial Branch into direct conflict with the Executive in an area where the Executive&#x92;s competence is maximal and ours is virtually nonexistent.  We should exercise our equitable discretion to <em>avoid</em> such conflict.  Instead, the Court rushes headlong to meet it.  Elsewhere, we have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state courts have &#x93;the first opportunity to review&#x94; a petitioner&#x92;s claim, merely to &#x93;reduc[e] friction between the state and federal court systems.&#x94;  <em>O&#x92;Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/526/838" class="subref" title="subref">526 U. S. 838</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">844</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">845</a> (1999)
.  The &#x93;friction&#x94; created today between this Court and the Executive Branch is many times more serious.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the face of such concerns, the Court relies heavily on <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/1" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 1</a> (1942)
: &#x93;Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, [in <em>Quirin</em>] we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  It is likely that the Government in <em>Quirin</em>, unlike here, preferred a hasty resolution of the case in this Court, so that it could swiftly execute the sentences imposed, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/507" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 507</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">569</a> (2004)
 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J</span>., dissenting).  But the Court&#x92;s reliance on <em>Quirin</em> suffers from a more fundamental defect: Once again, it ignores the DTA, which creates an avenue for the consideration of petitioner&#x92;s claims that did not exist at the time of <em>Quirin</em>.  Collateral application for habeas review was the <em>only</em> vehicle available.  And there was no compelling reason to postpone consideration of the <em>Quirin</em> application until the termination of military proceedings, because the only cognizable claims presented were general challenges to the authority of the commissions that would not be affected by the specific proceedings.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8&#x96;9, n. 2.  In the DTA, by contrast, Congress has expanded the scope of Article III review and has channeled it exclusively through a single, postverdict appeal to Article III courts.  Because Congress has created a novel unitary scheme of Article III review of military commissions that was absent in 1942, <em>Quirin</em> is no longer governing precedent.</p>

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-1" href="#ZD-1ref">1</a> The Court apparently believes that the effective-date provision means nothing at all.  &#x93;That paragraph (1), along with paragraphs (2) and (3), is to &#x91;take effect on the date of enactment,&#x92; DTA &#xA7;1005(h)(1),

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">317</a> (2001)
, to the effect that &#x93;a statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.&#x94;  Ante, at 14, n. 9 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).  But this quote merely restates the obvious: An effective-date provision does not render a statute applicable to &#x93;conduct that occurred at an earlier date,&#x94; but of course it renders the statute applicable to conduct that occurs on the effective date and all future dates&#x97;such as the Court&#x92;s exercise of jurisdiction here.  The Court seems to suggest that, because the effective-date provision does not authorize retroactive application, it also fails to authorize prospective application (and is thus useless verbiage).  This cannot be true.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-2" href="#ZD-2ref">2</a> A comparison with Lindh v. Murphy, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, shows this not to be true.  Subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) of &#xA7;1005 resemble the provisions of AEDPA at issue in Lindh (whose retroactivityas applied to pending cases the Lindh majority did not rule upon,see 521 U. S., at 326), in that they &#x93;g[o] beyond &#x91;mere&#x92; procedure,&#x94;id., at 327.  They impose novel and unprecedented disabilities onthe Executive Branch in its conduct of military affairs.  Subsection (e)(2) imposes judicial review on the Combatant Status ReviewTribunals (CSRTs), whose implementing order did not subject themto review by Article III courts. See Memorandum from Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz re: Order Establishing Com-batant Status Review Tribunals, at 3 &#xA7;h (July 7, 2004), avail-able at http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040707review.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 27, 2006, and availablein Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).

<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743. Historically, federal courts have never reviewed the validity of the final decision of any military commission; their jurisdiction has been restricted to considering the commission&#x92;s &#x93;lawful authority to hear, decide and condemn,&#x94;  In re Yamashita,

.  Thus, contrary to the Court&#x92;s suggestion, ante, at 17, subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) confer new jurisdiction: They impose judicial oversight on a traditionally unreviewable exercise of military authority by the Commander in Chief.  They arguably &#x93;spea[k] not just to the power of a particular court but to . . . substantive rights . . . as well,&#x94; Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Shumer,

2743.  The relevance of this observation to the abstention question is unfathomable.  The fact that Article III review is discretionary does not mean that it lacks &#x93;structural insulation from military influence,&#x94; ante, at 23, and its discretionary nature presents no obstacle to the courts&#x92; future review these cases.


The Court might more cogently have relied on the discretionary nature of review to argue that the statute provides an inadequate substitute for habeas review under the Suspension Clause.  See supra, at 16&#x96;18.  But this argument would have no force, even if all appeals to the D. C. Circuit were discretionary.  The exercise of habeas jurisdiction has traditionally been entirely a matter of the court&#x92;s equitable discretion, see Withrow v. Williams,

2742 (internal division omitted).  This provision &#x93;t[ook] effect on the date of the enactment of this Act,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(h)(1), <em>id.</em>, at 2743, which was December 30, 2005.  As of that date, then, <em>no</em> court had jurisdiction to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; the merits of petitioner&#x92;s habeas application.  This repeal of jurisdiction is simply not ambiguous as between pending and future cases.  It prohibits <em>any</em> exercise of jurisdiction, and it became effective as to <em>all</em> cases last December 30.  It is also perfectly clear that the phrase &#x93;no court, <em>justice</em>, or judge&#x94; includes this Court and its Members, and that by exercising our appellate jurisdiction in this case we are &#x93;hear[ing] or consider[ing] &#x2026; an application for a writ of habeas<span class="softbreak"/>corpus.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that statutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases pending at their effective date.  For example, in <em>Bruner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/343/112" class="subref" title="subref">343 U. S. 112</a> (1952)
, we granted certiorari to consider whether the Tucker Act&#x92;s provision denying district court jurisdiction over suits by &#x93;officers&#x94; of the United States barred a suit by an <em>employee</em> of the United States.  After we granted certiorari, Congress amended the Tucker Act by adding suits by &#x93; &#x91;employees&#x92; &#x94; to the provision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 114.  This statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district courts &#x93;became effective&#x94; while the case was pending before us, <em>ibid.</em>, and made no explicit reference to pending cases.  Because the statute &#x93;did not reserve jurisdiction over pending cases,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 115, we held that it clearly ousted jurisdiction over them.  Summarizing centuries of practice, we said: &#x93;This rule&#x97;that, when a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to pending cases, all cases fall with the law&#x97;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 116&#x96;117.

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>) (&#x93;We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction terminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not, as today&#x92;s opinion for the Court would have it, a judge-made &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11, that we have invented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes.  It is simple recognition of the reality that the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.  <em>And this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To alter this plain meaning, our cases have required an explicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdiction-repealing statute.  For example, <em>Bruner</em>, as mentioned, looked to whether Congress made &#x93;any reservation as to pending cases.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117; see also <em>id.</em>, at 115 (&#x93;Congress made no provision for cases pending at the effective date of the Act withdrawing jurisdiction and, for this reason, Courts of Appeals ordered pending cases terminated for want of jurisdiction&#x94;).  Likewise, in <em>Hallowell</em> v. <em>Commons</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/239/506" class="subref" title="subref">239 U. S. 506</a> (1916)
, Justice Holmes relied on the fact that the jurisdiction-ousting provision &#x93;made no exception for pending litigation, but purported to be universal,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 508.  And in <em>Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Ritchie</em>, 
5Wall.
541 (1867), we again relied on the fact that the jurisdictional repeal was made &#x93;without any saving of such causes as that before us,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 544.  As in <em>Bruner</em>, <em>Hallowell</em>, and <em>Ritchie</em>, the DTA&#x92;s directive that &#x93;no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742, is made &#x93;without any reservation as to pending cases&#x94; and &#x93;purport[s] to be universal.&#x94;  What we stated in an earlier case remains true here: &#x93;[W]hen, if it had been the intention to confine the operation of [the jurisdictional repeal] &#x2026; to cases not pending, it would have been so easy to have said so, we must presume that Congress meant the language employed should have its usual and ordinary signification, and that the old law should be unconditionally repealed.&#x94;  <em>Railroad Co.</em> v. <em>Grant</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    The Court claims that I &#x93;rea[d] too much into&#x94; the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases, <em>ante</em>, at 12, n. 7, and that &#x93;the <em>Bruner</em> rule&#x94; has never been &#x93;an inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19.  But the Court sorely misdescribes <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;as if it were a kind of early-day <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, resolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative inference.  On the contrary, as described above, <em>Bruner</em> stated its holding as an unqualified &#x93;rule,&#x94; which &#x93;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117.  Though <em>Bruner</em> referred to an express savings clause elsewhere in the statute, <em>id.,</em> at 115, n. 7, it disavowed any reliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain meaning, quoting <em>Ritchie</em> at length: &#x93; &#x91;It is quite possible that this effect of the [jurisdiction-stripping statute] was not contemplated by Congress&#x2026; .  [B]ut when terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention.&#x92; &#x94;  343 U. S., at 116 (quoting 5 Wall., at 544&#x96;545).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court also attempts to evade the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases by asserting that &#x93;the &#x91;presumption&#x92; [of application to pending cases] that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption&#x97;viz., the presumption against retroactivity&#x97;in certain limited circumstances.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  I have already explained that what the Court calls a &#x93;presumption&#x94; is simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous meaning of such provisions.  But even taking it to be what the Court says, the effect upon the present case would be the same.  <em>Prospective</em> applications of a statute are &#x93;effective&#x94; upon the statute&#x92;s effective date; that is what an effective-date provision like &#xA7;1005(h)(1) <em>means</em>.<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

S., at 288 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, concurring in judgments).  The Court&#x92;s &#x93;nonapplication of &#x2026; the presumption against retroactivity&#x94; to &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is thus just another way of stating that the statute takes immediate effect in pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Though the Court resists the <em>Bruner</em> rule, it cannot cite a<em> single case</em> in the history of Anglo-American law (before today) in which a jurisdiction-stripping provision was denied immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation.  By contrast, the cases granting such immediate effect are legion, and they repeatedly rely on the plain language of the jurisdictional repeal as an &#x93;inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19, by requiring an express reservation to save pending cases.

        <p class="bodytext">    Disregarding the plain meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the requirement of explicit exception set forth in the foregoing cases, the Court instead favors &#x93;a negative inference &#x2026; from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 13.  Specifically, it appeals to the fact that &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) are explicitly made applicable to pending cases (by &#xA7;1005(h)(2)).  A negative inference of the sort the Court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an ambiguous provision, but since the meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear, the omitted language in that context would have been redundant.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if &#xA7;1005(e)(1) were at all ambiguous in its application to pending cases, the &#x93;negative inference&#x94; from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) touted by the Court would have no force.  The numerous cases in the <em>Bruner</em> line would at least create a powerful default &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11.  The negative inference urged by the Court would be a particularly awkward and indirect way of rebutting such a longstanding and consistent practice.  This is especially true since the negative inference that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(h)(2)&#x92;s specification that certain provisions <em>shall</em> apply to pending cases is matched by a negative inference in the opposite direction that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(b)(2), which provides that certain provisions shall <em>not </em>apply to pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court&#x92;s reliance on our opinion in <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, is utterly misplaced.  <em>Lindh</em> involved two provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA): a set of amendments to chapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined the scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts; and a provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas statute specially to govern federal collateral review of state capital cases.  See 521 U. S., at 326&#x96;327.  The latter provision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applicable to cases pending at the time of AEDPA&#x92;s enactment; the former made no specific reference to pending cases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 327.  In <em>Lindh</em>, we drew a negative inference from chapter 154&#x92;s explicit reference to pending cases, to conclude that the chapter 153 amendments did <em>not</em> apply in pending cases.  It was essential to our reasoning, however, that both provisions appeared to be <em>identically difficult</em> to classify under our retroactivity cases.  First, we noted that, after <em>Landgraf</em>, there was reason for Congress to suppose that an explicit statement was required to render the amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending cases, because the new chapter 154 &#x93;will have substantive as well as purely procedural effects.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 327.  The next step&#x97;and the critical step&#x97;in our reasoning was that Congress had <em>identical</em> reason to suppose that an explicit statement would be required to apply the chapter 153 amendments to pending cases, but did not provide it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  The negative inference of <em>Lindh</em> rested on the fact that &#x93;[n]othing &#x2026; but a different intent explain[ed] the different treatment.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Here, by contrast, there is ample reason for the different treatment.  The exclusive-review provisions of the DTA, unlike both &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the AEDPA amendments in <em>Lindh</em>, confer <em>new</em> jurisdiction (in the D. C. Circuit)  where there was none before.  For better or for worse, our recent cases have contrasted jurisdiction-<em>creating</em> provisions with jurisdiction-<em>ousting</em> provisions, retaining the venerable rule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied in pending cases, but strongly indicating that the former are typically retroactive.  For example, we stated in <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)
, that a statute &#x93;that <em>creates</em> jurisdiction where none previously existed&#x94; is &#x93;as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other.&#x94;  See also <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>,

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J</span>.); <em>id.</em>, at 722 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy</span>, J., dissenting).  The Court gives our retroactivity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that &#x93;subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents.&#x94;<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            <em>Ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18.  This statement rises to the level of sarcasm when one considers its author&#x92;s description of the governing test of our retroactivity jurisprudence:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The conclusion that a particular rule operates &#x91;retroactively&#x92; comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.  Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.  However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have &#x91;sound &#x2026; instinct[s],&#x92; &#x2026; and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 270 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The only &#x93;familiar consideration,&#x94; &#x93;reasonable reliance,&#x94; and &#x93;settled expectation&#x94; I am aware of pertaining to the present case is the rule of <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;applicable to &#xA7;1005(e)(1), but not to &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)&#x97;which the Court stubbornly disregards.  It is utterly beyond question that &#xA7;1005(e)(2)&#x92;s and (3)&#x92;s application to pending cases (without explicit specification) was not as clear as &#xA7;1005(e)(1)&#x92;s.  That is alone enough to explain the difference in treatment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Another obvious reason for the specification was to stave off any Suspension Clause problems raised by the immediately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by subsection (e)(1).  That is to say, specification of the immediate effectiveness of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) (which, unlike subsection (e)(1), would not fall within the <em>Bruner </em>rule and would not <em>automatically</em> be deemed applicable in pending cases) could reasonably have been thought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas jurisdiction that subsection (e)(1) eliminated in pending cases with an adequate substitute.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These considerations by no means prove that an explicit statement would be <em>required</em> to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable in pending cases.  But they surely gave Congress ample reason to <em>doubt</em> that their application in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the Court glibly assumes.  In any event, even if it were true that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x93; &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18, this would merely establish that subsection (h)(2)&#x92;s reference to pending cases was wholly superfluous when applied to subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3), just as it would have been for subsection (e)(1).  <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference makes sense only when Congress would have perceived &#x93;the wisdom of being explicit&#x94; with respect to the immediate application of <em>both</em> of two statutory provisions, 521 U. S., at 328, but chose to be explicit only for one of them&#x97;not when it would have perceived <em>no need </em>to be explicit for both, but enacted a redundancy only for one.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, it is simply untrue that Congress &#x93; &#x91;should have been just as concerned about&#x92; &#x94; specifying the application of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) to pending cases, <em>ante</em>, at 14 (quoting <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329).  In fact, the negative-inference approach of <em>Lindh</em> is particularly inappropriate in this case, because the negative inference from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) would tend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that <em>are</em> explicitly rendered applicable in pending cases, &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3).  Those provisions purport to vest &#x93;exclusive&#x94; jurisdiction in the D. C. Circuit to consider the claims raised by petitioners here.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.  By drawing a negative inference <em>&lt;fs fs="11.5"&gt;&amp;Agrave;</em>
            <em>la</em>
            <em>Lindh</em>, the Court supplants this exclusive-review mechanism with a dual-review mechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to file applications challenging the CSRTs or military commissions before December 30, 2005.  Whatever the force of <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference in other cases, it surely should not apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision from which the negative inference is drawn.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Worst of all is the Court&#x92;s reliance on the legislative history of the DTA to buttress its implausible reading of &#xA7;1005(e)(1).  We have repeatedly held that such reliance is impermissible where, as here, the statutory language is unambiguous.  But the Court nevertheless relies both on floor statements from the Senate and (quite heavily) on the drafting history of the DTA.  To begin with floor statements: The Court urges that some &#x93;statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to&#x94; the Court&#x92;s interpretation, citing excerpts from the floor debate that support its view, <em>ante</em>, 15&#x96;16, n. 10.  The Court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor statements by the DTA&#x92;s sponsors that flatly contradict its view, because &#x93;those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record <em>after</em> the Senate debate.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Of course this observation, even if true, makes no difference unless one indulges the fantasy that Senate floor speeches are attended (like the Philippics of Demosthenes) by throngs of eager listeners, instead of being delivered (like Demosthenes&#x92; practice sessions on the beach) alone into a vast emptiness.  Whether the floor statements are spoken where no Senator hears, or written where no Senator reads, they represent at most the views of a single Senator.  In any event, the Court greatly exaggerates the one-sidedness of the portions of the floor debate that clearly occurred before the DTA&#x92;s enactment.  Some of the statements of Senator Graham, a sponsor of the bill, only make sense on the assumption that pending cases are covered.<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    But selectivity is not the greatest vice in the Court&#x92;s use of floor statements to resolve today&#x92;s case.  These statements were made when Members of Congress were fully aware that our continuing jurisdiction <em>over this very case</em> was at issue.  The question was divisive, and floor statements made on both sides were undoubtedly opportunistic and crafted <em>solely</em> for use in the briefs in this very litigation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 151 Cong. Rec. S14257&#x96;S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen.

The Court&#x92;s reliance on such statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar opportunism.  In a virtually identical context, the author of today&#x92;s opinion has written for the Court that &#x93;[t]he legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U.

Likewise, the handful of floor statements that the Court treats as authoritative do not &#x93;reflec[t] any general agreement.&#x94;  They reflect the now-common tactic&#x97;which the Court once again rewards&#x97;of pursuing through floor-speech <em>ipse dixit</em> what could not be achieved through the constitutionally prescribed method of putting language into a bill that a majority of both Houses vote for and the President signs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the floor statements, at least the Court shows some semblance of seemly shame, tucking away its reference to them in a half-hearted footnote.  Not so for its reliance on the DTA&#x92;s drafting history, which is displayed prominently, see <em>ante</em>, at 14&#x96;15.  I have explained elsewhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or reliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute than any other form of legislative history.  This case presents a textbook example of its unreliability.  The Court, <em>ante</em>, at 14, trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the Senate included redundant language, not included in the DTA as passed, reconfirming that the abolition of habeas jurisdiction &#x93;shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.&#x94;  151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005).  But this earlier version of the bill also differed from the DTA in other material respects.  Most notably, it provided for postdecision review by the D. C. Circuit only of the decisions of <em>CSRTs</em>, not military commissions, <em>ibid.; </em>and it limited that review to whether &#x93;the status determination &#x2026; was consistent with the procedures and standards specified by the Secretary of Defense,&#x94; <em>ibid.,</em> not whether &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures &#x2026; is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742.  To say that what moved Senators to reject this earlier bill was the &#x93;action that is pending&#x94; provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even this Court&#x92;s greatest Justices.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  And to think that the House and the President also had this rejection firmly in mind is absurd.  As always&#x97;but <em>especially</em> in the context of strident, partisan legislative conflict of the sort that characterized enactment of this legislation&#x97;the language of the statute that was actually passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President is our only authoritative and only reliable guidepost.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A final but powerful indication of the fact that the Court has made a mess of this statute is the nature of the consequences that ensue.  Though this case concerns a habeas application challenging a trial by military commission, DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(1) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider <em>any</em> &#x93;application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  The vast majority of pending petitions, no doubt, do not relate to military commissions at all, but to more commonly challenged aspects of &#x93;detention&#x94; such as the terms and conditions of confinement.  See <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/466" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 466</a>,

 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  The Solicitor General represents that &#x93;[h]abeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a purported 600 [Guantanamo Bay] detainees,&#x94; including one that &#x93;seek[s] relief on behalf of every Guantanamo detainee who has not already filed an action,&#x94; Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 20, n. 10 (hereinafter Motion to Dismiss).  The Court&#x92;s interpretation transforms a provision abolishing jurisdiction over <em>all</em> Guantanamo-related habeas petitions into a provision that retains jurisdiction over cases sufficiently numerous to keep the courts busy for years to come.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Because I would hold that &#xA7;1005(e)(1) unambiguously terminates the jurisdiction of all courts to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; pending habeas applications, I must confront petitioner&#x92;s arguments that the provision, so interpreted, violates the Suspension Clause.  This claim is easily dispatched.  We stated in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;We are cited to no instance where a court, in this or any other country where the writ is known, has issued it on behalf of an alien enemy who, at no relevant time and in no stage of his captivity, has been within its territorial jurisdiction.  Nothing in the text of the Constitution extends such a right, nor does anything in our statutes.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Notwithstanding the ill-considered dicta in the Court&#x92;s opinion in <em>Rasul</em>, 542 U. S., at 480&#x96;481, it is clear that Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is outside the sovereign &#x93;territorial jurisdiction&#x94; of the United States.  See <em>id.</em>, at 500&#x96;505 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  Petitioner, an enemy alien detained abroad, has no rights under the Suspension Clause.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But even if petitioner were fully protected by the Clause, the DTA would create no suspension problem.  This Court has repeatedly acknowledged that &#x93;the substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person&#x92;s detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.&#x94;  <em>Swain</em> v. <em>Pressley</em>,

 (&#x93;Congress could, without raising any constitutional questions, provide an adequate substitute through the courts of appeals&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner has made no showing that the postdecision exclusive review by the D. C. Circuit provided in &#xA7;1005(e)(3) is inadequate to test the legality of his trial by military commission.  His principal argument is that the exclusive-review provisions are inadequate because they foreclose review of the claims he raises here.  Though petitioner&#x92;s brief does not parse the statutory language, his argument evidently rests on an erroneously narrow reading of DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  That provision grants the D. C. Circuit authority to review, &#x93;to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.&#x94;  In the quoted text, the phrase &#x93;such standards and procedures&#x94; refers to &#x93;the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (A),&#x94; namely &#x93;Military Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).&#x94;  DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(i), (e)(3)(A), <em>ibid</em>.  This Military Commission Order (Order No. 1) is the Department of Defense&#x92;s fundamental implementing order for the President&#x92;s order authorizing trials by military commission.  Order No. 1 establishes commissions, &#xA7;2; delineates their jurisdiction, &#xA7;3; provides for their officers, &#xA7;4(A); provides for their prosecution and defense counsel, &#xA7;4(B), (C); lays out all their procedures, both pretrial and trial, &#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P), &#xA7;6(A)&#x96;(G); and provides for posttrial military review through the Secretary of Defense and the President, &#xA7;6(H).  In short, the &#x93;standards and procedures specified in&#x94; Order No. 1 include <em>every aspect</em> of the military commissions, including the fact of their existence and every respect in which they differ from courts-martial.  Petitioner&#x92;s claims that the President lacks legal authority to try him before a military commission constitute claims that &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures,&#x94; as specified in Order No. 1, is &#x93;[in]consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  The D. C. Circuit thus retains jurisdiction to consider these claims on postdecision review, and the Government does not dispute that the DTA leaves unaffected our certiorari jurisdiction under

Thus, the DTA merely <em>defers</em> our jurisdiction to consider petitioner&#x92;s claims; it does not eliminate that jurisdiction.  It constitutes neither an &#x93;inadequate&#x94; nor an &#x93;ineffective&#x94; substitute for petitioner&#x92;s pending habeas application.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Though it does not squarely address the issue, the Court hints ominously that &#x93;the Government&#x92;s preferred reading&#x94; would &#x93;rais[e] grave questions about Congress&#x92; authority to impinge upon this Court&#x92;s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 10&#x96;11 (citing <em>Ex parte Yerger</em>, 
8Wall.
85 (1869); <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin</em>,

128 (1872); and <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506).  It is not clear how there could be any such lurking questions, in light of the aptly named &#x93;<em>Exceptions</em> Clause&#x94; of Article III, &#xA7;2, which, in making our appellate jurisdiction subject to &#x93;such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make,&#x94; explicitly permits exactly what Congress has done here.  But any doubt our prior cases might have created on this score is surely chimerical in <em>this</em> case.  As just noted, the exclusive-review provisions provide a substitute for habeas review adequate to satisfy the Suspension Clause, which <em>forbids</em> the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.  <em>A fortiori</em> they provide a substitute adequate to satisfy any implied substantive limitations, whether real or imaginary, upon the Exceptions Clause, which <em>authorizes</em> such exceptions as &#xA7;1005(e)(1).</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if Congress had not clearly and constitutionally eliminated jurisdiction over this case, neither this Court nor the lower courts ought to exercise it.  Traditionally, equitable principles govern both the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and the granting of the injunctive relief sought by petitioner.  See <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">311</a> (1982)
.  In light of Congress&#x92;s provision of an alternate avenue for petitioner&#x92;s claims in &#xA7;1005(e)(3), those equitable principles counsel that we abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In requesting abstention, the Government relies principally on <em>Councilman</em>, in which we abstained from considering a serviceman&#x92;s claim that his charge for marijuana possession was not sufficiently &#x93;service-connected&#x94; to trigger the subject-matter jurisdiction of the military courts-martial.  See 420 U. S., at 740, 758.  Admittedly, <em>Councilman</em> does not squarely control petitioner&#x92;s case, but it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence.  As the Court describes, <em>ante</em>, at 21, <em>Councilman</em> &#x93;identifie[d] two considerations of comity that together favor[ed] abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings against service personnel.&#x94;  But the Court errs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this case.  Both of them, and a third consideration not emphasized in <em>Councilman</em>, all cut in favor of abstention here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, the Court observes that <em>Councilman</em> rested in part on the fact that &#x93;military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts,&#x94; and concludes that &#x93;Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  This is true enough.  But for some reason, the Court fails to make any inquiry into whether military commission trials might involve <em>other</em> &#x93;military necessities&#x94; or &#x93;unique military exigencies,&#x94; 420 U. S., at 757, comparable in gravity to those at stake in <em>Councilman</em>.  To put this in context: The charge against the respondent in <em>Councilman</em> was the off-base possession and sale of marijuana while he was stationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, see <em>id.,</em> at 739&#x96;740.  The charge against the petitioner here is joining and actively abetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thousands of innocent American civilians without warning on September 11, 2001.  While <em>Councilman</em> held that the prosecution of the former charge involved &#x93;military necessities&#x94; counseling against our interference, the Court <em>does not even ponder the same question</em> for the latter charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The reason for the Court&#x92;s &#x93;blinkered study&#x94; of this question, <em>ante</em>, at 19, is not hard to fathom.  The principal opinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe that the trials by military commission involve any &#x93;military necessity&#x94; <em>at all:</em> &#x93;The charge&#x92;s shortcomings &#x2026; are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition &#x2026; for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 48.  This is quite at odds with the views on this subject expressed by our political branches.  Because of &#x93;military necessity,&#x94; a joint session of Congress authorized the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force,&#x94; including military commissions, &#x93;against those nations, organizations, or persons [such as petitioner] he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force, &#xA7;2(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224, note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1541.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. &#xA7;1541</a> (2000 ed., Supp. III).  In keeping with this authority, the President has determined that &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order &#x2026; to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 2001, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e) (2002).  It is not clear where the Court derives the authority&#x97;or the audacity&#x97;to contradict this determination.  If &#x93;military necessities&#x94; relating to &#x93;duty&#x94; and &#x93;discipline&#x94; required abstention in <em>Councilman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 757, military necessities relating to the disabling, deterrence, and punishment of the mass-murdering terrorists of September 11 require abstention all the more here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court further seeks to distinguish <em>Councilman</em> on the ground that &#x93;the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  To be sure, <em>Councilman</em> emphasized that &#x93;Congress created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion, who would gain over time thorough familiarity with military problems.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 758 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).  The Court contrasts this &#x93;integrated system&#x94; insulated from military influence with the review scheme established by Order No. 1, which &#x93;provides that appeal of a review panel&#x92;s decision may be had only to the Secretary of Defense himself, &#xA7;6(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, &#xA7;6(H)(6).&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if we were to accept the Court&#x92;s extraordinary assumption that the President &#x93;lack[s] the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 23,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

            </a> the Court&#x92;s description of the review scheme here is anachronistic.  As of December 30, 2005, the &#x93;fina[l]&#x94; review of decisions by military commissions is now conducted by the D. C. Circuit pursuant to &#xA7;1005(e)(3) of the DTA, and by this Court under

This provision for review by Article III courts creates, if anything, a review scheme <em>more</em> insulated from Executive control than that in <em>Councilman</em>.<a name="ZD-9ref" href="#ZD-9" class="">

                    <b>9</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  At the time we decided <em>Councilman</em>, Congress had not &#x93;conferred on any Art[icle] III court jurisdiction directly to review court-martial determinations.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 746.  The final arbiter of direct appeals was the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), an Article I court whose members possessed neither life tenure, nor salary protection, nor the constitutional protection from removal provided to federal judges in Article III, &#xA7;1.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/867.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;867(a)(2)</a> (1970 ed.).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Moreover, a third consideration counsels strongly in favor of abstention in this case.  <em>Councilman</em> reasoned that the &#x93;considerations of comity, the necessity of respect for coordinate judicial systems&#x94; that motivated our decision in <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
, were inapplicable to courts-martial, because &#x93;the particular demands of federalism are not implicated.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 756, 757.  Though military commissions likewise do not implicate &#x93;the particular demands of federalism,&#x94; considerations of <em>interbranch</em> comity at the federal level weigh heavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case.  Here, apparently for the first time in history, see Motion to Dismiss 6, a District Court enjoined ongoing military commission proceedings, which had been deemed &#x93;necessary&#x94; by the President &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e).  Such an order brings the Judicial Branch into direct conflict with the Executive in an area where the Executive&#x92;s competence is maximal and ours is virtually nonexistent.  We should exercise our equitable discretion to <em>avoid</em> such conflict.  Instead, the Court rushes headlong to meet it.  Elsewhere, we have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state courts have &#x93;the first opportunity to review&#x94; a petitioner&#x92;s claim, merely to &#x93;reduc[e] friction between the state and federal court systems.&#x94;  <em>O&#x92;Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/526/838" class="subref" title="subref">526 U. S. 838</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">845</a> (1999)
.  The &#x93;friction&#x94; created today between this Court and the Executive Branch is many times more serious.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the face of such concerns, the Court relies heavily on <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/1" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 1</a> (1942)
: &#x93;Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, [in <em>Quirin</em>] we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  It is likely that the Government in <em>Quirin</em>, unlike here, preferred a hasty resolution of the case in this Court, so that it could swiftly execute the sentences imposed, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/507" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 507</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">569</a> (2004)
 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J</span>., dissenting).  But the Court&#x92;s reliance on <em>Quirin</em> suffers from a more fundamental defect: Once again, it ignores the DTA, which creates an avenue for the consideration of petitioner&#x92;s claims that did not exist at the time of <em>Quirin</em>.  Collateral application for habeas review was the <em>only</em> vehicle available.  And there was no compelling reason to postpone consideration of the <em>Quirin</em> application until the termination of military proceedings, because the only cognizable claims presented were general challenges to the authority of the commissions that would not be affected by the specific proceedings.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8&#x96;9, n. 2.  In the DTA, by contrast, Congress has expanded the scope of Article III review and has channeled it exclusively through a single, postverdict appeal to Article III courts.  Because Congress has created a novel unitary scheme of Article III review of military commissions that was absent in 1942, <em>Quirin</em> is no longer governing precedent.</p>

Subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) of &#xA7;1005 resemble the provisions of AEDPA at issue in Lindh (whose retroactivityas applied to pending cases the Lindh majority did not rule upon,see 521 U.

2743. Historically, federal courts have never reviewed the validity of the final decision of any military commission; their jurisdiction has been restricted to considering the commission&#x92;s &#x93;lawful authority to hear, decide and condemn,&#x94;  In re Yamashita,

Thus, contrary to the Court&#x92;s suggestion, ante, at 17, subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) confer new jurisdiction: They impose judicial oversight on a traditionally unreviewable exercise of military authority by the Commander in Chief.

2743.  The relevance of this observation to the abstention question is unfathomable.  The fact that Article III review is discretionary does not mean that it lacks &#x93;structural insulation from military influence,&#x94; ante, at 23, and its discretionary nature presents no obstacle to the courts&#x92; future review these cases.


The Court might more cogently have relied on the discretionary nature of review to argue that the statute provides an inadequate substitute for habeas review under the Suspension Clause.  See supra, at 16&#x96;18.  But this argument would have no force, even if all appeals to the D. C. Circuit were discretionary.  The exercise of habeas jurisdiction has traditionally been entirely a matter of the court&#x92;s equitable discretion, see Withrow v. Williams,

        <p class="bodytext">    On December 30, 2005, Congress enacted the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA).  It unambiguously provides that, as of that date, &#x93;no court, justice, or judge&#x94; shall have jurisdiction to consider the habeas application of a Guantanamo Bay detainee.  Notwithstanding this plain directive, the Court today concludes that, on what it calls the statute&#x92;s <em>most natural</em> reading, <em>every</em> &#x93;court, justice, or judge&#x94; before whom such a habeas application was pending on December 30 has jurisdiction to hear, consider, and render judgment on it.  This conclusion is patently erroneous.  And even if it were not, the jurisdiction supposedly retained should, in an exercise of sound equitable discretion, not be exercised.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">I</p>
        <p class="opcentered">A</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The DTA provides: &#x93;[N]o court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction to hear or consider an application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742 (internal division omitted).  This provision &#x93;t[ook] effect on the date of the enactment of this Act,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(h)(1), <em>id.</em>, at 2743, which was December 30, 2005.  As of that date, then, <em>no</em> court had jurisdiction to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; the merits of petitioner&#x92;s habeas application.  This repeal of jurisdiction is simply not ambiguous as between pending and future cases.  It prohibits <em>any</em> exercise of jurisdiction, and it became effective as to <em>all</em> cases last December 30.  It is also perfectly clear that the phrase &#x93;no court, <em>justice</em>, or judge&#x94; includes this Court and its Members, and that by exercising our appellate jurisdiction in this case we are &#x93;hear[ing] or consider[ing] &#x2026; an application for a writ of habeas<span class="softbreak"/>corpus.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    An ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that statutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases pending at their effective date.  For example, in <em>Bruner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/343/112" class="subref" title="subref">343 U. S. 112</a> (1952)
, we granted certiorari to consider whether the Tucker Act&#x92;s provision denying district court jurisdiction over suits by &#x93;officers&#x94; of the United States barred a suit by an <em>employee</em> of the United States.  After we granted certiorari, Congress amended the Tucker Act by adding suits by &#x93; &#x91;employees&#x92; &#x94; to the provision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 114.  This statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district courts &#x93;became effective&#x94; while the case was pending before us, <em>ibid.</em>, and made no explicit reference to pending cases.  Because the statute &#x93;did not reserve jurisdiction over pending cases,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 115, we held that it clearly ousted jurisdiction over them.  Summarizing centuries of practice, we said: &#x93;This rule&#x97;that, when a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to pending cases, all cases fall with the law&#x97;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 116&#x96;117.

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>) (&#x93;We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction terminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not, as today&#x92;s opinion for the Court would have it, a judge-made &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11, that we have invented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes.  It is simple recognition of the reality that the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.  <em>And this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To alter this plain meaning, our cases have required an explicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdiction-repealing statute.  For example, <em>Bruner</em>, as mentioned, looked to whether Congress made &#x93;any reservation as to pending cases.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117; see also <em>id.</em>, at 115 (&#x93;Congress made no provision for cases pending at the effective date of the Act withdrawing jurisdiction and, for this reason, Courts of Appeals ordered pending cases terminated for want of jurisdiction&#x94;).  Likewise, in <em>Hallowell</em> v. <em>Commons</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/239/506" class="subref" title="subref">239 U. S. 506</a> (1916)
, Justice Holmes relied on the fact that the jurisdiction-ousting provision &#x93;made no exception for pending litigation, but purported to be universal,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 508.  And in <em>Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Ritchie</em>, 
5Wall.
541 (1867), we again relied on the fact that the jurisdictional repeal was made &#x93;without any saving of such causes as that before us,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 544.  As in <em>Bruner</em>, <em>Hallowell</em>, and <em>Ritchie</em>, the DTA&#x92;s directive that &#x93;no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742, is made &#x93;without any reservation as to pending cases&#x94; and &#x93;purport[s] to be universal.&#x94;  What we stated in an earlier case remains true here: &#x93;[W]hen, if it had been the intention to confine the operation of [the jurisdictional repeal] &#x2026; to cases not pending, it would have been so easy to have said so, we must presume that Congress meant the language employed should have its usual and ordinary signification, and that the old law should be unconditionally repealed.&#x94;  <em>Railroad Co.</em> v. <em>Grant</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    The Court claims that I &#x93;rea[d] too much into&#x94; the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases, <em>ante</em>, at 12, n. 7, and that &#x93;the <em>Bruner</em> rule&#x94; has never been &#x93;an inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19.  But the Court sorely misdescribes <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;as if it were a kind of early-day <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, resolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative inference.  On the contrary, as described above, <em>Bruner</em> stated its holding as an unqualified &#x93;rule,&#x94; which &#x93;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117.  Though <em>Bruner</em> referred to an express savings clause elsewhere in the statute, <em>id.,</em> at 115, n. 7, it disavowed any reliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain meaning, quoting <em>Ritchie</em> at length: &#x93; &#x91;It is quite possible that this effect of the [jurisdiction-stripping statute] was not contemplated by Congress&#x2026; .  [B]ut when terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention.&#x92; &#x94;  343 U. S., at 116 (quoting 5 Wall., at 544&#x96;545).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court also attempts to evade the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases by asserting that &#x93;the &#x91;presumption&#x92; [of application to pending cases] that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption&#x97;viz., the presumption against retroactivity&#x97;in certain limited circumstances.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  I have already explained that what the Court calls a &#x93;presumption&#x94; is simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous meaning of such provisions.  But even taking it to be what the Court says, the effect upon the present case would be the same.  <em>Prospective</em> applications of a statute are &#x93;effective&#x94; upon the statute&#x92;s effective date; that is what an effective-date provision like &#xA7;1005(h)(1) <em>means</em>.<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

            </a>  &#x93; &#x91;[S]hall take effect upon enactment&#x92; is presumed to mean &#x91;shall have prospective effect upon enactment,&#x92; and that presumption is too strong to be overcome by any negative inference [drawn from other provisions of the statute].&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 288 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, concurring in judgments).  The Court&#x92;s &#x93;nonapplication of &#x2026; the presumption against retroactivity&#x94; to &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is thus just another way of stating that the statute takes immediate effect in pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Though the Court resists the <em>Bruner</em> rule, it cannot cite a<em> single case</em> in the history of Anglo-American law (before today) in which a jurisdiction-stripping provision was denied immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation.  By contrast, the cases granting such immediate effect are legion, and they repeatedly rely on the plain language of the jurisdictional repeal as an &#x93;inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19, by requiring an express reservation to save pending cases.

        <p class="bodytext">    Disregarding the plain meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the requirement of explicit exception set forth in the foregoing cases, the Court instead favors &#x93;a negative inference &#x2026; from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 13.  Specifically, it appeals to the fact that &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) are explicitly made applicable to pending cases (by &#xA7;1005(h)(2)).  A negative inference of the sort the Court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an ambiguous provision, but since the meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear, the omitted language in that context would have been redundant.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if &#xA7;1005(e)(1) were at all ambiguous in its application to pending cases, the &#x93;negative inference&#x94; from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) touted by the Court would have no force.  The numerous cases in the <em>Bruner</em> line would at least create a powerful default &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11.  The negative inference urged by the Court would be a particularly awkward and indirect way of rebutting such a longstanding and consistent practice.  This is especially true since the negative inference that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(h)(2)&#x92;s specification that certain provisions <em>shall</em> apply to pending cases is matched by a negative inference in the opposite direction that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(b)(2), which provides that certain provisions shall <em>not </em>apply to pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court&#x92;s reliance on our opinion in <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, is utterly misplaced.  <em>Lindh</em> involved two provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA): a set of amendments to chapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined the scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts; and a provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas statute specially to govern federal collateral review of state capital cases.  See 521 U. S., at 326&#x96;327.  The latter provision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applicable to cases pending at the time of AEDPA&#x92;s enactment; the former made no specific reference to pending cases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 327.  In <em>Lindh</em>, we drew a negative inference from chapter 154&#x92;s explicit reference to pending cases, to conclude that the chapter 153 amendments did <em>not</em> apply in pending cases.  It was essential to our reasoning, however, that both provisions appeared to be <em>identically difficult</em> to classify under our retroactivity cases.  First, we noted that, after <em>Landgraf</em>, there was reason for Congress to suppose that an explicit statement was required to render the amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending cases, because the new chapter 154 &#x93;will have substantive as well as purely procedural effects.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 327.  The next step&#x97;and the critical step&#x97;in our reasoning was that Congress had <em>identical</em> reason to suppose that an explicit statement would be required to apply the chapter 153 amendments to pending cases, but did not provide it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  The negative inference of <em>Lindh</em> rested on the fact that &#x93;[n]othing &#x2026; but a different intent explain[ed] the different treatment.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Here, by contrast, there is ample reason for the different treatment.  The exclusive-review provisions of the DTA, unlike both &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the AEDPA amendments in <em>Lindh</em>, confer <em>new</em> jurisdiction (in the D. C. Circuit)  where there was none before.  For better or for worse, our recent cases have contrasted jurisdiction-<em>creating</em> provisions with jurisdiction-<em>ousting</em> provisions, retaining the venerable rule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied in pending cases, but strongly indicating that the former are typically retroactive.  For example, we stated in <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)
, that a statute &#x93;that <em>creates</em> jurisdiction where none previously existed&#x94; is &#x93;as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other.&#x94;  See also <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>,

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J</span>.); <em>id.</em>, at 722 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy</span>, J., dissenting).  The Court gives our retroactivity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that &#x93;subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents.&#x94;<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            <em>Ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18.  This statement rises to the level of sarcasm when one considers its author&#x92;s description of the governing test of our retroactivity jurisprudence:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The conclusion that a particular rule operates &#x91;retroactively&#x92; comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.  Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.  However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have &#x91;sound &#x2026; instinct[s],&#x92; &#x2026; and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 270 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The only &#x93;familiar consideration,&#x94; &#x93;reasonable reliance,&#x94; and &#x93;settled expectation&#x94; I am aware of pertaining to the present case is the rule of <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;applicable to &#xA7;1005(e)(1), but not to &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)&#x97;which the Court stubbornly disregards.  It is utterly beyond question that &#xA7;1005(e)(2)&#x92;s and (3)&#x92;s application to pending cases (without explicit specification) was not as clear as &#xA7;1005(e)(1)&#x92;s.  That is alone enough to explain the difference in treatment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Another obvious reason for the specification was to stave off any Suspension Clause problems raised by the immediately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by subsection (e)(1).  That is to say, specification of the immediate effectiveness of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) (which, unlike subsection (e)(1), would not fall within the <em>Bruner </em>rule and would not <em>automatically</em> be deemed applicable in pending cases) could reasonably have been thought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas jurisdiction that subsection (e)(1) eliminated in pending cases with an adequate substitute.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These considerations by no means prove that an explicit statement would be <em>required</em> to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable in pending cases.  But they surely gave Congress ample reason to <em>doubt</em> that their application in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the Court glibly assumes.  In any event, even if it were true that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x93; &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18, this would merely establish that subsection (h)(2)&#x92;s reference to pending cases was wholly superfluous when applied to subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3), just as it would have been for subsection (e)(1).  <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference makes sense only when Congress would have perceived &#x93;the wisdom of being explicit&#x94; with respect to the immediate application of <em>both</em> of two statutory provisions, 521 U. S., at 328, but chose to be explicit only for one of them&#x97;not when it would have perceived <em>no need </em>to be explicit for both, but enacted a redundancy only for one.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, it is simply untrue that Congress &#x93; &#x91;should have been just as concerned about&#x92; &#x94; specifying the application of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) to pending cases, <em>ante</em>, at 14 (quoting <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329).  In fact, the negative-inference approach of <em>Lindh</em> is particularly inappropriate in this case, because the negative inference from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) would tend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that <em>are</em> explicitly rendered applicable in pending cases, &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3).  Those provisions purport to vest &#x93;exclusive&#x94; jurisdiction in the D. C. Circuit to consider the claims raised by petitioners here.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.  By drawing a negative inference <em>&lt;fs fs="11.5"&gt;&amp;Agrave;</em>
            <em>la</em>
            <em>Lindh</em>, the Court supplants this exclusive-review mechanism with a dual-review mechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to file applications challenging the CSRTs or military commissions before December 30, 2005.  Whatever the force of <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference in other cases, it surely should not apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision from which the negative inference is drawn.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Worst of all is the Court&#x92;s reliance on the legislative history of the DTA to buttress its implausible reading of &#xA7;1005(e)(1).  We have repeatedly held that such reliance is impermissible where, as here, the statutory language is unambiguous.  But the Court nevertheless relies both on floor statements from the Senate and (quite heavily) on the drafting history of the DTA.  To begin with floor statements: The Court urges that some &#x93;statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to&#x94; the Court&#x92;s interpretation, citing excerpts from the floor debate that support its view, <em>ante</em>, 15&#x96;16, n. 10.  The Court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor statements by the DTA&#x92;s sponsors that flatly contradict its view, because &#x93;those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record <em>after</em> the Senate debate.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Of course this observation, even if true, makes no difference unless one indulges the fantasy that Senate floor speeches are attended (like the Philippics of Demosthenes) by throngs of eager listeners, instead of being delivered (like Demosthenes&#x92; practice sessions on the beach) alone into a vast emptiness.  Whether the floor statements are spoken where no Senator hears, or written where no Senator reads, they represent at most the views of a single Senator.  In any event, the Court greatly exaggerates the one-sidedness of the portions of the floor debate that clearly occurred before the DTA&#x92;s enactment.  Some of the statements of Senator Graham, a sponsor of the bill, only make sense on the assumption that pending cases are covered.<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

            </a>  And at least one opponent of the DTA unmistakably expressed his understanding that it would terminate our jurisdiction in this very case.<a name="ZD-4ref" href="#ZD-4" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    But selectivity is not the greatest vice in the Court&#x92;s use of floor statements to resolve today&#x92;s case.  These statements were made when Members of Congress were fully aware that our continuing jurisdiction <em>over this very case</em> was at issue.  The question was divisive, and floor statements made on both sides were undoubtedly opportunistic and crafted <em>solely</em> for use in the briefs in this very litigation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 151 Cong. Rec. S14257&#x96;S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen. Levin) (arguing against a reading that would &#x93;stri[p] the Federal courts of jurisdiction to consider pending cases, <em>including the Hamdan case now pending in the Supreme Court</em>,&#x94; and urging that <em>Lindh</em> requires the same negative inference that the Court indulges today (emphasis added)).  The Court&#x92;s reliance on such statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar opportunism.  In a virtually identical context, the author of today&#x92;s opinion has written for the Court that &#x93;[t]he legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 262 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).  Likewise, the handful of floor statements that the Court treats as authoritative do not &#x93;reflec[t] any general agreement.&#x94;  They reflect the now-common tactic&#x97;which the Court once again rewards&#x97;of pursuing through floor-speech <em>ipse dixit</em> what could not be achieved through the constitutionally prescribed method of putting language into a bill that a majority of both Houses vote for and the President signs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the floor statements, at least the Court shows some semblance of seemly shame, tucking away its reference to them in a half-hearted footnote.  Not so for its reliance on the DTA&#x92;s drafting history, which is displayed prominently, see <em>ante</em>, at 14&#x96;15.  I have explained elsewhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or reliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute than any other form of legislative history.  This case presents a textbook example of its unreliability.  The Court, <em>ante</em>, at 14, trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the Senate included redundant language, not included in the DTA as passed, reconfirming that the abolition of habeas jurisdiction &#x93;shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.&#x94;  151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005).  But this earlier version of the bill also differed from the DTA in other material respects.  Most notably, it provided for postdecision review by the D. C. Circuit only of the decisions of <em>CSRTs</em>, not military commissions, <em>ibid.; </em>and it limited that review to whether &#x93;the status determination &#x2026; was consistent with the procedures and standards specified by the Secretary of Defense,&#x94; <em>ibid.,</em> not whether &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures &#x2026; is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742.  To say that what moved Senators to reject this earlier bill was the &#x93;action that is pending&#x94; provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even this Court&#x92;s greatest Justices.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

                </sup>
            </a>  And to think that the House and the President also had this rejection firmly in mind is absurd.  As always&#x97;but <em>especially</em> in the context of strident, partisan legislative conflict of the sort that characterized enactment of this legislation&#x97;the language of the statute that was actually passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President is our only authoritative and only reliable guidepost.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A final but powerful indication of the fact that the Court has made a mess of this statute is the nature of the consequences that ensue.  Though this case concerns a habeas application challenging a trial by military commission, DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(1) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider <em>any</em> &#x93;application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  The vast majority of pending petitions, no doubt, do not relate to military commissions at all, but to more commonly challenged aspects of &#x93;detention&#x94; such as the terms and conditions of confinement.  See <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/466" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 466</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">498</a> (2004)
 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  The Solicitor General represents that &#x93;[h]abeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a purported 600 [Guantanamo Bay] detainees,&#x94; including one that &#x93;seek[s] relief on behalf of every Guantanamo detainee who has not already filed an action,&#x94; Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 20, n. 10 (hereinafter Motion to Dismiss).  The Court&#x92;s interpretation transforms a provision abolishing jurisdiction over <em>all</em> Guantanamo-related habeas petitions into a provision that retains jurisdiction over cases sufficiently numerous to keep the courts busy for years to come.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Because I would hold that &#xA7;1005(e)(1) unambiguously terminates the jurisdiction of all courts to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; pending habeas applications, I must confront petitioner&#x92;s arguments that the provision, so interpreted, violates the Suspension Clause.  This claim is easily dispatched.  We stated in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;We are cited to no instance where a court, in this or any other country where the writ is known, has issued it on behalf of an alien enemy who, at no relevant time and in no stage of his captivity, has been within its territorial jurisdiction.  Nothing in the text of the Constitution extends such a right, nor does anything in our statutes.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Notwithstanding the ill-considered dicta in the Court&#x92;s opinion in <em>Rasul</em>, 542 U.

See <em>id.</em>, at 500&#x96;505 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  Petitioner, an enemy alien detained abroad, has no rights under the Suspension Clause.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But even if petitioner were fully protected by the Clause, the DTA would create no suspension problem.  This Court has repeatedly acknowledged that &#x93;the substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person&#x92;s detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.&#x94;  <em>Swain</em> v. <em>Pressley</em>,

 (&#x93;Congress could, without raising any constitutional questions, provide an adequate substitute through the courts of appeals&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner has made no showing that the postdecision exclusive review by the D. C. Circuit provided in &#xA7;1005(e)(3) is inadequate to test the legality of his trial by military commission.  His principal argument is that the exclusive-review provisions are inadequate because they foreclose review of the claims he raises here.  Though petitioner&#x92;s brief does not parse the statutory language, his argument evidently rests on an erroneously narrow reading of DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  That provision grants the D. C. Circuit authority to review, &#x93;to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.&#x94;  In the quoted text, the phrase &#x93;such standards and procedures&#x94; refers to &#x93;the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (A),&#x94; namely &#x93;Military Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).&#x94;  DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(i), (e)(3)(A), <em>ibid</em>.  This Military Commission Order (Order No. 1) is the Department of Defense&#x92;s fundamental implementing order for the President&#x92;s order authorizing trials by military commission.  Order No. 1 establishes commissions, &#xA7;2; delineates their jurisdiction, &#xA7;3; provides for their officers, &#xA7;4(A); provides for their prosecution and defense counsel, &#xA7;4(B), (C); lays out all their procedures, both pretrial and trial, &#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P), &#xA7;6(A)&#x96;(G); and provides for posttrial military review through the Secretary of Defense and the President, &#xA7;6(H).  In short, the &#x93;standards and procedures specified in&#x94; Order No. 1 include <em>every aspect</em> of the military commissions, including the fact of their existence and every respect in which they differ from courts-martial.  Petitioner&#x92;s claims that the President lacks legal authority to try him before a military commission constitute claims that &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures,&#x94; as specified in Order No. 1, is &#x93;[in]consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  The D. C. Circuit thus retains jurisdiction to consider these claims on postdecision review, and the Government does not dispute that the DTA leaves unaffected our certiorari jurisdiction under

Thus, the DTA merely <em>defers</em> our jurisdiction to consider petitioner&#x92;s claims; it does not eliminate that jurisdiction.  It constitutes neither an &#x93;inadequate&#x94; nor an &#x93;ineffective&#x94; substitute for petitioner&#x92;s pending habeas application.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

But any doubt our prior cases might have created on this score is surely chimerical in <em>this</em> case.  As just noted, the exclusive-review provisions provide a substitute for habeas review adequate to satisfy the Suspension Clause, which <em>forbids</em> the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.  <em>A fortiori</em> they provide a substitute adequate to satisfy any implied substantive limitations, whether real or imaginary, upon the Exceptions Clause, which <em>authorizes</em> such exceptions as &#xA7;1005(e)(1).</p>

See 420 U. S., at 740, 758.  Admittedly, <em>Councilman</em> does not squarely control petitioner&#x92;s case, but it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence.  As the Court describes, <em>ante</em>, at 21, <em>Councilman</em> &#x93;identifie[d] two considerations of comity that together favor[ed] abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings against service personnel.&#x94;  But the Court errs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this case.

        <p class="bodytext">    First, the Court observes that <em>Councilman</em> rested in part on the fact that &#x93;military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts,&#x94; and concludes that &#x93;Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  This is true enough.  But for some reason, the Court fails to make any inquiry into whether military commission trials might involve <em>other</em> &#x93;military necessities&#x94; or &#x93;unique military exigencies,&#x94; 420 U. S., at 757, comparable in gravity to those at stake in <em>Councilman</em>.  To put this in context: The charge against the respondent in <em>Councilman</em> was the off-base possession and sale of marijuana while he was stationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, see <em>id.,</em> at 739&#x96;740.  The charge against the petitioner here is joining and actively abetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thousands of innocent American civilians without warning on September 11, 2001.  While <em>Councilman</em> held that the prosecution of the former charge involved &#x93;military necessities&#x94; counseling against our interference, the Court <em>does not even ponder the same question</em> for the latter charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The reason for the Court&#x92;s &#x93;blinkered study&#x94; of this question, <em>ante</em>, at 19, is not hard to fathom.  The principal opinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe that the trials by military commission involve any &#x93;military necessity&#x94; <em>at all:</em> &#x93;The charge&#x92;s shortcomings &#x2026; are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition &#x2026; for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 48.  This is quite at odds with the views on this subject expressed by our political branches.  Because of &#x93;military necessity,&#x94; a joint session of Congress authorized the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force,&#x94; including military commissions, &#x93;against those nations, organizations, or persons [such as petitioner] he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force, &#xA7;2(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224, note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1541.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. &#xA7;1541</a> (2000 ed., Supp. III).  In keeping with this authority, the President has determined that &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order &#x2026; to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 2001, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e) (2002).  It is not clear where the Court derives the authority&#x97;or the audacity&#x97;to contradict this determination.  If &#x93;military necessities&#x94; relating to &#x93;duty&#x94; and &#x93;discipline&#x94; required abstention in <em>Councilman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 757, military necessities relating to the disabling, deterrence, and punishment of the mass-murdering terrorists of September 11 require abstention all the more here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court further seeks to distinguish <em>Councilman</em> on the ground that &#x93;the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  To be sure, <em>Councilman</em> emphasized that &#x93;Congress created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion, who would gain over time thorough familiarity with military problems.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 758 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).  The Court contrasts this &#x93;integrated system&#x94; insulated from military influence with the review scheme established by Order No. 1, which &#x93;provides that appeal of a review panel&#x92;s decision may be had only to the Secretary of Defense himself, &#xA7;6(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, &#xA7;6(H)(6).&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if we were to accept the Court&#x92;s extraordinary assumption that the President &#x93;lack[s] the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 23,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">
                <sup>

                </sup>
            </a> the Court&#x92;s description of the review scheme here is anachronistic.  As of December 30, 2005, the &#x93;fina[l]&#x94; review of decisions by military commissions is now conducted by the D. C. Circuit pursuant to &#xA7;1005(e)(3) of the DTA, and by this Court under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/1254.html#1" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;1254(1)</a>.  This provision for review by Article III courts creates, if anything, a review scheme <em>more</em> insulated from Executive control than that in <em>Councilman</em>.<a name="ZD-9ref" href="#ZD-9" class="">
                <sup>
                    <b>9</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  At the time we decided <em>Councilman</em>, Congress had not &#x93;conferred on any Art[icle] III court jurisdiction directly to review court-martial determinations.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 746.  The final arbiter of direct appeals was the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), an Article I court whose members possessed neither life tenure, nor salary protection, nor the constitutional protection from removal provided to federal judges in Article III, &#xA7;1.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/867.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;867(a)(2)</a> (1970 ed.).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Moreover, a third consideration counsels strongly in favor of abstention in this case.  <em>Councilman</em> reasoned that the &#x93;considerations of comity, the necessity of respect for coordinate judicial systems&#x94; that motivated our decision in <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
, were inapplicable to courts-martial, because &#x93;the particular demands of federalism are not implicated.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 756, 757.  Though military commissions likewise do not implicate &#x93;the particular demands of federalism,&#x94; considerations of <em>interbranch</em> comity at the federal level weigh heavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case.  Here, apparently for the first time in history, see Motion to Dismiss 6, a District Court enjoined ongoing military commission proceedings, which had been deemed &#x93;necessary&#x94; by the President &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e).  Such an order brings the Judicial Branch into direct conflict with the Executive in an area where the Executive&#x92;s competence is maximal and ours is virtually nonexistent.  We should exercise our equitable discretion to <em>avoid</em> such conflict.  Instead, the Court rushes headlong to meet it.  Elsewhere, we have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state courts have &#x93;the first opportunity to review&#x94; a petitioner&#x92;s claim, merely to &#x93;reduc[e] friction between the state and federal court systems.&#x94;  <em>O&#x92;Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/526/838" class="subref" title="subref">526 U. S. 838</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">844</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">845</a> (1999)
.  The &#x93;friction&#x94; created today between this Court and the Executive Branch is many times more serious.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the face of such concerns, the Court relies heavily on <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/1" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 1</a> (1942)
: &#x93;Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, [in <em>Quirin</em>] we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  It is likely that the Government in <em>Quirin</em>, unlike here, preferred a hasty resolution of the case in this Court, so that it could swiftly execute the sentences imposed, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/507" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 507</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">569</a> (2004)
 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J</span>., dissenting).  But the Court&#x92;s reliance on <em>Quirin</em> suffers from a more fundamental defect: Once again, it ignores the DTA, which creates an avenue for the consideration of petitioner&#x92;s claims that did not exist at the time of <em>Quirin</em>.  Collateral application for habeas review was the <em>only</em> vehicle available.  And there was no compelling reason to postpone consideration of the <em>Quirin</em> application until the termination of military proceedings, because the only cognizable claims presented were general challenges to the authority of the commissions that would not be affected by the specific proceedings.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8&#x96;9, n. 2.  In the DTA, by contrast, Congress has expanded the scope of Article III review and has channeled it exclusively through a single, postverdict appeal to Article III courts.  Because Congress has created a novel unitary scheme of Article III review of military commissions that was absent in 1942, <em>Quirin</em> is no longer governing precedent.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    I would abstain from exercising our equity jurisdiction, as the Government requests.</p>

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-1" href="#ZD-1ref">1</a> The Court apparently believes that the effective-date provision means nothing at all.  &#x93;That paragraph (1), along with paragraphs (2) and (3), is to &#x91;take effect on the date of enactment,&#x92; DTA &#xA7;1005(h)(1),

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">317</a> (2001)
, to the effect that &#x93;a statement that a statute will become effective on a certain date does not even arguably suggest that it has any application to conduct that occurred at an earlier date.&#x94;  Ante, at 14, n. 9 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks omitted).  But this quote merely restates the obvious: An effective-date provision does not render a statute applicable to &#x93;conduct that occurred at an earlier date,&#x94; but of course it renders the statute applicable to conduct that occurs on the effective date and all future dates&#x97;such as the Court&#x92;s exercise of jurisdiction here.  The Court seems to suggest that, because the effective-date provision does not authorize retroactive application, it also fails to authorize prospective application (and is thus useless verbiage).  This cannot be true.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-2" href="#ZD-2ref">2</a> A comparison with Lindh v. Murphy, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, shows this not to be true.  Subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) of &#xA7;1005 resemble the provisions of AEDPA at issue in Lindh (whose retroactivityas applied to pending cases the Lindh majority did not rule upon,see 521 U. S., at 326), in that they &#x93;g[o] beyond &#x91;mere&#x92; procedure,&#x94;id., at 327.  They impose novel and unprecedented disabilities onthe Executive Branch in its conduct of military affairs.  Subsection (e)(2) imposes judicial review on the Combatant Status ReviewTribunals (CSRTs), whose implementing order did not subject themto review by Article III courts. See Memorandum from Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz re: Order Establishing Com-batant Status Review Tribunals, at 3 &#xA7;h (July 7, 2004), avail-able at http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040707review.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 27, 2006, and availablein Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  Subsection (e)(3) authorizes the D. C. Circuit to review &#x93;the validity of any final decision rendered pursuant to Military Commission Order No. 1,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(A), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743. Historically, federal courts have never reviewed the validity of the final decision of any military commission; their jurisdiction has been restricted to considering the commission&#x92;s &#x93;lawful authority to hear, decide and condemn,&#x94;  In re Yamashita, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/1" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 1</a>,

.  Thus, contrary to the Court&#x92;s suggestion, ante, at 17, subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) confer new jurisdiction: They impose judicial oversight on a traditionally unreviewable exercise of military authority by the Commander in Chief.  They arguably &#x93;spea[k] not just to the power of a particular court but to . . . substantive rights . . . as well,&#x94; Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Shumer,

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-9" href="#ZD-9ref">9</a> In rejecting our analysis, the Court observes that appeals to the D. C.

2743.  The relevance of this observation to the abstention question is unfathomable.  The fact that Article III review is discretionary does not mean that it lacks &#x93;structural insulation from military influence,&#x94; ante, at 23, and its discretionary nature presents no obstacle to the courts&#x92; future review these cases.


The Court might more cogently have relied on the discretionary nature of review to argue that the statute provides an inadequate substitute for habeas review under the Suspension Clause.  See supra, at 16&#x96;18.  But this argument would have no force, even if all appeals to the D. C. Circuit were discretionary.  The exercise of habeas jurisdiction has traditionally been entirely a matter of the court&#x92;s equitable discretion, see Withrow v. Williams,

        <p class="bodytext">    On December 30, 2005, Congress enacted the Detainee Treatment Act (DTA).  It unambiguously provides that, as of that date, &#x93;no court, justice, or judge&#x94; shall have jurisdiction to consider the habeas application of a Guantanamo Bay detainee.  Notwithstanding this plain directive, the Court today concludes that, on what it calls the statute&#x92;s <em>most natural</em> reading, <em>every</em> &#x93;court, justice, or judge&#x94; before whom such a habeas application was pending on December 30 has jurisdiction to hear, consider, and render judgment on it.  This conclusion is patently erroneous.  And even if it were not, the jurisdiction supposedly retained should, in an exercise of sound equitable discretion, not be exercised.</p>

As of that date, then, <em>no</em> court had jurisdiction to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; the merits of petitioner&#x92;s habeas application.  This repeal of jurisdiction is simply not ambiguous as between pending and future cases.  It prohibits <em>any</em> exercise of jurisdiction, and it became effective as to <em>all</em> cases last December 30.

        <p class="bodytext">    An ancient and unbroken line of authority attests that statutes ousting jurisdiction unambiguously apply to cases pending at their effective date.  For example, in <em>Bruner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/343/112" class="subref" title="subref">343 U. S. 112</a> (1952)
, we granted certiorari to consider whether the Tucker Act&#x92;s provision denying district court jurisdiction over suits by &#x93;officers&#x94; of the United States barred a suit by an <em>employee</em> of the United States.  After we granted certiorari, Congress amended the Tucker Act by adding suits by &#x93; &#x91;employees&#x92; &#x94; to the provision barring jurisdiction over suits by officers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 114.  This statute narrowing the jurisdiction of the district courts &#x93;became effective&#x94; while the case was pending before us, <em>ibid.</em>, and made no explicit reference to pending cases.  Because the statute &#x93;did not reserve jurisdiction over pending cases,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 115, we held that it clearly ousted jurisdiction over them.  Summarizing centuries of practice, we said: &#x93;This rule&#x97;that, when a law conferring jurisdiction is repealed without any reservation as to pending cases, all cases fall with the law&#x97;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  <em>Id.</em>, at 116&#x96;117.

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>) (&#x93;We have regularly applied intervening statutes conferring or ousting jurisdiction, whether or not jurisdiction lay when the underlying conduct occurred or when the suit was filed&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    This venerable rule that statutes ousting jurisdiction terminate jurisdiction in pending cases is not, as today&#x92;s opinion for the Court would have it, a judge-made &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11, that we have invented to resolve an ambiguity in the statutes.  It is simple recognition of the reality that the <em>plain import</em> of a statute repealing jurisdiction is to eliminate the power to consider and render judgment&#x97;in an already pending case no less than in a case yet to be filed.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;Without jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any cause.  Jurisdiction is power to declare the law, and when it ceases to exist, the only function remaining to the court is that of announcing the fact and dismissing the cause.  <em>And this is not less clear upon authority than upon principle</em>.&#x94;  <em>Ex parte McCardle</em>, 7 Wall. 506, 514 (1869) (emphasis added).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    To alter this plain meaning, our cases have required an explicit reservation of pending cases in the jurisdiction-repealing statute.  For example, <em>Bruner</em>, as mentioned, looked to whether Congress made &#x93;any reservation as to pending cases.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117; see also <em>id.</em>, at 115 (&#x93;Congress made no provision for cases pending at the effective date of the Act withdrawing jurisdiction and, for this reason, Courts of Appeals ordered pending cases terminated for want of jurisdiction&#x94;).  Likewise, in <em>Hallowell</em> v. <em>Commons</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/239/506" class="subref" title="subref">239 U. S. 506</a> (1916)
, Justice Holmes relied on the fact that the jurisdiction-ousting provision &#x93;made no exception for pending litigation, but purported to be universal,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 508.  And in <em>Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Ritchie</em>, 
5Wall.
541 (1867), we again relied on the fact that the jurisdictional repeal was made &#x93;without any saving of such causes as that before us,&#x94; <em>id.</em>, at 544.  As in <em>Bruner</em>, <em>Hallowell</em>, and <em>Ritchie</em>, the DTA&#x92;s directive that &#x93;no court, justice, or judge shall have jurisdiction,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(1), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742, is made &#x93;without any reservation as to pending cases&#x94; and &#x93;purport[s] to be universal.&#x94;  What we stated in an earlier case remains true here: &#x93;[W]hen, if it had been the intention to confine the operation of [the jurisdictional repeal] &#x2026; to cases not pending, it would have been so easy to have said so, we must presume that Congress meant the language employed should have its usual and ordinary signification, and that the old law should be unconditionally repealed.&#x94;  <em>Railroad Co.</em> v. <em>Grant</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">    The Court claims that I &#x93;rea[d] too much into&#x94; the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases, <em>ante</em>, at 12, n. 7, and that &#x93;the <em>Bruner</em> rule&#x94; has never been &#x93;an inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19.  But the Court sorely misdescribes <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;as if it were a kind of early-day <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, resolving statutory ambiguity by oblique negative inference.  On the contrary, as described above, <em>Bruner</em> stated its holding as an unqualified &#x93;rule,&#x94; which &#x93;has been adhered to consistently by this Court.&#x94;  343 U. S., at 116&#x96;117.  Though <em>Bruner</em> referred to an express savings clause elsewhere in the statute, <em>id.,</em> at 115, n. 7, it disavowed any reliance on such oblique indicators to vary the plain meaning, quoting <em>Ritchie</em> at length: &#x93; &#x91;It is quite possible that this effect of the [jurisdiction-stripping statute] was not contemplated by Congress&#x2026; .  [B]ut when terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention.&#x92; &#x94;  343 U. S., at 116 (quoting 5 Wall., at 544&#x96;545).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court also attempts to evade the <em>Bruner</em> line of cases by asserting that &#x93;the &#x91;presumption&#x92; [of application to pending cases] that these cases have applied is more accurately viewed as the nonapplication of another presumption&#x97;viz., the presumption against retroactivity&#x97;in certain limited circumstances.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  I have already explained that what the Court calls a &#x93;presumption&#x94; is simply the acknowledgment of the unambiguous meaning of such provisions.  But even taking it to be what the Court says, the effect upon the present case would be the same.  <em>Prospective</em> applications of a statute are &#x93;effective&#x94; upon the statute&#x92;s effective date; that is what an effective-date provision like &#xA7;1005(h)(1) <em>means</em>.<a name="ZD-1ref" href="#ZD-1" class="">

S., at 288 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, concurring in judgments).  The Court&#x92;s &#x93;nonapplication of &#x2026; the presumption against retroactivity&#x94; to &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is thus just another way of stating that the statute takes immediate effect in pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Though the Court resists the <em>Bruner</em> rule, it cannot cite a<em> single case</em> in the history of Anglo-American law (before today) in which a jurisdiction-stripping provision was denied immediate effect in pending cases, absent an explicit statutory reservation.  By contrast, the cases granting such immediate effect are legion, and they repeatedly rely on the plain language of the jurisdictional repeal as an &#x93;inflexible trump,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 19, by requiring an express reservation to save pending cases.

        <p class="bodytext">    Disregarding the plain meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the requirement of explicit exception set forth in the foregoing cases, the Court instead favors &#x93;a negative inference &#x2026; from the exclusion of language from one statutory provision that is included in other provisions of the same statute,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 13.  Specifically, it appeals to the fact that &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (e)(3) are explicitly made applicable to pending cases (by &#xA7;1005(h)(2)).  A negative inference of the sort the Court relies upon might clarify the meaning of an ambiguous provision, but since the meaning of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) is entirely clear, the omitted language in that context would have been redundant.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if &#xA7;1005(e)(1) were at all ambiguous in its application to pending cases, the &#x93;negative inference&#x94; from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) touted by the Court would have no force.  The numerous cases in the <em>Bruner</em> line would at least create a powerful default &#x93;presumption against jurisdiction,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 11.  The negative inference urged by the Court would be a particularly awkward and indirect way of rebutting such a longstanding and consistent practice.  This is especially true since the negative inference that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(h)(2)&#x92;s specification that certain provisions <em>shall</em> apply to pending cases is matched by a negative inference in the opposite direction that might be drawn from &#xA7;1005(b)(2), which provides that certain provisions shall <em>not </em>apply to pending cases.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court&#x92;s reliance on our opinion in <em>Lindh</em> v. <em>Murphy</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/521/320" class="subref" title="subref">521 U. S. 320</a> (1997)
, is utterly misplaced.  <em>Lindh</em> involved two provisions of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA): a set of amendments to chapter 153 of the federal habeas statute that redefined the scope of collateral review by federal habeas courts; and a provision creating a new chapter 154 in the habeas statute specially to govern federal collateral review of state capital cases.  See 521 U. S., at 326&#x96;327.  The latter provision explicitly rendered the new chapter 154 applicable to cases pending at the time of AEDPA&#x92;s enactment; the former made no specific reference to pending cases.  <em>Id.</em>, at 327.  In <em>Lindh</em>, we drew a negative inference from chapter 154&#x92;s explicit reference to pending cases, to conclude that the chapter 153 amendments did <em>not</em> apply in pending cases.  It was essential to our reasoning, however, that both provisions appeared to be <em>identically difficult</em> to classify under our retroactivity cases.  First, we noted that, after <em>Landgraf</em>, there was reason for Congress to suppose that an explicit statement was required to render the amendments to chapter 154 applicable in pending cases, because the new chapter 154 &#x93;will have substantive as well as purely procedural effects.&#x94;  521 U. S., at 327.  The next step&#x97;and the critical step&#x97;in our reasoning was that Congress had <em>identical</em> reason to suppose that an explicit statement would be required to apply the chapter 153 amendments to pending cases, but did not provide it.  <em>Id.</em>, at 329.  The negative inference of <em>Lindh</em> rested on the fact that &#x93;[n]othing &#x2026; but a different intent explain[ed] the different treatment.&#x94;  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Here, by contrast, there is ample reason for the different treatment.  The exclusive-review provisions of the DTA, unlike both &#xA7;1005(e)(1) and the AEDPA amendments in <em>Lindh</em>, confer <em>new</em> jurisdiction (in the D. C. Circuit)  where there was none before.  For better or for worse, our recent cases have contrasted jurisdiction-<em>creating</em> provisions with jurisdiction-<em>ousting</em> provisions, retaining the venerable rule that the latter are not retroactive even when applied in pending cases, but strongly indicating that the former are typically retroactive.  For example, we stated in <em>Hughes Aircraft Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Schumer</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/520/939" class="subref" title="subref">520 U. S. 939</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">951</a> (1997)
, that a statute &#x93;that <em>creates</em> jurisdiction where none previously existed&#x94; is &#x93;as much subject to our presumption against retroactivity as any other.&#x94;  See also <em>Republic of Austria</em> v. <em>Altmann</em>,

 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J</span>.); <em>id.</em>, at 722 (<span class="smallcaps">Kennedy</span>, J., dissenting).  The Court gives our retroactivity jurisprudence a dazzling clarity in asserting that &#x93;subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions under our precedents.&#x94;<a name="ZD-2ref" href="#ZD-2" class="">

            <em>Ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18.  This statement rises to the level of sarcasm when one considers its author&#x92;s description of the governing test of our retroactivity jurisprudence:</p>
        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;The conclusion that a particular rule operates &#x91;retroactively&#x92; comes at the end of a process of judgment concerning the nature and extent of the change in the law and the degree of connection between the operation of the new rule and a relevant past event.  Any test of retroactivity will leave room for disagreement in hard cases, and is unlikely to classify the enormous variety of legal changes with perfect philosophical clarity.  However, retroactivity is a matter on which judges tend to have &#x91;sound &#x2026; instinct[s],&#x92; &#x2026; and familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations offer sound guidance.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 270 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
The only &#x93;familiar consideration,&#x94; &#x93;reasonable reliance,&#x94; and &#x93;settled expectation&#x94; I am aware of pertaining to the present case is the rule of <em>Bruner</em>&#x97;applicable to &#xA7;1005(e)(1), but not to &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3)&#x97;which the Court stubbornly disregards.  It is utterly beyond question that &#xA7;1005(e)(2)&#x92;s and (3)&#x92;s application to pending cases (without explicit specification) was not as clear as &#xA7;1005(e)(1)&#x92;s.  That is alone enough to explain the difference in treatment.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Another obvious reason for the specification was to stave off any Suspension Clause problems raised by the immediately effective ouster of jurisdiction brought about by subsection (e)(1).  That is to say, specification of the immediate effectiveness of subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) (which, unlike subsection (e)(1), would not fall within the <em>Bruner </em>rule and would not <em>automatically</em> be deemed applicable in pending cases) could reasonably have been thought essential to be sure of replacing the habeas jurisdiction that subsection (e)(1) eliminated in pending cases with an adequate substitute.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    These considerations by no means prove that an explicit statement would be <em>required</em> to render subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) applicable in pending cases.  But they surely gave Congress ample reason to <em>doubt</em> that their application in pending cases would unfold as naturally as the Court glibly assumes.  In any event, even if it were true that subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) &#x93; &#x91;confer&#x92; jurisdiction in a manner that cannot conceivably give rise to retroactivity questions,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 17&#x96;18, this would merely establish that subsection (h)(2)&#x92;s reference to pending cases was wholly superfluous when applied to subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3), just as it would have been for subsection (e)(1).  <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference makes sense only when Congress would have perceived &#x93;the wisdom of being explicit&#x94; with respect to the immediate application of <em>both</em> of two statutory provisions, 521 U. S., at 328, but chose to be explicit only for one of them&#x97;not when it would have perceived <em>no need </em>to be explicit for both, but enacted a redundancy only for one.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In short, it is simply untrue that Congress &#x93; &#x91;should have been just as concerned about&#x92; &#x94; specifying the application of &#xA7;1005(e)(1) to pending cases, <em>ante</em>, at 14 (quoting <em>Lindh</em>, 521 U. S., at 329).  In fact, the negative-inference approach of <em>Lindh</em> is particularly inappropriate in this case, because the negative inference from &#xA7;1005(h)(2) would tend to defeat the purpose of the very provisions that <em>are</em> explicitly rendered applicable in pending cases, &#xA7;1005(e)(2) and (3).  Those provisions purport to vest &#x93;exclusive&#x94; jurisdiction in the D. C. Circuit to consider the claims raised by petitioners here.  See <em>infra</em>, at 16&#x96;18.  By drawing a negative inference <em>&lt;fs fs="11.5"&gt;&amp;Agrave;</em>
            <em>la</em>
            <em>Lindh</em>, the Court supplants this exclusive-review mechanism with a dual-review mechanism for petitioners who were expeditious enough to file applications challenging the CSRTs or military commissions before December 30, 2005.  Whatever the force of <em>Lindh</em>&#x92;s negative inference in other cases, it surely should not apply here to defeat the purpose of the very provision from which the negative inference is drawn.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">C</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Worst of all is the Court&#x92;s reliance on the legislative history of the DTA to buttress its implausible reading of &#xA7;1005(e)(1).  We have repeatedly held that such reliance is impermissible where, as here, the statutory language is unambiguous.  But the Court nevertheless relies both on floor statements from the Senate and (quite heavily) on the drafting history of the DTA.  To begin with floor statements: The Court urges that some &#x93;statements made by Senators preceding passage of the Act lend further support to&#x94; the Court&#x92;s interpretation, citing excerpts from the floor debate that support its view, <em>ante</em>, 15&#x96;16, n. 10.  The Court immediately goes on to discount numerous floor statements by the DTA&#x92;s sponsors that flatly contradict its view, because &#x93;those statements appear to have been inserted into the Congressional Record <em>after</em> the Senate debate.&#x94;  <em>Ibid.</em>  Of course this observation, even if true, makes no difference unless one indulges the fantasy that Senate floor speeches are attended (like the Philippics of Demosthenes) by throngs of eager listeners, instead of being delivered (like Demosthenes&#x92; practice sessions on the beach) alone into a vast emptiness.  Whether the floor statements are spoken where no Senator hears, or written where no Senator reads, they represent at most the views of a single Senator.  In any event, the Court greatly exaggerates the one-sidedness of the portions of the floor debate that clearly occurred before the DTA&#x92;s enactment.  Some of the statements of Senator Graham, a sponsor of the bill, only make sense on the assumption that pending cases are covered.<a name="ZD-3ref" href="#ZD-3" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    But selectivity is not the greatest vice in the Court&#x92;s use of floor statements to resolve today&#x92;s case.  These statements were made when Members of Congress were fully aware that our continuing jurisdiction <em>over this very case</em> was at issue.  The question was divisive, and floor statements made on both sides were undoubtedly opportunistic and crafted <em>solely</em> for use in the briefs in this very litigation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 151 Cong. Rec. S14257&#x96;S14258 (Dec. 21, 2005) (statement of Sen. Levin) (arguing against a reading that would &#x93;stri[p] the Federal courts of jurisdiction to consider pending cases, <em>including the Hamdan case now pending in the Supreme Court</em>,&#x94; and urging that <em>Lindh</em> requires the same negative inference that the Court indulges today (emphasis added)).  The Court&#x92;s reliance on such statements cannot avoid the appearance of similar opportunism.  In a virtually identical context, the author of today&#x92;s opinion has written for the Court that &#x93;[t]he legislative history discloses some frankly partisan statements about the meaning of the final effective date language, but those statements cannot plausibly be read as reflecting any general agreement.&#x94;  <em>Landgraf</em>, 511 U. S., at 262 (opinion for the Court by <span class="smallcaps">Stevens, J.</span>).  Likewise, the handful of floor statements that the Court treats as authoritative do not &#x93;reflec[t] any general agreement.&#x94;  They reflect the now-common tactic&#x97;which the Court once again rewards&#x97;of pursuing through floor-speech <em>ipse dixit</em> what could not be achieved through the constitutionally prescribed method of putting language into a bill that a majority of both Houses vote for and the President signs.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    With regard to the floor statements, at least the Court shows some semblance of seemly shame, tucking away its reference to them in a half-hearted footnote.  Not so for its reliance on the DTA&#x92;s drafting history, which is displayed prominently, see <em>ante</em>, at 14&#x96;15.  I have explained elsewhere that such drafting history is no more legitimate or reliable an indicator of the objective meaning of a statute than any other form of legislative history.  This case presents a textbook example of its unreliability.  The Court, <em>ante</em>, at 14, trumpets the fact that a bill considered in the Senate included redundant language, not included in the DTA as passed, reconfirming that the abolition of habeas jurisdiction &#x93;shall apply to any application or other action that is pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.&#x94;  151 Cong. Rec. S12655 (Nov. 10, 2005).  But this earlier version of the bill also differed from the DTA in other material respects.  Most notably, it provided for postdecision review by the D. C. Circuit only of the decisions of <em>CSRTs</em>, not military commissions, <em>ibid.; </em>and it limited that review to whether &#x93;the status determination &#x2026; was consistent with the procedures and standards specified by the Secretary of Defense,&#x94; <em>ibid.,</em> not whether &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures &#x2026; is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(2)(C)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2742.  To say that what moved Senators to reject this earlier bill was the &#x93;action that is pending&#x94; provision surpasses the intuitive powers of even this Court&#x92;s greatest Justices.<a name="ZD-6ref" href="#ZD-6" class="">

            </a>  And to think that the House and the President also had this rejection firmly in mind is absurd.  As always&#x97;but <em>especially</em> in the context of strident, partisan legislative conflict of the sort that characterized enactment of this legislation&#x97;the language of the statute that was actually passed by both Houses of Congress and signed by the President is our only authoritative and only reliable guidepost.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">D</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    A final but powerful indication of the fact that the Court has made a mess of this statute is the nature of the consequences that ensue.  Though this case concerns a habeas application challenging a trial by military commission, DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(1) strips the courts of jurisdiction to hear or consider <em>any</em> &#x93;application for a writ of habeas corpus filed by or on behalf of an alien detained by the Department of Defense at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.&#x94;  The vast majority of pending petitions, no doubt, do not relate to military commissions at all, but to more commonly challenged aspects of &#x93;detention&#x94; such as the terms and conditions of confinement.  See <em>Rasul</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/466" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 466</a>,

 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  The Solicitor General represents that &#x93;[h]abeas petitions have been filed on behalf of a purported 600 [Guantanamo Bay] detainees,&#x94; including one that &#x93;seek[s] relief on behalf of every Guantanamo detainee who has not already filed an action,&#x94; Respondents&#x92; Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction 20, n. 10 (hereinafter Motion to Dismiss).  The Court&#x92;s interpretation transforms a provision abolishing jurisdiction over <em>all</em> Guantanamo-related habeas petitions into a provision that retains jurisdiction over cases sufficiently numerous to keep the courts busy for years to come.</p>
        <p class="opcentered">II</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Because I would hold that &#xA7;1005(e)(1) unambiguously terminates the jurisdiction of all courts to &#x93;hear or consider&#x94; pending habeas applications, I must confront petitioner&#x92;s arguments that the provision, so interpreted, violates the Suspension Clause.  This claim is easily dispatched.  We stated in <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Eisentrager</em>,

        <p class="bodytext">&#x93;We are cited to no instance where a court, in this or any other country where the writ is known, has issued it on behalf of an alien enemy who, at no relevant time and in no stage of his captivity, has been within its territorial jurisdiction.  Nothing in the text of the Constitution extends such a right, nor does anything in our statutes.&#x94;</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
Notwithstanding the ill-considered dicta in the Court&#x92;s opinion in <em>Rasul</em>, 542 U. S., at 480&#x96;481, it is clear that Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, is outside the sovereign &#x93;territorial jurisdiction&#x94; of the United States.  See <em>id.</em>, at 500&#x96;505 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J.</span>, dissenting).  Petitioner, an enemy alien detained abroad, has no rights under the Suspension Clause.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    But even if petitioner were fully protected by the Clause, the DTA would create no suspension problem.  This Court has repeatedly acknowledged that &#x93;the substitution of a collateral remedy which is neither inadequate nor ineffective to test the legality of a person&#x92;s detention does not constitute a suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.&#x94;  <em>Swain</em> v. <em>Pressley</em>,

 (&#x93;Congress could, without raising any constitutional questions, provide an adequate substitute through the courts of appeals&#x94;).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Petitioner has made no showing that the postdecision exclusive review by the D. C. Circuit provided in &#xA7;1005(e)(3) is inadequate to test the legality of his trial by military commission.  His principal argument is that the exclusive-review provisions are inadequate because they foreclose review of the claims he raises here.  Though petitioner&#x92;s brief does not parse the statutory language, his argument evidently rests on an erroneously narrow reading of DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  That provision grants the D. C. Circuit authority to review, &#x93;to the extent the Constitution and laws of the United States are applicable, whether the use of such standards and procedures to reach the final decision is consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.&#x94;  In the quoted text, the phrase &#x93;such standards and procedures&#x94; refers to &#x93;the standards and procedures specified in the military order referred to in subparagraph (A),&#x94; namely &#x93;Military Commission Order No. 1, dated August 31, 2005 (or any successor military order).&#x94;  DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(i), (e)(3)(A), <em>ibid</em>.  This Military Commission Order (Order No. 1) is the Department of Defense&#x92;s fundamental implementing order for the President&#x92;s order authorizing trials by military commission.  Order No. 1 establishes commissions, &#xA7;2; delineates their jurisdiction, &#xA7;3; provides for their officers, &#xA7;4(A); provides for their prosecution and defense counsel, &#xA7;4(B), (C); lays out all their procedures, both pretrial and trial, &#xA7;5(A)&#x96;(P), &#xA7;6(A)&#x96;(G); and provides for posttrial military review through the Secretary of Defense and the President, &#xA7;6(H).  In short, the &#x93;standards and procedures specified in&#x94; Order No. 1 include <em>every aspect</em> of the military commissions, including the fact of their existence and every respect in which they differ from courts-martial.  Petitioner&#x92;s claims that the President lacks legal authority to try him before a military commission constitute claims that &#x93;the use of such standards and procedures,&#x94; as specified in Order No. 1, is &#x93;[in]consistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States,&#x94; DTA &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(D)(ii), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  The D. C. Circuit thus retains jurisdiction to consider these claims on postdecision review, and the Government does not dispute that the DTA leaves unaffected our certiorari jurisdiction under

Thus, the DTA merely <em>defers</em> our jurisdiction to consider petitioner&#x92;s claims; it does not eliminate that jurisdiction.  It constitutes neither an &#x93;inadequate&#x94; nor an &#x93;ineffective&#x94; substitute for petitioner&#x92;s pending habeas application.<a name="ZD-7ref" href="#ZD-7" class="">

        <p class="bodytext">    Though it does not squarely address the issue, the Court hints ominously that &#x93;the Government&#x92;s preferred reading&#x94; would &#x93;rais[e] grave questions about Congress&#x92; authority to impinge upon this Court&#x92;s appellate jurisdiction, particularly in habeas cases.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 10&#x96;11 (citing <em>Ex parte Yerger</em>, 
8Wall.
85 (1869); <em>Felker</em> v. <em>Turpin</em>,

It is not clear how there could be any such lurking questions, in light of the aptly named &#x93;<em>Exceptions</em> Clause&#x94; of Article III, &#xA7;2, which, in making our appellate jurisdiction subject to &#x93;such Exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress shall make,&#x94; explicitly permits exactly what Congress has done here.  But any doubt our prior cases might have created on this score is surely chimerical in <em>this</em> case.  As just noted, the exclusive-review provisions provide a substitute for habeas review adequate to satisfy the Suspension Clause, which <em>forbids</em> the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus.  <em>A fortiori</em> they provide a substitute adequate to satisfy any implied substantive limitations, whether real or imaginary, upon the Exceptions Clause, which <em>authorizes</em> such exceptions as &#xA7;1005(e)(1).</p>
        <p class="opcentered">III</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if Congress had not clearly and constitutionally eliminated jurisdiction over this case, neither this Court nor the lower courts ought to exercise it.  Traditionally, equitable principles govern both the exercise of habeas jurisdiction and the granting of the injunctive relief sought by petitioner.  See <em>Schlesinger</em> v. <em>Councilman</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/420/738" class="subref" title="subref">420 U. S. 738</a>,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">311</a> (1982)
.  In light of Congress&#x92;s provision of an alternate avenue for petitioner&#x92;s claims in &#xA7;1005(e)(3), those equitable principles counsel that we abstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In requesting abstention, the Government relies principally on <em>Councilman</em>, in which we abstained from considering a serviceman&#x92;s claim that his charge for marijuana possession was not sufficiently &#x93;service-connected&#x94; to trigger the subject-matter jurisdiction of the military courts-martial.  See 420 U. S., at 740, 758.  Admittedly, <em>Councilman</em> does not squarely control petitioner&#x92;s case, but it provides the closest analogue in our jurisprudence.  As the Court describes, <em>ante</em>, at 21, <em>Councilman</em> &#x93;identifie[d] two considerations of comity that together favor[ed] abstention pending completion of ongoing court-martial proceedings against service personnel.&#x94;  But the Court errs in finding these considerations inapplicable to this case.  Both of them, and a third consideration not emphasized in <em>Councilman</em>, all cut in favor of abstention here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    First, the Court observes that <em>Councilman</em> rested in part on the fact that &#x93;military discipline and, therefore, the efficient operation of the Armed Forces are best served if the military justice system acts without regular interference from civilian courts,&#x94; and concludes that &#x93;Hamdan is not a member of our Nation&#x92;s Armed Forces, so concerns about military discipline do not apply.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  This is true enough.  But for some reason, the Court fails to make any inquiry into whether military commission trials might involve <em>other</em> &#x93;military necessities&#x94; or &#x93;unique military exigencies,&#x94; 420 U. S., at 757, comparable in gravity to those at stake in <em>Councilman</em>.  To put this in context: The charge against the respondent in <em>Councilman</em> was the off-base possession and sale of marijuana while he was stationed in Fort Sill, Oklahoma, see <em>id.,</em> at 739&#x96;740.  The charge against the petitioner here is joining and actively abetting the murderous conspiracy that slaughtered thousands of innocent American civilians without warning on September 11, 2001.  While <em>Councilman</em> held that the prosecution of the former charge involved &#x93;military necessities&#x94; counseling against our interference, the Court <em>does not even ponder the same question</em> for the latter charge.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The reason for the Court&#x92;s &#x93;blinkered study&#x94; of this question, <em>ante</em>, at 19, is not hard to fathom.  The principal opinion on the merits makes clear that it does not believe that the trials by military commission involve any &#x93;military necessity&#x94; <em>at all:</em> &#x93;The charge&#x92;s shortcomings &#x2026; are indicative of a broader inability on the Executive&#x92;s part here to satisfy the most basic precondition &#x2026; for establishment of military commissions: military necessity.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 48.  This is quite at odds with the views on this subject expressed by our political branches.  Because of &#x93;military necessity,&#x94; a joint session of Congress authorized the President to &#x93;use all necessary and appropriate force,&#x94; including military commissions, &#x93;against those nations, organizations, or persons [such as petitioner] he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001.&#x94;  Authorization for Use of Military Force, &#xA7;2(a), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">115</a>Stat.
224, note following 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/50/1541.html" class="subref" title="subref">50 U. S. C. &#xA7;1541</a> (2000 ed., Supp. III).  In keeping with this authority, the President has determined that &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks, it is necessary for individuals subject to this order &#x2026; to be detained, and, when tried, to be tried for violations of the laws of war and other applicable laws by military tribunals.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 2001, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e) (2002).  It is not clear where the Court derives the authority&#x97;or the audacity&#x97;to contradict this determination.  If &#x93;military necessities&#x94; relating to &#x93;duty&#x94; and &#x93;discipline&#x94; required abstention in <em>Councilman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 757, military necessities relating to the disabling, deterrence, and punishment of the mass-murdering terrorists of September 11 require abstention all the more here.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    The Court further seeks to distinguish <em>Councilman</em> on the ground that &#x93;the tribunal convened to try Hamdan is not part of the integrated system of military courts, complete with independent review panels, that Congress has established.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  To be sure, <em>Councilman</em> emphasized that &#x93;Congress created an integrated system of military courts and review procedures, a critical element of which is the Court of Military Appeals consisting of civilian judges completely removed from all military influence or persuasion, who would gain over time thorough familiarity with military problems.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 758 (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted).  The Court contrasts this &#x93;integrated system&#x94; insulated from military influence with the review scheme established by Order No. 1, which &#x93;provides that appeal of a review panel&#x92;s decision may be had only to the Secretary of Defense himself, &#xA7;6(H)(5), and then, finally, to the President, &#xA7;6(H)(6).&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 23.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Even if we were to accept the Court&#x92;s extraordinary assumption that the President &#x93;lack[s] the structural insulation from military influence that characterizes the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces,&#x94; <em>ante</em>, at 23,<a name="ZD-8ref" href="#ZD-8" class="">

            </a> the Court&#x92;s description of the review scheme here is anachronistic.  As of December 30, 2005, the &#x93;fina[l]&#x94; review of decisions by military commissions is now conducted by the D. C. Circuit pursuant to &#xA7;1005(e)(3) of the DTA, and by this Court under

This provision for review by Article III courts creates, if anything, a review scheme <em>more</em> insulated from Executive control than that in <em>Councilman</em>.<a name="ZD-9ref" href="#ZD-9" class="">

                    <b>9</b>
                </sup>
            </a>  At the time we decided <em>Councilman</em>, Congress had not &#x93;conferred on any Art[icle] III court jurisdiction directly to review court-martial determinations.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 746.  The final arbiter of direct appeals was the Court of Military Appeals (now the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces), an Article I court whose members possessed neither life tenure, nor salary protection, nor the constitutional protection from removal provided to federal judges in Article III, &#xA7;1.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/10/867.html#a_2" class="subref" title="subref">10 U. S. C. &#xA7;867(a)(2)</a> (1970 ed.).</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    Moreover, a third consideration counsels strongly in favor of abstention in this case.  <em>Councilman</em> reasoned that the &#x93;considerations of comity, the necessity of respect for coordinate judicial systems&#x94; that motivated our decision in <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/37" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 37</a> (1971)
, were inapplicable to courts-martial, because &#x93;the particular demands of federalism are not implicated.&#x94;  420 U. S., at 756, 757.  Though military commissions likewise do not implicate &#x93;the particular demands of federalism,&#x94; considerations of <em>interbranch</em> comity at the federal level weigh heavily against our exercise of equity jurisdiction in this case.  Here, apparently for the first time in history, see Motion to Dismiss 6, a District Court enjoined ongoing military commission proceedings, which had been deemed &#x93;necessary&#x94; by the President &#x93;[t]o protect the United States and its citizens, and for the effective conduct of military operations and prevention of terrorist attacks.&#x94;  Military Order of Nov. 13, 3 CFR &#xA7;918(e).  Such an order brings the Judicial Branch into direct conflict with the Executive in an area where the Executive&#x92;s competence is maximal and ours is virtually nonexistent.  We should exercise our equitable discretion to <em>avoid</em> such conflict.  Instead, the Court rushes headlong to meet it.  Elsewhere, we have deferred exercising habeas jurisdiction until state courts have &#x93;the first opportunity to review&#x94; a petitioner&#x92;s claim, merely to &#x93;reduc[e] friction between the state and federal court systems.&#x94;  <em>O&#x92;Sullivan</em> v. <em>Boerckel</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/526/838" class="subref" title="subref">526 U. S. 838</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">844</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">845</a> (1999)
.  The &#x93;friction&#x94; created today between this Court and the Executive Branch is many times more serious.</p>
        <p class="bodytext">    In the face of such concerns, the Court relies heavily on <em>Ex parte Quirin,</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/317/1" class="subref" title="subref">317 U. S. 1</a> (1942)
: &#x93;Far from abstaining pending the conclusion of military proceedings, which were ongoing, [in <em>Quirin</em>] we convened a special Term to hear the case and expedited our review.&#x94;  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  It is likely that the Government in <em>Quirin</em>, unlike here, preferred a hasty resolution of the case in this Court, so that it could swiftly execute the sentences imposed, see <em>Hamdi</em> v. <em>Rumsfeld</em>, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/507" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 507</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">569</a> (2004)
 (<span class="smallcaps">Scalia, J</span>., dissenting).  But the Court&#x92;s reliance on <em>Quirin</em> suffers from a more fundamental defect: Once again, it ignores the DTA, which creates an avenue for the consideration of petitioner&#x92;s claims that did not exist at the time of <em>Quirin</em>.  Collateral application for habeas review was the <em>only</em> vehicle available.  And there was no compelling reason to postpone consideration of the <em>Quirin</em> application until the termination of military proceedings, because the only cognizable claims presented were general challenges to the authority of the commissions that would not be affected by the specific proceedings.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8&#x96;9, n. 2.  In the DTA, by contrast, Congress has expanded the scope of Article III review and has channeled it exclusively through a single, postverdict appeal to Article III courts.  Because Congress has created a novel unitary scheme of Article III review of military commissions that was absent in 1942, <em>Quirin</em> is no longer governing precedent.</p>

But this quote merely restates the obvious: An effective-date provision does not render a statute applicable to &#x93;conduct that occurred at an earlier date,&#x94; but of course it renders the statute applicable to conduct that occurs on the effective date and all future dates&#x97;such as the Court&#x92;s exercise of jurisdiction here.

See Memorandum from Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz re: Order Establishing Com-batant Status Review Tribunals, at 3 &#xA7;h (July 7, 2004), avail-able at http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jul2004/d20040707review.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 27, 2006, and availablein Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file).  Subsection (e)(3) authorizes the D. C. Circuit to review &#x93;the validity of any final decision rendered pursuant to Military Commission Order No. 1,&#x94; &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(A), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743. Historically, federal courts have never reviewed the validity of the final decision of any military commission; their jurisdiction has been restricted to considering the commission&#x92;s &#x93;lawful authority to hear, decide and condemn,&#x94;  In re Yamashita, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/327/1" class="subref" title="subref">327 U. S. 1</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">8</a> (1946)
 (emphasis added).  See also Johnson v. Eisentrager,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">786</a>&#x96;787 (1950)
.  Thus, contrary to the Court&#x92;s suggestion, ante, at 17, subsections (e)(2) and (e)(3) confer new jurisdiction: They impose judicial oversight on a traditionally unreviewable exercise of military authority by the Commander in Chief.  They arguably &#x93;spea[k] not just to the power of a particular court but to . . . substantive rights . . . as well,&#x94; Hughes Aircraft Co. v. United States ex rel. Shumer,

&#x97;namely, the unreviewable powers of the President.  Our recent cases had reiterated that the Executive is protected by the presumption against retroactivity in such comparatively trivial contexts as suits for tax refunds and increased pay, see Landgraf  v. USI Film Products,

In reviewing the constitutionality of legislation, we generally presume that the Executive will implement its provisions in good faith.

            <a class="fnflag" name="ZD-9" href="#ZD-9ref">9</a> In rejecting our analysis, the Court observes that appeals to the D. C. Circuit under subsection (e)(3) are discretionary, rather than as of right, when the military commission imposes a sentence less than 10 years&#x92; imprisonment, see ante, at 23, n. 19, 52&#x96;53; &#xA7;1005(e)(3)(B), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>Stat.
2743.  The relevance of this observation to the abstention question is unfathomable.  The fact that Article III review is discretionary does not mean that it lacks &#x93;structural insulation from military influence,&#x94; ante, at 23, and its discretionary nature presents no obstacle to the courts&#x92; future review these cases.


The Court might more cogently have relied on the discretionary nature of review to argue that the statute provides an inadequate substitute for habeas review under the Suspension Clause.  See supra, at 16&#x96;18.  But this argument would have no force, even if all appeals to the D. C. Circuit were discretionary.  The exercise of habeas jurisdiction has traditionally been entirely a matter of the court&#x92;s equitable discretion, see Withrow v. Williams, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/507/680" class="subref" title="subref">507 U. S. 680</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">715</a>&#x96;718 (1993)
 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), so the fact that habeas jurisdiction is replaced by discretionary appellate review does not render the substitution &#x93;inadequate.&#x94;  Swain, 430 U. S., at 381.
