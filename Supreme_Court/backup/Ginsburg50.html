				A motion by a federal prisoner for postconviction relief under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2255.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;2255</a> is subject to a one-year time limitation that generally runs from &#x93;the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.&#x94;  &#xA7;2255, &#xB6;6(1).  This case concerns the starting date for the one-year limitation.  It presents a narrow but recurring question on which courts of appeals have divided: When a defendant in a federal prosecution takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment of conviction, but does not next petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court, does the judgment become &#x93;final&#x94; for postconviction relief purposes (1) when the appellate court issues its mandate affirming the conviction, or, instead, (2) on the date, ordinarily 69 days later, when the time for filing a petition for certiorari expires?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In accord with this Court&#x92;s consistent understanding of finality in the context of collateral review, and the weight of lower court authority, we reject the issuance of the appellate court mandate as the triggering date.  For the purpose of starting the clock on &#xA7;2255&#x92;s one-year limitation period, we hold, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court&#x92;s affirmation of the conviction.

				In 1997, petitioner Erick Cornell Clay was convicted of arson and distribution of cocaine base in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.  On November 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions.  That court&#x92;s mandate issued on December 15, 1998.  See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 40(a)(1) and 41(b) (when no petition for rehearing is filed, a court of appeals&#x92; mandate issues 21 days after entry of judgment).  Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari.  The time in which he could have petitioned for certiorari expired on February 22, 1999, 90 days after entry of the Court of Appeals&#x92; judgment, see this Court&#x92;s Rule 13(1), and 69 days after the issuance of the appellate court&#x92;s mandate.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				On February 22, 2000&#x97;one year and 69 days after the Court of Appeals issued its mandate and exactly one year after the time for seeking certiorari expired&#x97;Clay filed a motion in the District Court, pursuant to 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2255.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;2255</a>, to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence.  Congress has prescribed &#x93;[a] 1-year period of limitation&#x94; for such motions &#x93;run[ning] from the latest of&#x94; four specified dates.  &#xA7;2255, &#xB6;6.  Of the four dates, the only one relevant in this case, as in the generality of cases, is the first: &#x93;the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.&#x94;  &#xA7;2255, &#xB6;6(1).

				, 154 F. 3d 672, 674 (CA7 1998)

Six Courts of Appeals have parted ways with the Seventh and Fourth Circuits.

				Finality is variously defined; like many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on context.  Typically, a federal judgment becomes final for appellate review and claim preclusion purposes when the district court disassociates itself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court of first instance save execution of the judgment.  See, 
				<em>

				</em>
				 (1980).  For other purposes, finality attaches at a different stage.  For example, for certain determinations under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3161.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. &#xA7;3161</a>

				and under a now-repealed version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, several lower courts have held that finality attends issuance of the appellate court&#x92;s mandate.  See Brief for 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 by Invitation of the Court 22&#x96;28 (hereinafter DeBruin Brief) (citing cases).  For the purpose of seeking review by this Court, in contrast, &#x93;[t]he time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).&#x94;  This Court&#x92;s Rule 13(3).

				Here, the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning: Finality attaches when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.

				We hold that, for federal criminal defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with this Court on direct review, &#xA7;2255&#x92;s one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking such review expires.  Under this rule, Clay&#x92;s &#xA7;2255 petition was timely filed.

						 Although recognizing that &#x93;the question is not presented in this case,&#x94; Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, amicus suggests that &#xA7;2255&#x92;s limitation period starts to run upon issuance of the court of appeals&#x92; mandate even in cases in which the defendant does petition for certiorari.  Id., at 27&#x96;28, 36&#x96;38, 41&#x96;42.  As amicus also recognizes, however, id., at 41, courts of appeals &#x93;have uniformly concluded that, if a prisoner petitions for certiorari, the contested conviction becomes final when the Supreme Court either denies the writ or issues a decision on the merits,&#x94; United States v. Hicks, 283 F. 3d 380, 387 (CADC 2002).

				A motion by a federal prisoner for postconviction relief under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2255.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;2255</a> is subject to a one-year time limitation that generally runs from &#x93;the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.&#x94;  &#xA7;2255, &#xB6;6(1).  This case concerns the starting date for the one-year limitation.  It presents a narrow but recurring question on which courts of appeals have divided: When a defendant in a federal prosecution takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment of conviction, but does not next petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court, does the judgment become &#x93;final&#x94; for postconviction relief purposes (1) when the appellate court issues its mandate affirming the conviction, or, instead, (2) on the date, ordinarily 69 days later, when the time for filing a petition for certiorari expires?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In accord with this Court&#x92;s consistent understanding of finality in the context of collateral review, and the weight of lower court authority, we reject the issuance of the appellate court mandate as the triggering date.  For the purpose of starting the clock on &#xA7;2255&#x92;s one-year limitation period, we hold, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court&#x92;s affirmation of the conviction.

				In 1997, petitioner Erick Cornell Clay was convicted of arson and distribution of cocaine base in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.  On November 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions.  That court&#x92;s mandate issued on December 15, 1998.  See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 40(a)(1) and 41(b) (when no petition for rehearing is filed, a court of appeals&#x92; mandate issues 21 days after entry of judgment).  Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari.  The time in which he could have petitioned for certiorari expired on February 22, 1999, 90 days after entry of the Court of Appeals&#x92; judgment, see this Court&#x92;s Rule 13(1), and 69 days after the issuance of the appellate court&#x92;s mandate.

				Finality is variously defined; like many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on context.  Typically, a federal judgment becomes final for appellate review and claim preclusion purposes when the district court disassociates itself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court of first instance save execution of the judgment.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Quackenbush
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Allstate Ins. Co.,

; Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#xA7;13, Comment 
				<em>
					b
				</em>
				 (1980).  For other purposes, finality attaches at a different stage.  For example, for certain determinations under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3161.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. &#xA7;3161</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				and under a now-repealed version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, several lower courts have held that finality attends issuance of the appellate court&#x92;s mandate.  See Brief for 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 by Invitation of the Court 22&#x96;28 (hereinafter DeBruin Brief) (citing cases).  For the purpose of seeking review by this Court, in contrast, &#x93;[t]he time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).&#x94;  This Court&#x92;s Rule 13(3).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Here, the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning: Finality attaches when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.

				&#x92; reliance on &#xA7;2263 encounters essentially the same problem as does his reliance on &#xA7;2244(d)(1)(A): Section 2255, &#xB6;6(1), refers to 
				<em>
					neither
				</em>
				 of the two events that &#xA7;2263(a) identifies as possible starting points for the limitation period&#x97;&#x93;affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review&#x94; and &#x93;the expiration of the time for seeking such review.&#x94;  Thus, reasoning by negative implication from &#xA7;2263 does not justify the conclusion that &#xA7;2255, &#xB6;6(1)&#x92;s limitation period begins to run at one of those times rather than the other.  Cf. 
				<em>

				, at 6&#x96;8.  Second, &#xA7;2263(a) ties the applicable limitation period to &#x93;affirmance of the conviction and sentence,&#x94; while &#xA7;2255, &#xB6;6(1), ties the limitation period to the date when &#x93;the judgment of conviction becomes final.&#x94;  See

				We hold that, for federal criminal defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with this Court on direct review, &#xA7;2255&#x92;s one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking such review expires.  Under this rule, Clay&#x92;s &#xA7;2255 petition was timely filed.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

						 Agreeing with the position advanced by the majority of the courts of appeals that have ruled on the question, the United States joins petitioner Clay in urging that Clay&#x92;s &#xA7;2255 motion was timely filed.  We therefore invited David W. DeBruin to brief and argue this case, as amicus curiae, in support of the Seventh Circuit&#x92;s judgment.  Mr. DeBruin&#x92;s able advocacy permits us to decide the case satisfied that the relevant issues have been fully aired.

						 Although recognizing that &#x93;the question is not presented in this case,&#x94; Tr. of Oral Arg. 27, amicus suggests that &#xA7;2255&#x92;s limitation period starts to run upon issuance of the court of appeals&#x92; mandate even in cases in which the defendant does petition for certiorari.

				A motion by a federal prisoner for postconviction relief under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2255.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;2255</a> is subject to a one-year time limitation that generally runs from &#x93;the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.&#x94;  &#xA7;2255, &#xB6;6(1).  This case concerns the starting date for the one-year limitation.  It presents a narrow but recurring question on which courts of appeals have divided: When a defendant in a federal prosecution takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment of conviction, but does not next petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court, does the judgment become &#x93;final&#x94; for postconviction relief purposes (1) when the appellate court issues its mandate affirming the conviction, or, instead, (2) on the date, ordinarily 69 days later, when the time for filing a petition for certiorari expires?
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In accord with this Court&#x92;s consistent understanding of finality in the context of collateral review, and the weight of lower court authority, we reject the issuance of the appellate court mandate as the triggering date.  For the purpose of starting the clock on &#xA7;2255&#x92;s one-year limitation period, we hold, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court&#x92;s affirmation of the conviction.

				In 1997, petitioner Erick Cornell Clay was convicted of arson and distribution of cocaine base in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.  On November 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions.  That court&#x92;s mandate issued on December 15, 1998.  See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 40(a)(1) and 41(b) (when no petition for rehearing is filed, a court of appeals&#x92; mandate issues 21 days after entry of judgment).  Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari.  The time in which he could have petitioned for certiorari expired on February 22, 1999, 90 days after entry of the Court of Appeals&#x92; judgment, see this Court&#x92;s Rule 13(1), and 69 days after the issuance of the appellate court&#x92;s mandate.

				Finality is variously defined; like many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on context.  Typically, a federal judgment becomes final for appellate review and claim preclusion purposes when the district court disassociates itself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court of first instance save execution of the judgment.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					Quackenbush
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Allstate Ins. Co.,
				</em>

; Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#xA7;13, Comment 
				<em>
					b
				</em>
				 (1980).  For other purposes, finality attaches at a different stage.  For example, for certain determinations under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3161.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. &#xA7;3161</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				and under a now-repealed version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, several lower courts have held that finality attends issuance of the appellate court&#x92;s mandate.  See Brief for 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 by Invitation of the Court 22&#x96;28 (hereinafter DeBruin Brief) (citing cases).  For the purpose of seeking review by this Court, in contrast, &#x93;[t]he time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).&#x94;  This Court&#x92;s Rule 13(3).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Here, the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning: Finality attaches when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.

At that point, we referred to the maxim invoked by

The comparison of the two subsections, we said, &#x93;fortified&#x94; the broad construction we approved for the unmodified words &#x93;any interest &#x2026; acquired.&#x94;

Cf.

				We hold that, for federal criminal defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with this Court on direct review, &#xA7;2255&#x92;s one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking such review expires.  Under this rule, Clay&#x92;s &#xA7;2255 petition was timely filed.

				A motion by a federal prisoner for postconviction relief under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2255.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S. C. &#xA7;2255</a> is subject to a one-year time limitation that generally runs from &#x93;the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final.&#x94;  &#xA7;2255, &#xB6;6(1).  This case concerns the starting date for the one-year limitation.  It presents a narrow but recurring question on which courts of appeals have divided: When a defendant in a federal prosecution takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment of conviction, but does not next petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court, does the judgment become &#x93;final&#x94; for postconviction relief purposes (1) when the appellate court issues its mandate affirming the conviction, or, instead, (2) on the date, ordinarily 69 days later, when the time for filing a petition for certiorari expires?

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In accord with this Court&#x92;s consistent understanding of finality in the context of collateral review, and the weight of lower court authority, we reject the issuance of the appellate court mandate as the triggering date.  For the purpose of starting the clock on &#xA7;2255&#x92;s one-year limitation period, we hold, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court&#x92;s affirmation of the conviction.

				In 1997, petitioner Erick Cornell Clay was convicted of arson and distribution of cocaine base in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.  On November 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions.  That court&#x92;s mandate issued on December 15, 1998.  See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 40(a)(1) and 41(b) (when no petition for rehearing is filed, a court of appeals&#x92; mandate issues 21 days after entry of judgment).  Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari.  The time in which he could have petitioned for certiorari expired on February 22, 1999, 90 days after entry of the Court of Appeals&#x92; judgment, see this Court&#x92;s Rule 13(1), and 69 days after the issuance of the appellate court&#x92;s mandate.

				Finality is variously defined; like many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on context.  Typically, a federal judgment becomes final for appellate review and claim preclusion purposes when the district court disassociates itself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court of first instance save execution of the judgment.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>

					Quackenbush
				</em>

; Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#xA7;13, Comment 
				<em>
					b
				</em>
				 (1980).  For other purposes, finality attaches at a different stage.  For example, for certain determinations under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3161.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. &#xA7;3161</a>
            <em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				and under a now-repealed version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, several lower courts have held that finality attends issuance of the appellate court&#x92;s mandate.  See Brief for 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 by Invitation of the Court 22&#x96;28 (hereinafter DeBruin Brief) (citing cases).  For the purpose of seeking review by this Court, in contrast, &#x93;[t]he time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).&#x94;  This Court&#x92;s Rule 13(3).

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				Here, the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning: Finality attaches when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.

				We hold that, for federal criminal defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with this Court on direct review, &#xA7;2255&#x92;s one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking such review expires.  Under this rule, Clay&#x92;s &#xA7;2255 petition was timely filed.

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/28/2255.html" class="subref" title="subref">28 U. S.

This case concerns the starting date for the one-year limitation.  It presents a narrow but recurring question on which courts of appeals have divided: When a defendant in a federal prosecution takes an unsuccessful direct appeal from a judgment of conviction, but does not next petition for a writ of certiorari from this Court, does the judgment become &#x93;final&#x94; for postconviction relief purposes (1) when the appellate court issues its mandate affirming the conviction, or, instead, (2) on the date, ordinarily 69 days later, when the time for filing a petition for certiorari expires?

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In accord with this Court&#x92;s consistent understanding of finality in the context of collateral review, and the weight of lower court authority, we reject the issuance of the appellate court mandate as the triggering date.  For the purpose of starting the clock on &#xA7;2255&#x92;s one-year limitation period, we hold, a judgment of conviction becomes final when the time expires for filing a petition for certiorari contesting the appellate court&#x92;s affirmation of the conviction.

				In 1997, petitioner Erick Cornell Clay was convicted of arson and distribution of cocaine base in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana.  On November 23, 1998, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed his convictions.  That court&#x92;s mandate issued on December 15, 1998.  See Fed. Rules App. Proc. 40(a)(1) and 41(b) (when no petition for rehearing is filed, a court of appeals&#x92; mandate issues 21 days after entry of judgment).  Clay did not file a petition for a writ of certiorari.  The time in which he could have petitioned for certiorari expired on February 22, 1999, 90 days after entry of the Court of Appeals&#x92; judgment, see this Court&#x92;s Rule 13(1), and 69 days after the issuance of the appellate court&#x92;s mandate.

				Finality is variously defined; like many legal terms, its precise meaning depends on context.  Typically, a federal judgment becomes final for appellate review and claim preclusion purposes when the district court disassociates itself from the case, leaving nothing to be done at the court of first instance save execution of the judgment.  See,

				</em>
				 (1980).  For other purposes, finality attaches at a different stage.  For example, for certain determinations under the Speedy Trial Act of 1974, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/3161.html" class="subref" title="subref">18 U. S. C. &#xA7;3161</a>

				</em>
				,
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				and under a now-repealed version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33, several lower courts have held that finality attends issuance of the appellate court&#x92;s mandate.  See Brief for 
				<em>
					Amicus Curiae
				</em>
				 by Invitation of the Court 22&#x96;28 (hereinafter DeBruin Brief) (citing cases).  For the purpose of seeking review by this Court, in contrast, &#x93;[t]he time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).&#x94;  This Court&#x92;s Rule 13(3).

				Here, the relevant context is postconviction relief, a context in which finality has a long-recognized, clear meaning: Finality attaches when this Court affirms a conviction on the merits on direct review or denies a petition for a writ of certiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari petition expires.

Section 2244(d)(1) governs petitions by state prisoners.

Section 2263(a) prescribes a 180-day limitation period for such petitions running from &#x93;final State court affirmance of the conviction and sentence on direct review or the expiration of the time for seeking such review.&#x94;  That period is tolled, however, &#x93;from the date that a petition for certiorari is filed in the Supreme Court until the date of final disposition of the petition if a State prisoner files the petition to secure review by the Supreme Court of the affirmance of a capital sentence on direct review by the court of last resort of the State or other final State court decision on direct review.&#x94;  &#xA7;2263(b)(1).

				We hold that, for federal criminal defendants who do not file a petition for certiorari with this Court on direct review, &#xA7;2255&#x92;s one-year limitation period starts to run when the time for seeking such review expires.  Under this rule, Clay&#x92;s &#xA7;2255 petition was timely filed.
