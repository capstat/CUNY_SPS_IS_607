        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In response to petitioners&#x92; complaints, respondent prison officials have mounted a facial challenge to the institutionalized-persons provision of RLUIPA; respondents contend, 
				<em>
					inter alia
				</em>
				, that the Act improperly advances religion in violation of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>&#x92;s Establishment Clause.  The District Court denied respondents&#x92; motion to dismiss petitioners&#x92; complaints, but the Court of Appeals reversed that determination.  The appeals court held, as the prison officials urged, that the portion of RLUIPA applicable to institutionalized persons,

				&#x93;For more than a decade, the federal Bureau of Prisons has managed the largest correctional system in the Nation under the same heightened scrutiny standard as RLUIPA without compromising prison security, public safety, or the constitutional rights of other prisoners.&#x94;  Brief for United States 24 (citation omitted).  The Congress that enacted RLUIPA was aware of the Bureau&#x92;s experience.  See Joint Statement S7776 (letter from Department of Justice to Senator Hatch) (&#x93;[W]e do not believe [RLUIPA] would have an unreasonable impact on prison operations.  RFRA has been in effect in the Federal prison system for six years and compliance with that statute has not been an unreasonable burden to the Federal prison system.&#x94;).  We see no reason to anticipate that abusive prisoner litigation will overburden the operations of state and local institutions.  The procedures mandated by the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we note, are designed to inhibit frivolous filings.

Flores, before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 3, p. 11, n. 1 (1998) (hereinafter Protecting Religious Freedom) (prepared statement of Marc D.

Id., at 39 (statement of Isaac M. Jaroslawicz, Director of Legal Affairs for the Aleph Institute).

						 Respondents argued below that RLUIPA exceeds Congress&#x92; legislative powers under the Spending and Commerce Clauses and violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentx" class="subref" title="subref">Tenth Amendment</a>.  The District Court rejected respondents&#x92; challenges under the Spending Clause, Gerhardt v. Lazaroff, 221 F. Supp. 2d 827, 839&#x96;849 (SD Ohio 2002), and the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentx" class="subref" title="subref">Tenth Amendment</a>, id., at 850&#x96;851, and declined to reach the Commerce Clause ques-tion, id., at 838&#x96;839.  The Sixth Circuit, having determined that RLUIPA violates the Establishment Clause, did not rule on respondents&#x92; further arguments.  See 349 F. 3d 257, 259&#x96;260, 269 (2003).  Respondents renew those arguments in this Court.  They also augment their federalism-based or residual-powers contentions by asserting that, in the space between the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses, the States&#x92; choices are not subject to congressional oversight.  See Brief for Respondents 9, 25&#x96;33; cf. Madison v. Riter, 355 F. 3d 310, 322 (CA4 2003).  Because these defensive pleas were not addressed by the Court of Appeals, and mindful that we are a court of review, not of first view, we do not consider them here.  See F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v.

						 Directed at obstructions institutional arrangements place on religious observances, RLUIPA does not require a State to pay for an inmate&#x92;s devotional accessories.  See, e.g., Charles v.

						 Respondents argue, in line with the Sixth Circuit, that RLUIPA goes beyond permissible reduction of impediments to free exercise.  The Act, they project, advances religion by encouraging prisoners to &#x93;get religion,&#x94; and thereby gain accommodations afforded under RLUIPA.  Brief for Respondents 15&#x96;17; see 349 F. 3d, at 266 (&#x93;One effect of RLUIPA is to induce prisoners to adopt or feign religious belief in order to receive the statute&#x92;s benefits.&#x94;).  While some accommodations of religious observance, notably the opportunity to assemble in worship services, might attract joiners seeking a break in their closely guarded day, we doubt that all accommodations would be perceived as &#x93;benefits.&#x94;  For example, congressional hearings on RLUIPA revealed that one state corrections system served as its kosher diet &#x93;a fruit, a vegetable, a granola bar, and a liquid nutritional supplement&#x97;each and every meal.&#x94;  Protecting Religious Freedom, pt. 3, at 38 (statement of Jaroslawicz).


The argument, in any event, founders on the fact that Ohio already facilitates religious services for mainstream faiths.  The State provides chaplains, allows inmates to possess religious items, and permits assembly for worship.  See App. 199 (affidavit of David Schwarz, Religious Services Administrator for the South Region of the Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation and Correction (Oct. 19, 2000)) (job duties include &#x93;facilitating the delivery of religious services in 14 correctional institutions of various security levels throughout &#x2026; Ohio&#x94;); Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation and Correction, Table of Organization, available at http://www.drc.state.oh.us/web/DRCORG1.pdf (department includes &#x93;Religious Services&#x94; division) (as visited May 27, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file); Brief for United States 20, and n. 8 (citing, inter alia, Gawloski v. Dallman, 803 F. Supp. 103, 113 (SD Ohio 1992) (inmate in protective custody allowed to attend a congregational religious service, possess a Bible and other religious materials, and receive chaplain visits); Taylor v. Perini, 413 F. Supp. 189, 238 (ND Ohio 1976) (institutional chaplains had free access to correctional area)).

						 The Sixth Circuit posited that an irreligious prisoner and member of the Aryan Nation who challenges prison officials&#x92; confiscation of his white supremacist literature as a violation of his free association and expression rights would have his claims evaluated under the deferential rational-relationship standard described in Turner v. Safley, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/482/78" class="subref" title="subref">482 U. S. 78</a> (1987)
.  A member of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian challenging a similar withholding, the Sixth Circuit assumed, would have a stronger prospect of success because a court would review his claim under RLUIPA&#x92;s compelling-interest standard.  349 F. 3d, at 266 (citing Madison v. Riter, 240 F. Supp. 2d 566, 576 (WD Va. 2003)).  Courts, however, may be expected to recognize the government&#x92;s countervailing compelling interest in not facilitating inflammatory racist activity that could imperil prison security and order.  Cf. Reimann v. Murphy, 897 F. Supp. 398, 402&#x96;403 (ED Wis. 1995) (concluding, under RFRA, that excluding racist literature advocating violence was the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling state interest in preventing prison violence); George v. Sullivan, 896 F. Supp. 895, 898 (WD Wis. 1995) (same).

						 Respondents argue that prison gangs use religious activity to cloak their illicit and often violent conduct.  The instant case was considered below on a motion to dismiss.  Thus, the parties&#x92; conflicting assertions on this matter are not before us.  It bears repetition, however, that prison security is a compelling state interest, and that deference is due to institutional officials&#x92; expertise in this area.  See supra, at 12&#x96;13.  Further, prison officials may appropriately question whether a prisoner&#x92;s religiosity, asserted as the basis for a requested accommodation, is authentic.  Although RLUIPA bars inquiry into whether a particular belief or practice is &#x93;central&#x94; to a prisoner&#x92;s religion, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-5.html#7_A" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;5(7)(A)</a>, the Act does not preclude inquiry into the sincerity of a prisoner&#x92;s professed religiosity.  Cf. Gillette v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/437" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 437</a>,

 (&#x93; &#x91;[T]he &#x93;truth&#x94; of a belief is not open to question&#x92;; rather, the question is whether the objector&#x92;s beliefs are &#x91;truly held.&#x92; &#x94; (quoting United States v. Seeger,

				RLUIPA is the latest of long-running congressional efforts to accord religious exercise heightened protection from government-imposed burdens, consistent with this Court&#x92;s precedents.  Ten years before RLUIPA&#x92;s enactment, the Court held, in

 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmenti" class="subref" title="subref">First Amendment</a>&#x92;s Free Exercise Clause does not inhibit enforcement of otherwise valid laws of general application that incidentally burden religious conduct.  In particular, we ruled that the Free Exercise Clause did not bar Oregon from enforcing its blanket ban on peyote possession with no allowance for sacramental use of the drug.  Accordingly, the State could deny unemployment benefits to persons dismissed from their jobs because of their religiously inspired peyote use.

				The Religion Clauses of the

The second, the Free Exercise Clause, requires government respect for, and noninterference with, the religious beliefs and practices of our Nation&#x92;s people.  While the two Clauses express complementary values, they often exert conflicting pressures.  See

				Finally, RLUIPA does not differentiate among bona fide faiths.  In 
				<em>

				 we invalidated a state law that carved out a separate school district to serve exclusively a community of highly religious Jews, the Satmar Hasidim.

				&#x93;For more than a decade, the federal Bureau of Prisons has managed the largest correctional system in the Nation under the same heightened scrutiny standard as RLUIPA without compromising prison security, public safety, or the constitutional rights of other prisoners.&#x94;  Brief for United States 24 (citation omitted).  The Congress that enacted RLUIPA was aware of the Bureau&#x92;s experience.  See Joint Statement S7776 (letter from Department of Justice to Senator Hatch) (&#x93;[W]e do not believe [RLUIPA] would have an unreasonable impact on prison operations.  RFRA has been in effect in the Federal prison system for six years and compliance with that statute has not been an unreasonable burden to the Federal prison system.&#x94;).  We see no reason to anticipate that abusive prisoner litigation will overburden the operations of state and local institutions.  The procedures mandated by the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we note, are designed to inhibit frivolous filings.

No party has suggested that this case has become moot, nor has it: Without doubt, a live controversy remains among the still-incarcerated petitioners, the United States, and respondents.

						 The hearings held by Congress revealed, for a typical example, that &#x93;[a] state prison in Ohio refused to provide Moslems with Hallal food, even though it provided Kosher food.&#x94;  Hearing on Protecting Religious Freedom After Boerne v. Flores, before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 3, p. 11, n. 1 (1998) (hereinafter Protecting Religious Freedom) (prepared statement of Marc D. Stern, Legal Director, American Jewish Congress).  Across the country, Jewish inmates complained that prison officials refused to provide sack lunches, which would enable inmates to break their fasts after nightfall.  Id., at 39 (statement of Isaac M. Jaroslawicz, Director of Legal Affairs for the Aleph Institute).  The &#x93;Michigan Department of Corrections &#x2026; prohibit[ed] the lighting of Chanukah candles at all state prisons&#x94; even though &#x93;smoking&#x94; and &#x93;votive candles&#x94; were permitted.  Id., at 41 (same).  A priest responsible for communications between Roman Catholic dioceses and corrections facilities in Oklahoma stated that there &#x93;was [a] nearly yearly battle over the Catholic use of Sacramental Wine &#x2026; for the celebration of the Mass,&#x94; and that prisoners&#x92; religious possessions, &#x93;such as the Bible, the Koran, the Talmud or items needed by Native Americans[,] &#x2026; were frequently treated with contempt and were confiscated, damaged or discarded&#x94; by prison officials.

						 Respondents argued below that RLUIPA exceeds Congress&#x92; legislative powers under the Spending and Commerce Clauses and violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentx" class="subref" title="subref">Tenth Amendment</a>.  The District Court rejected respondents&#x92; challenges under the Spending Clause, Gerhardt v. Lazaroff, 221 F. Supp. 2d 827, 839&#x96;849 (SD Ohio 2002), and the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentx" class="subref" title="subref">Tenth Amendment</a>, id., at 850&#x96;851, and declined to reach the Commerce Clause ques-tion, id., at 838&#x96;839.  The Sixth Circuit, having determined that RLUIPA violates the Establishment Clause, did not rule on respondents&#x92; further arguments.  See 349 F. 3d 257, 259&#x96;260, 269 (2003).  Respondents renew those arguments in this Court.  They also augment their federalism-based or residual-powers contentions by asserting that, in the space between the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses, the States&#x92; choices are not subject to congressional oversight.  See Brief for Respondents 9, 25&#x96;33; cf. Madison v. Riter, 355 F. 3d 310, 322 (CA4 2003).  Because these defensive pleas were not addressed by the Court of Appeals, and mindful that we are a court of review, not of first view, we do not consider them here.  See F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v.

						 Directed at obstructions institutional arrangements place on religious observances, RLUIPA does not require a State to pay for an inmate&#x92;s devotional accessories.  See, e.g., Charles v.

						 Respondents argue, in line with the Sixth Circuit, that RLUIPA goes beyond permissible reduction of impediments to free exercise.  The Act, they project, advances religion by encouraging prisoners to &#x93;get religion,&#x94; and thereby gain accommodations afforded under RLUIPA.  Brief for Respondents 15&#x96;17; see 349 F. 3d, at 266 (&#x93;One effect of RLUIPA is to induce prisoners to adopt or feign religious belief in order to receive the statute&#x92;s benefits.&#x94;).  While some accommodations of religious observance, notably the opportunity to assemble in worship services, might attract joiners seeking a break in their closely guarded day, we doubt that all accommodations would be perceived as &#x93;benefits.&#x94;  For example, congressional hearings on RLUIPA revealed that one state corrections system served as its kosher diet &#x93;a fruit, a vegetable, a granola bar, and a liquid nutritional supplement&#x97;each and every meal.&#x94;  Protecting Religious Freedom, pt. 3, at 38 (statement of Jaroslawicz).


The argument, in any event, founders on the fact that Ohio already facilitates religious services for mainstream faiths.  The State provides chaplains, allows inmates to possess religious items, and permits assembly for worship.  See App. 199 (affidavit of David Schwarz, Religious Services Administrator for the South Region of the Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation and Correction (Oct. 19, 2000)) (job duties include &#x93;facilitating the delivery of religious services in 14 correctional institutions of various security levels throughout &#x2026; Ohio&#x94;); Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation and Correction, Table of Organization, available at http://www.drc.state.oh.us/web/DRCORG1.pdf (department includes &#x93;Religious Services&#x94; division) (as visited May 27, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file); Brief for United States 20, and n. 8 (citing, inter alia, Gawloski v. Dallman, 803 F. Supp. 103, 113 (SD Ohio 1992) (inmate in protective custody allowed to attend a congregational religious service, possess a Bible and other religious materials, and receive chaplain visits); Taylor v. Perini, 413 F. Supp. 189, 238 (ND Ohio 1976) (institutional chaplains had free access to correctional area)).

						 The Sixth Circuit posited that an irreligious prisoner and member of the Aryan Nation who challenges prison officials&#x92; confiscation of his white supremacist literature as a violation of his free association and expression rights would have his claims evaluated under the deferential rational-relationship standard described in Turner v. Safley, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/482/78" class="subref" title="subref">482 U. S. 78</a> (1987)
.  A member of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian challenging a similar withholding, the Sixth Circuit assumed, would have a stronger prospect of success because a court would review his claim under RLUIPA&#x92;s compelling-interest standard.  349 F. 3d, at 266 (citing Madison v. Riter, 240 F. Supp. 2d 566, 576 (WD Va. 2003)).  Courts, however, may be expected to recognize the government&#x92;s countervailing compelling interest in not facilitating inflammatory racist activity that could imperil prison security and order.  Cf. Reimann v. Murphy, 897 F. Supp. 398, 402&#x96;403 (ED Wis. 1995) (concluding, under RFRA, that excluding racist literature advocating violence was the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling state interest in preventing prison violence); George v. Sullivan, 896 F. Supp. 895, 898 (WD Wis. 1995) (same).

						 Respondents argue that prison gangs use religious activity to cloak their illicit and often violent conduct.  The instant case was considered below on a motion to dismiss.  Thus, the parties&#x92; conflicting assertions on this matter are not before us.  It bears repetition, however, that prison security is a compelling state interest, and that deference is due to institutional officials&#x92; expertise in this area.  See supra, at 12&#x96;13.  Further, prison officials may appropriately question whether a prisoner&#x92;s religiosity, asserted as the basis for a requested accommodation, is authentic.  Although RLUIPA bars inquiry into whether a particular belief or practice is &#x93;central&#x94; to a prisoner&#x92;s religion, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-5.html#7_A" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;5(7)(A)</a>, the Act does not preclude inquiry into the sincerity of a prisoner&#x92;s professed religiosity.  Cf. Gillette v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/437" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 437</a>,

 (&#x93; &#x91;[T]he &#x93;truth&#x94; of a belief is not open to question&#x92;; rather, the question is whether the objector&#x92;s beliefs are &#x91;truly held.&#x92; &#x94; (quoting United States v. Seeger,

				 we invalidated a state law that carved out a separate school district to serve exclusively a community of highly religious Jews, the Satmar Hasidim.

				&#x93;For more than a decade, the federal Bureau of Prisons has managed the largest correctional system in the Nation under the same heightened scrutiny standard as RLUIPA without compromising prison security, public safety, or the constitutional rights of other prisoners.&#x94;  Brief for United States 24 (citation omitted).  The Congress that enacted RLUIPA was aware of the Bureau&#x92;s experience.  See Joint Statement S7776 (letter from Department of Justice to Senator Hatch) (&#x93;[W]e do not believe [RLUIPA] would have an unreasonable impact on prison operations.  RFRA has been in effect in the Federal prison system for six years and compliance with that statute has not been an unreasonable burden to the Federal prison system.&#x94;).  We see no reason to anticipate that abusive prisoner litigation will overburden the operations of state and local institutions.  The procedures mandated by the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we note, are designed to inhibit frivolous filings.

Flores, before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 3, p. 11, n. 1 (1998) (hereinafter Protecting Religious Freedom) (prepared statement of Marc D. Stern, Legal Director, American Jewish Congress).  Across the country, Jewish inmates complained that prison officials refused to provide sack lunches, which would enable inmates to break their fasts after nightfall.  Id., at 39 (statement of Isaac M. Jaroslawicz, Director of Legal Affairs for the Aleph Institute).  The &#x93;Michigan Department of Corrections &#x2026; prohibit[ed] the lighting of Chanukah candles at all state prisons&#x94; even though &#x93;smoking&#x94; and &#x93;votive candles&#x94; were permitted.

A priest responsible for communications between Roman Catholic dioceses and corrections facilities in Oklahoma stated that there &#x93;was [a] nearly yearly battle over the Catholic use of Sacramental Wine &#x2026; for the celebration of the Mass,&#x94; and that prisoners&#x92; religious possessions, &#x93;such as the Bible, the Koran, the Talmud or items needed by Native Americans[,] &#x2026; were frequently treated with contempt and were confiscated, damaged or discarded&#x94; by prison officials.

						 Respondents argued below that RLUIPA exceeds Congress&#x92; legislative powers under the Spending and Commerce Clauses and violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentx" class="subref" title="subref">Tenth Amendment</a>.  The District Court rejected respondents&#x92; challenges under the Spending Clause, Gerhardt v. Lazaroff, 221 F. Supp. 2d 827, 839&#x96;849 (SD Ohio 2002), and the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentx" class="subref" title="subref">Tenth Amendment</a>, id., at 850&#x96;851, and declined to reach the Commerce Clause ques-tion, id., at 838&#x96;839.  The Sixth Circuit, having determined that RLUIPA violates the Establishment Clause, did not rule on respondents&#x92; further arguments.  See 349 F. 3d 257, 259&#x96;260, 269 (2003).  Respondents renew those arguments in this Court.  They also augment their federalism-based or residual-powers contentions by asserting that, in the space between the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses, the States&#x92; choices are not subject to congressional oversight.  See Brief for Respondents 9, 25&#x96;33; cf. Madison v. Riter, 355 F. 3d 310, 322 (CA4 2003).  Because these defensive pleas were not addressed by the Court of Appeals, and mindful that we are a court of review, not of first view, we do not consider them here.  See F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v.

						 Directed at obstructions institutional arrangements place on religious observances, RLUIPA does not require a State to pay for an inmate&#x92;s devotional accessories.  See, e.g., Charles v.

						 Respondents argue, in line with the Sixth Circuit, that RLUIPA goes beyond permissible reduction of impediments to free exercise.  The Act, they project, advances religion by encouraging prisoners to &#x93;get religion,&#x94; and thereby gain accommodations afforded under RLUIPA.  Brief for Respondents 15&#x96;17; see 349 F. 3d, at 266 (&#x93;One effect of RLUIPA is to induce prisoners to adopt or feign religious belief in order to receive the statute&#x92;s benefits.&#x94;).  While some accommodations of religious observance, notably the opportunity to assemble in worship services, might attract joiners seeking a break in their closely guarded day, we doubt that all accommodations would be perceived as &#x93;benefits.&#x94;  For example, congressional hearings on RLUIPA revealed that one state corrections system served as its kosher diet &#x93;a fruit, a vegetable, a granola bar, and a liquid nutritional supplement&#x97;each and every meal.&#x94;  Protecting Religious Freedom, pt. 3, at 38 (statement of Jaroslawicz).


The argument, in any event, founders on the fact that Ohio already facilitates religious services for mainstream faiths.  The State provides chaplains, allows inmates to possess religious items, and permits assembly for worship.  See App. 199 (affidavit of David Schwarz, Religious Services Administrator for the South Region of the Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation and Correction (Oct. 19, 2000)) (job duties include &#x93;facilitating the delivery of religious services in 14 correctional institutions of various security levels throughout &#x2026; Ohio&#x94;); Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation and Correction, Table of Organization, available at http://www.drc.state.oh.us/web/DRCORG1.pdf (department includes &#x93;Religious Services&#x94; division) (as visited May 27, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file); Brief for United States 20, and n. 8 (citing, inter alia, Gawloski v. Dallman, 803 F. Supp. 103, 113 (SD Ohio 1992) (inmate in protective custody allowed to attend a congregational religious service, possess a Bible and other religious materials, and receive chaplain visits); Taylor v. Perini, 413 F. Supp. 189, 238 (ND Ohio 1976) (institutional chaplains had free access to correctional area)).

						 The Sixth Circuit posited that an irreligious prisoner and member of the Aryan Nation who challenges prison officials&#x92; confiscation of his white supremacist literature as a violation of his free association and expression rights would have his claims evaluated under the deferential rational-relationship standard described in Turner v. Safley, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/482/78" class="subref" title="subref">482 U. S. 78</a> (1987)
.  A member of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian challenging a similar withholding, the Sixth Circuit assumed, would have a stronger prospect of success because a court would review his claim under RLUIPA&#x92;s compelling-interest standard.  349 F. 3d, at 266 (citing Madison v. Riter, 240 F. Supp. 2d 566, 576 (WD Va. 2003)).  Courts, however, may be expected to recognize the government&#x92;s countervailing compelling interest in not facilitating inflammatory racist activity that could imperil prison security and order.  Cf. Reimann v. Murphy, 897 F. Supp. 398, 402&#x96;403 (ED Wis. 1995) (concluding, under RFRA, that excluding racist literature advocating violence was the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling state interest in preventing prison violence); George v. Sullivan, 896 F. Supp. 895, 898 (WD Wis. 1995) (same).

						 Respondents argue that prison gangs use religious activity to cloak their illicit and often violent conduct.  The instant case was considered below on a motion to dismiss.  Thus, the parties&#x92; conflicting assertions on this matter are not before us.  It bears repetition, however, that prison security is a compelling state interest, and that deference is due to institutional officials&#x92; expertise in this area.  See supra, at 12&#x96;13.  Further, prison officials may appropriately question whether a prisoner&#x92;s religiosity, asserted as the basis for a requested accommodation, is authentic.  Although RLUIPA bars inquiry into whether a particular belief or practice is &#x93;central&#x94; to a prisoner&#x92;s religion, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-5.html#7_A" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;5(7)(A)</a>, the Act does not preclude inquiry into the sincerity of a prisoner&#x92;s professed religiosity.  Cf. Gillette v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/437" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 437</a>,

 (&#x93; &#x91;[T]he &#x93;truth&#x94; of a belief is not open to question&#x92;; rather, the question is whether the objector&#x92;s beliefs are &#x91;truly held.&#x92; &#x94; (quoting United States v. Seeger,

				 we invalidated a state law that carved out a separate school district to serve exclusively a community of highly religious Jews, the Satmar Hasidim.

				&#x93;For more than a decade, the federal Bureau of Prisons has managed the largest correctional system in the Nation under the same heightened scrutiny standard as RLUIPA without compromising prison security, public safety, or the constitutional rights of other prisoners.&#x94;  Brief for United States 24 (citation omitted).  The Congress that enacted RLUIPA was aware of the Bureau&#x92;s experience.  See Joint Statement S7776 (letter from Department of Justice to Senator Hatch) (&#x93;[W]e do not believe [RLUIPA] would have an unreasonable impact on prison operations.  RFRA has been in effect in the Federal prison system for six years and compliance with that statute has not been an unreasonable burden to the Federal prison system.&#x94;).  We see no reason to anticipate that abusive prisoner litigation will overburden the operations of state and local institutions.  The procedures mandated by the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we note, are designed to inhibit frivolous filings.

Flores, before the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 105th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 3, p. 11, n. 1 (1998) (hereinafter Protecting Religious Freedom) (prepared statement of Marc D.

Across the country, Jewish inmates complained that prison officials refused to provide sack lunches, which would enable inmates to break their fasts after nightfall.  Id., at 39 (statement of Isaac M. Jaroslawicz, Director of Legal Affairs for the Aleph Institute).  The &#x93;Michigan Department of Corrections &#x2026; prohibit[ed] the lighting of Chanukah candles at all state prisons&#x94; even though &#x93;smoking&#x94; and &#x93;votive candles&#x94; were permitted.

						 Respondents argued below that RLUIPA exceeds Congress&#x92; legislative powers under the Spending and Commerce Clauses and violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentx" class="subref" title="subref">Tenth Amendment</a>.  The District Court rejected respondents&#x92; challenges under the Spending Clause, Gerhardt v. Lazaroff, 221 F. Supp. 2d 827, 839&#x96;849 (SD Ohio 2002), and the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentx" class="subref" title="subref">Tenth Amendment</a>, id., at 850&#x96;851, and declined to reach the Commerce Clause ques-tion, id., at 838&#x96;839.  The Sixth Circuit, having determined that RLUIPA violates the Establishment Clause, did not rule on respondents&#x92; further arguments.  See 349 F. 3d 257, 259&#x96;260, 269 (2003).  Respondents renew those arguments in this Court.  They also augment their federalism-based or residual-powers contentions by asserting that, in the space between the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses, the States&#x92; choices are not subject to congressional oversight.  See Brief for Respondents 9, 25&#x96;33; cf. Madison v. Riter, 355 F. 3d 310, 322 (CA4 2003).  Because these defensive pleas were not addressed by the Court of Appeals, and mindful that we are a court of review, not of first view, we do not consider them here.  See F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd v.

						 Directed at obstructions institutional arrangements place on religious observances, RLUIPA does not require a State to pay for an inmate&#x92;s devotional accessories.  See, e.g., Charles v.

						 Respondents argue, in line with the Sixth Circuit, that RLUIPA goes beyond permissible reduction of impediments to free exercise.  The Act, they project, advances religion by encouraging prisoners to &#x93;get religion,&#x94; and thereby gain accommodations afforded under RLUIPA.  Brief for Respondents 15&#x96;17; see 349 F. 3d, at 266 (&#x93;One effect of RLUIPA is to induce prisoners to adopt or feign religious belief in order to receive the statute&#x92;s benefits.&#x94;).  While some accommodations of religious observance, notably the opportunity to assemble in worship services, might attract joiners seeking a break in their closely guarded day, we doubt that all accommodations would be perceived as &#x93;benefits.&#x94;  For example, congressional hearings on RLUIPA revealed that one state corrections system served as its kosher diet &#x93;a fruit, a vegetable, a granola bar, and a liquid nutritional supplement&#x97;each and every meal.&#x94;  Protecting Religious Freedom, pt. 3, at 38 (statement of Jaroslawicz).


The argument, in any event, founders on the fact that Ohio already facilitates religious services for mainstream faiths.  The State provides chaplains, allows inmates to possess religious items, and permits assembly for worship.  See App. 199 (affidavit of David Schwarz, Religious Services Administrator for the South Region of the Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation and Correction (Oct. 19, 2000)) (job duties include &#x93;facilitating the delivery of religious services in 14 correctional institutions of various security levels throughout &#x2026; Ohio&#x94;); Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation and Correction, Table of Organization, available at http://www.drc.state.oh.us/web/DRCORG1.pdf (department includes &#x93;Religious Services&#x94; division) (as visited May 27, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file); Brief for United States 20, and n. 8 (citing, inter alia, Gawloski v. Dallman, 803 F. Supp. 103, 113 (SD Ohio 1992) (inmate in protective custody allowed to attend a congregational religious service, possess a Bible and other religious materials, and receive chaplain visits); Taylor v. Perini, 413 F. Supp. 189, 238 (ND Ohio 1976) (institutional chaplains had free access to correctional area)).

						 The Sixth Circuit posited that an irreligious prisoner and member of the Aryan Nation who challenges prison officials&#x92; confiscation of his white supremacist literature as a violation of his free association and expression rights would have his claims evaluated under the deferential rational-relationship standard described in Turner v. Safley, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/482/78" class="subref" title="subref">482 U. S. 78</a> (1987)
.  A member of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian challenging a similar withholding, the Sixth Circuit assumed, would have a stronger prospect of success because a court would review his claim under RLUIPA&#x92;s compelling-interest standard.  349 F. 3d, at 266 (citing Madison v. Riter, 240 F. Supp. 2d 566, 576 (WD Va. 2003)).  Courts, however, may be expected to recognize the government&#x92;s countervailing compelling interest in not facilitating inflammatory racist activity that could imperil prison security and order.  Cf. Reimann v. Murphy, 897 F. Supp. 398, 402&#x96;403 (ED Wis. 1995) (concluding, under RFRA, that excluding racist literature advocating violence was the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling state interest in preventing prison violence); George v. Sullivan, 896 F. Supp. 895, 898 (WD Wis. 1995) (same).

						 Respondents argue that prison gangs use religious activity to cloak their illicit and often violent conduct.  The instant case was considered below on a motion to dismiss.  Thus, the parties&#x92; conflicting assertions on this matter are not before us.  It bears repetition, however, that prison security is a compelling state interest, and that deference is due to institutional officials&#x92; expertise in this area.  See supra, at 12&#x96;13.  Further, prison officials may appropriately question whether a prisoner&#x92;s religiosity, asserted as the basis for a requested accommodation, is authentic.  Although RLUIPA bars inquiry into whether a particular belief or practice is &#x93;central&#x94; to a prisoner&#x92;s religion, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-5.html#7_A" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;5(7)(A)</a>, the Act does not preclude inquiry into the sincerity of a prisoner&#x92;s professed religiosity.  Cf. Gillette v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/401/437" class="subref" title="subref">401 U. S. 437</a>,

 (&#x93; &#x91;[T]he &#x93;truth&#x94; of a belief is not open to question&#x92;; rather, the question is whether the objector&#x92;s beliefs are &#x91;truly held.&#x92; &#x94; (quoting United States v. Seeger,

The Congress that enacted RLUIPA was aware of the Bureau&#x92;s experience.

We see no reason to anticipate that abusive prisoner litigation will overburden the operations of state and local institutions.  The procedures mandated by the Prison Litigation Reform Act of 1995, we note, are designed to inhibit frivolous filings.

						 Respondents argued below that RLUIPA exceeds Congress&#x92; legislative powers under the Spending and Commerce Clauses and violates the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentx" class="subref" title="subref">Tenth Amendment</a>.  The District Court rejected respondents&#x92; challenges under the Spending Clause, Gerhardt v. Lazaroff, 221 F. Supp. 2d 827, 839&#x96;849 (SD Ohio 2002), and the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentx" class="subref" title="subref">Tenth Amendment</a>, id., at 850&#x96;851, and declined to reach the Commerce Clause ques-tion, id., at 838&#x96;839.  The Sixth Circuit, having determined that RLUIPA violates the Establishment Clause, did not rule on respondents&#x92; further arguments.  See 349 F. 3d 257, 259&#x96;260, 269 (2003).  Respondents renew those arguments in this Court.  They also augment their federalism-based or residual-powers contentions by asserting that, in the space between the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses, the States&#x92; choices are not subject to congressional oversight.  See Brief for Respondents 9, 25&#x96;33; cf. Madison v. Riter, 355 F. 3d 310, 322 (CA4 2003).

						 Respondents argue, in line with the Sixth Circuit, that RLUIPA goes beyond permissible reduction of impediments to free exercise.  The Act, they project, advances religion by encouraging prisoners to &#x93;get religion,&#x94; and thereby gain accommodations afforded under RLUIPA.  Brief for Respondents 15&#x96;17; see 349 F. 3d, at 266 (&#x93;One effect of RLUIPA is to induce prisoners to adopt or feign religious belief in order to receive the statute&#x92;s benefits.&#x94;).  While some accommodations of religious observance, notably the opportunity to assemble in worship services, might attract joiners seeking a break in their closely guarded day, we doubt that all accommodations would be perceived as &#x93;benefits.&#x94;  For example, congressional hearings on RLUIPA revealed that one state corrections system served as its kosher diet &#x93;a fruit, a vegetable, a granola bar, and a liquid nutritional supplement&#x97;each and every meal.&#x94;  Protecting Religious Freedom, pt. 3, at 38 (statement of Jaroslawicz).


The argument, in any event, founders on the fact that Ohio already facilitates religious services for mainstream faiths.  The State provides chaplains, allows inmates to possess religious items, and permits assembly for worship.  See App. 199 (affidavit of David Schwarz, Religious Services Administrator for the South Region of the Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation and Correction (Oct. 19, 2000)) (job duties include &#x93;facilitating the delivery of religious services in 14 correctional institutions of various security levels throughout &#x2026; Ohio&#x94;); Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation and Correction, Table of Organization, available at http://www.drc.state.oh.us/web/DRCORG1.pdf (department includes &#x93;Religious Services&#x94; division) (as visited May 27, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court&#x92;s case file); Brief for United States 20, and n. 8 (citing, inter alia, Gawloski v. Dallman, 803 F. Supp. 103, 113 (SD Ohio 1992) (inmate in protective custody allowed to attend a congregational religious service, possess a Bible and other religious materials, and receive chaplain visits); Taylor v.

						 The Sixth Circuit posited that an irreligious prisoner and member of the Aryan Nation who challenges prison officials&#x92; confiscation of his white supremacist literature as a violation of his free association and expression rights would have his claims evaluated under the deferential rational-relationship standard described in Turner v. Safley, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/482/78" class="subref" title="subref">482 U. S. 78</a> (1987)
.  A member of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian challenging a similar withholding, the Sixth Circuit assumed, would have a stronger prospect of success because a court would review his claim under RLUIPA&#x92;s compelling-interest standard.  349 F. 3d, at 266 (citing Madison v. Riter, 240 F. Supp. 2d 566, 576 (WD Va. 2003)).  Courts, however, may be expected to recognize the government&#x92;s countervailing compelling interest in not facilitating inflammatory racist activity that could imperil prison security and order.  Cf. Reimann v. Murphy, 897 F. Supp. 398, 402&#x96;403 (ED Wis. 1995) (concluding, under RFRA, that excluding racist literature advocating violence was the least restrictive means of furthering the compelling state interest in preventing prison violence); George v.

						 Respondents argue that prison gangs use religious activity to cloak their illicit and often violent conduct.  The instant case was considered below on a motion to dismiss.  Thus, the parties&#x92; conflicting assertions on this matter are not before us.  It bears repetition, however, that prison security is a compelling state interest, and that deference is due to institutional officials&#x92; expertise in this area.  See supra, at 12&#x96;13.  Further, prison officials may appropriately question whether a prisoner&#x92;s religiosity, asserted as the basis for a requested accommodation, is authentic.  Although RLUIPA bars inquiry into whether a particular belief or practice is &#x93;central&#x94; to a prisoner&#x92;s religion, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-5.html#7_A" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;5(7)(A)</a>, the Act does not preclude inquiry into the sincerity of a prisoner&#x92;s professed religiosity.  Cf. Gillette v. United States,

 (&#x93; &#x91;[T]he &#x93;truth&#x94; of a belief is not open to question&#x92;; rather, the question is whether the objector&#x92;s beliefs are &#x91;truly held.&#x92; &#x94; (quoting United States v. Seeger,

				History, at least that presented by Ohio, does not show that the Clause hermetically seals the Federal Government out of the field of religion.  Ohio points to, among other things, the words of James Madison in defense of the Constitution at the Virginia Ratifying Convention: &#x93;There is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion.  Its least interference with it would be a most flagrant usurpation.&#x94;  General Defense of the Constitution (June 12, 1788), reprinted in 11 Papers of James Madison 130 (R. Rutland, C. Hobson, W. Rachal, &amp; J. Sisson eds. 1977).  Ohio also relies on James Iredell&#x92;s statement discussing the Religious Test Clause at the North Carolina Ratifying Convention: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[Congress] certainly [has] no authority to interfere in the establishment of any religion whatsoever &#x2026; .  Is there any power given to Congress in matters of religion?  Can they pass a single act to impair our religious liberties?  If they could, it would be a just cause of alarm &#x2026; .  If any future Congress should pass an act concerning the religion of the country, it would be an act which they are not authorized to pass, by the Constitution, and which the people would not obey.&#x94;  Debate in North Carolina Ratifying Convention (June 30, 1788), in 5 Founders&#x92; Constitution 90 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				These quotations do not establish the Framers&#x92; beliefs about the scope of the Establishment Clause.  Instead, they demonstrate only that some of the Framers may have believed that the National Government had no authority to legislate concerning religion, because no enumerated power gave it that authority.  Ohio&#x92;s Spending Clause and Commerce Clause challenges, therefore, may well have merit.  See n. 2, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In any event, Ohio has not shown that the Establishment Clause codified Madison&#x92;s or Iredell&#x92;s view that the Federal Government could not legislate regarding religion.  An 
				<em>
					unenacted
				</em>
				 version of the Clause, proposed in the House of Representatives, demonstrates the opposite.  It provided that &#x93;Congress shall make no laws touching religion, or infringing the rights of conscience.&#x94;  1 Annals of Cong. 731 (1789); see also

				Nor does the other historical evidence on which Ohio relies&#x97;Joseph Story&#x92;s Commentaries on the Constitution&#x97;prove its theory.  Leaving aside the problems with relying on this source as an indicator of the original understanding, see

 (

				, dissenting), it is unpersuasive in its own right.  Justice Story did say that &#x93;the whole power over the subject of religion is left exclusively to the state governments, to be acted upon according to their own sense of justice, and the state constitutions.&#x94;  Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 702&#x96;703 (1833) (reprinted 1987).  In context, however, his statement concerned only Congress&#x92; inability to legislate with respect to religious 
				<em>
					establishment
				</em>
				.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 701 (&#x93;The real object of the amendment was &#x2026; to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment, which should give to an hierarchy the exclusive patronage of the national government&#x94;); 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 702 (&#x93;[I]t was deemed advisable to exclude from the national government all power to act upon the subject &#x2026; . It was impossible, that there should not arise perpetual strife and perpetual jealousy on the subject of ecclesiastical ascendancy, if the national government were left free to create a religious establishment&#x94;).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In short, the view that the Establishment Clause precludes Congress from legislating respecting religion lacks historical provenance, at least based on the history of which I am aware.  Even when enacting laws that bind the States pursuant to valid exercises of its enumerated powers, Congress need not observe strict separation between church and state, or steer clear of the subject of religion.  It need only refrain from making laws &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion&#x94;; it must not interfere with a state establishment of religion.  For example, Congress presumably could not require a State to establish a religion any more than it could preclude a State from establishing a religion.

				On its face&#x97;the relevant inquiry, as this is a facial challenge&#x97;RLUIPA is not a law &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion.&#x94;  RLUIPA provides, as relevant: &#x93;No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, &#x2026; even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,&#x94; first, &#x93;further[s] a compelling governmental interest,&#x94; and second, &#x93;is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-1.html#a_1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(a)(1)</a>&#x96;(2).  This provision does not prohibit or interfere with state establishments, since no State has established (or constitutionally could establish, given an incorporated Clause) a religion.  Nor does the provision require a State to establish a religion: It does not force a State to coerce religious observance or payment of taxes supporting clergy, or require a State to prefer one religious sect over another.  It is a law respecting religion, but not one respecting an establishment of religion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In addition, RLUIPA&#x92;s text applies to all laws passed by state and local governments, including &#x93;rule[s] of general applicability,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, whether or not they concern an establishment of religion.  State and local governments obviously have many laws that have nothing to do with religion, let alone establishments thereof.  Numerous applications of RLUIPA therefore do not contravene the Establishment Clause, and a facial challenge based on the Clause must fail.  See

				It also bears noting that Congress, pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, conditioned the States&#x92; receipt of federal funds on their compliance with RLUIPA.  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(b)(1) (&#x93;This section applies in any case in which &#x2026; the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance&#x94;).  As noted above, n. 2, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, RLUIPA may well exceed the spending power.  Nonetheless, while Congress&#x92; condition stands, the States subject themselves to that condition by voluntarily accepting federal funds.  The States&#x92; voluntary acceptance of Congress&#x92; condition undercuts Ohio&#x92;s argument that Congress is encroaching on its turf.

						 The Court properly declines to assess RLUIPA under the discredited test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/602" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 602</a> (1971)
, which the Court of Appeals applied below, 349 F. 3d 257, 262&#x96;268 (CA6 2003).  Lemon held that, to avoid invalidation under the Establishment Clause, a statute &#x93;must have a secular legislative purpose,&#x94; &#x93;its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion,&#x94; and it &#x93;must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.&#x94;  403 U. S., at 612&#x96;613 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Under the first and second prongs, RLUIPA&#x97;and, indeed, any accommodation of religion&#x97;might well violate the Clause.  Even laws disestablishing religion might violate the Clause.  Disestablishment might easily have a religious purpose and thereby flunk the first prong, or it might well &#x93;strengthen and revitalize&#x94; religion and so fail the second.  McConnell, Establishment and Disestablishment at the Founding, Part I: Establishment of Religion, 44 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 2105, 2206&#x96;2207 (2003) (hereinafter McConnell).

						 The Court dismisses the parties&#x92; arguments about the federalism aspect of the Clause with the brief observation that the Court of Appeals did not address the issue.  Ante, at 7&#x96;8, n. 7.  The parties&#x92; contentions on this point, however, are fairly included in the question presented, which asks &#x93;[w]hether Congress violated the Establishment Clause by enacting [RLUIPA].&#x94;  Pet. for Cert. i.  Further, both parties have briefed the federalism understanding of the Clause, Brief for Respondents 25&#x96;33; Reply Brief for Petitioners 12&#x96;16, and neither suggests that a remand on it would be useful or that the record in this Court lacks relevant facts, Good News Club v. Milford Central School,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">9</a> (2001)
.


Also, though RLUIPA is entirely consonant with the Establishment Clause, it may well exceed Congress&#x92; authority under either the Spending Clause or the Commerce Clause. See Sabri v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/600" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 600</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">613</a> (2004)
 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (for a spending clause condition on a State&#x92;s receipt of funds to be &#x93;Necessary and Proper&#x94; to the expenditure of the funds, there must be &#x93;some obvious, simple, and direct relation&#x94; between the condition and the expenditure of the funds); United States v. Lopez,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">587</a> (1995)
 (Thomas, J., concurring) (&#x93;The Constitution not only uses the word &#x91;commerce&#x92; in a narrower sense than our case law might suggest, it also does not support the proposition that Congress has authority over all activities that &#x91;substantially affect&#x92; interstate commerce&#x94;).  The Court, however, properly declines to reach those issues, since they are outside the question presented and were not addressed by the Court of Appeals.

				History, at least that presented by Ohio, does not show that the Clause hermetically seals the Federal Government out of the field of religion.  Ohio points to, among other things, the words of James Madison in defense of the Constitution at the Virginia Ratifying Convention: &#x93;There is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion.  Its least interference with it would be a most flagrant usurpation.&#x94;  General Defense of the Constitution (June 12, 1788), reprinted in 11 Papers of James Madison 130 (R. Rutland, C. Hobson, W. Rachal, &amp; J. Sisson eds. 1977).  Ohio also relies on James Iredell&#x92;s statement discussing the Religious Test Clause at the North Carolina Ratifying Convention: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[Congress] certainly [has] no authority to interfere in the establishment of any religion whatsoever &#x2026; .  Is there any power given to Congress in matters of religion?  Can they pass a single act to impair our religious liberties?  If they could, it would be a just cause of alarm &#x2026; .  If any future Congress should pass an act concerning the religion of the country, it would be an act which they are not authorized to pass, by the Constitution, and which the people would not obey.&#x94;  Debate in North Carolina Ratifying Convention (June 30, 1788), in 5 Founders&#x92; Constitution 90 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				These quotations do not establish the Framers&#x92; beliefs about the scope of the Establishment Clause.  Instead, they demonstrate only that some of the Framers may have believed that the National Government had no authority to legislate concerning religion, because no enumerated power gave it that authority.  Ohio&#x92;s Spending Clause and Commerce Clause challenges, therefore, may well have merit.  See n. 2,

				In any event, Ohio has not shown that the Establishment Clause codified Madison&#x92;s or Iredell&#x92;s view that the Federal Government could not legislate regarding religion.  An

				</em>
				 version of the Clause, proposed in the House of Representatives, demonstrates the opposite.  It provided that &#x93;Congress shall make no laws touching religion, or infringing the rights of conscience.&#x94;  1 Annals of Cong. 731 (1789); see also

Justice Story did say that &#x93;the whole power over the subject of religion is left exclusively to the state governments, to be acted upon according to their own sense of justice, and the state constitutions.&#x94;  Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 702&#x96;703 (1833) (reprinted 1987).  In context, however, his statement concerned only Congress&#x92; inability to legislate with respect to religious 
				<em>
					establishment
				</em>
				.  See 
				<em>

				</em>
				 at 701 (&#x93;The real object of the amendment was &#x2026; to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment, which should give to an hierarchy the exclusive patronage of the national government&#x94;);

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In short, the view that the Establishment Clause precludes Congress from legislating respecting religion lacks historical provenance, at least based on the history of which I am aware.  Even when enacting laws that bind the States pursuant to valid exercises of its enumerated powers, Congress need not observe strict separation between church and state, or steer clear of the subject of religion.  It need only refrain from making laws &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion&#x94;; it must not interfere with a state establishment of religion.  For example, Congress presumably could not require a State to establish a religion any more than it could preclude a State from establishing a religion.

				On its face&#x97;the relevant inquiry, as this is a facial challenge&#x97;RLUIPA is not a law &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion.&#x94;  RLUIPA provides, as relevant: &#x93;No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, &#x2026; even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,&#x94; first, &#x93;further[s] a compelling governmental interest,&#x94; and second, &#x93;is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-1.html#a_1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(a)(1)</a>&#x96;(2).  This provision does not prohibit or interfere with state establishments, since no State has established (or constitutionally could establish, given an incorporated Clause) a religion.  Nor does the provision require a State to establish a religion: It does not force a State to coerce religious observance or payment of taxes supporting clergy, or require a State to prefer one religious sect over another.  It is a law respecting religion, but not one respecting an establishment of religion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In addition, RLUIPA&#x92;s text applies to all laws passed by state and local governments, including &#x93;rule[s] of general applicability,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, whether or not they concern an establishment of religion.  State and local governments obviously have many laws that have nothing to do with religion, let alone establishments thereof.  Numerous applications of RLUIPA therefore do not contravene the Establishment Clause, and a facial challenge based on the Clause must fail.  See

				It also bears noting that Congress, pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, conditioned the States&#x92; receipt of federal funds on their compliance with RLUIPA.  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(b)(1) (&#x93;This section applies in any case in which &#x2026; the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance&#x94;).  As noted above, n. 2, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, RLUIPA may well exceed the spending power.  Nonetheless, while Congress&#x92; condition stands, the States subject themselves to that condition by voluntarily accepting federal funds.  The States&#x92; voluntary acceptance of Congress&#x92; condition undercuts Ohio&#x92;s argument that Congress is encroaching on its turf.

						 The Court properly declines to assess RLUIPA under the discredited test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/602" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 602</a> (1971)
, which the Court of Appeals applied below, 349 F. 3d 257, 262&#x96;268 (CA6 2003).  Lemon held that, to avoid invalidation under the Establishment Clause, a statute &#x93;must have a secular legislative purpose,&#x94; &#x93;its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion,&#x94; and it &#x93;must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.&#x94;  403 U. S., at 612&#x96;613 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Under the first and second prongs, RLUIPA&#x97;and, indeed, any accommodation of religion&#x97;might well violate the Clause.  Even laws disestablishing religion might violate the Clause.  Disestablishment might easily have a religious purpose and thereby flunk the first prong, or it might well &#x93;strengthen and revitalize&#x94; religion and so fail the second.

						 The Court dismisses the parties&#x92; arguments about the federalism aspect of the Clause with the brief observation that the Court of Appeals did not address the issue.  Ante, at 7&#x96;8, n. 7.  The parties&#x92; contentions on this point, however, are fairly included in the question presented, which asks &#x93;[w]hether Congress violated the Establishment Clause by enacting [RLUIPA].&#x94;  Pet. for Cert. i.  Further, both parties have briefed the federalism understanding of the Clause, Brief for Respondents 25&#x96;33; Reply Brief for Petitioners 12&#x96;16, and neither suggests that a remand on it would be useful or that the record in this Court lacks relevant facts, Good News Club v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">9</a> (2001)
.


Also, though RLUIPA is entirely consonant with the Establishment Clause, it may well exceed Congress&#x92; authority under either the Spending Clause or the Commerce Clause. See Sabri v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/600" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 600</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">613</a> (2004)
 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (for a spending clause condition on a State&#x92;s receipt of funds to be &#x93;Necessary and Proper&#x94; to the expenditure of the funds, there must be &#x93;some obvious, simple, and direct relation&#x94; between the condition and the expenditure of the funds); United States v. Lopez, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/549" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 549</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">587</a> (1995)
 (Thomas, J., concurring) (&#x93;The Constitution not only uses the word &#x91;commerce&#x92; in a narrower sense than our case law might suggest, it also does not support the proposition that Congress has authority over all activities that &#x91;substantially affect&#x92; interstate commerce&#x94;).  The Court, however, properly declines to reach those issues, since they are outside the question presented and were not addressed by the Court of Appeals.

				History, at least that presented by Ohio, does not show that the Clause hermetically seals the Federal Government out of the field of religion.  Ohio points to, among other things, the words of James Madison in defense of the Constitution at the Virginia Ratifying Convention: &#x93;There is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion.  Its least interference with it would be a most flagrant usurpation.&#x94;  General Defense of the Constitution (June 12, 1788), reprinted in 11 Papers of James Madison 130 (R. Rutland, C. Hobson, W. Rachal, &amp; J. Sisson eds. 1977).  Ohio also relies on James Iredell&#x92;s statement discussing the Religious Test Clause at the North Carolina Ratifying Convention: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[Congress] certainly [has] no authority to interfere in the establishment of any religion whatsoever &#x2026; .  Is there any power given to Congress in matters of religion?  Can they pass a single act to impair our religious liberties?  If they could, it would be a just cause of alarm &#x2026; .  If any future Congress should pass an act concerning the religion of the country, it would be an act which they are not authorized to pass, by the Constitution, and which the people would not obey.&#x94;  Debate in North Carolina Ratifying Convention (June 30, 1788), in 5 Founders&#x92; Constitution 90 (P.

				These quotations do not establish the Framers&#x92; beliefs about the scope of the Establishment Clause.  Instead, they demonstrate only that some of the Framers may have believed that the National Government had no authority to legislate concerning religion, because no enumerated power gave it that authority.  Ohio&#x92;s Spending Clause and Commerce Clause challenges, therefore, may well have merit.  See n. 2,

Justice Story did say that &#x93;the whole power over the subject of religion is left exclusively to the state governments, to be acted upon according to their own sense of justice, and the state constitutions.&#x94;  Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 702&#x96;703 (1833) (reprinted 1987).  In context, however, his statement concerned only Congress&#x92; inability to legislate with respect to religious 
				<em>

				 at 701 (&#x93;The real object of the amendment was &#x2026; to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment, which should give to an hierarchy the exclusive patronage of the national government&#x94;);

				In short, the view that the Establishment Clause precludes Congress from legislating respecting religion lacks historical provenance, at least based on the history of which I am aware.  Even when enacting laws that bind the States pursuant to valid exercises of its enumerated powers, Congress need not observe strict separation between church and state, or steer clear of the subject of religion.  It need only refrain from making laws &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion&#x94;; it must not interfere with a state establishment of religion.  For example, Congress presumably could not require a State to establish a religion any more than it could preclude a State from establishing a religion.

				On its face&#x97;the relevant inquiry, as this is a facial challenge&#x97;RLUIPA is not a law &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion.&#x94;  RLUIPA provides, as relevant: &#x93;No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, &#x2026; even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,&#x94; first, &#x93;further[s] a compelling governmental interest,&#x94; and second, &#x93;is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-1.html#a_1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(a)(1)</a>&#x96;(2).  This provision does not prohibit or interfere with state establishments, since no State has established (or constitutionally could establish, given an incorporated Clause) a religion.  Nor does the provision require a State to establish a religion: It does not force a State to coerce religious observance or payment of taxes supporting clergy, or require a State to prefer one religious sect over another.  It is a law respecting religion, but not one respecting an establishment of religion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In addition, RLUIPA&#x92;s text applies to all laws passed by state and local governments, including &#x93;rule[s] of general applicability,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, whether or not they concern an establishment of religion.  State and local governments obviously have many laws that have nothing to do with religion, let alone establishments thereof.  Numerous applications of RLUIPA therefore do not contravene the Establishment Clause, and a facial challenge based on the Clause must fail.  See

				It also bears noting that Congress, pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, conditioned the States&#x92; receipt of federal funds on their compliance with RLUIPA.  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(b)(1) (&#x93;This section applies in any case in which &#x2026; the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance&#x94;).  As noted above, n. 2, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, RLUIPA may well exceed the spending power.  Nonetheless, while Congress&#x92; condition stands, the States subject themselves to that condition by voluntarily accepting federal funds.  The States&#x92; voluntary acceptance of Congress&#x92; condition undercuts Ohio&#x92;s argument that Congress is encroaching on its turf.

						 The Court properly declines to assess RLUIPA under the discredited test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/602" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 602</a> (1971)
, which the Court of Appeals applied below, 349 F. 3d 257, 262&#x96;268 (CA6 2003).  Lemon held that, to avoid invalidation under the Establishment Clause, a statute &#x93;must have a secular legislative purpose,&#x94; &#x93;its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion,&#x94; and it &#x93;must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.&#x94;  403 U. S., at 612&#x96;613 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Under the first and second prongs, RLUIPA&#x97;and, indeed, any accommodation of religion&#x97;might well violate the Clause.  Even laws disestablishing religion might violate the Clause.  Disestablishment might easily have a religious purpose and thereby flunk the first prong, or it might well &#x93;strengthen and revitalize&#x94; religion and so fail the second.  McConnell, Establishment and Disestablishment at the Founding, Part I: Establishment of Religion, 44 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 2105, 2206&#x96;2207 (2003) (hereinafter McConnell).

						 The Court dismisses the parties&#x92; arguments about the federalism aspect of the Clause with the brief observation that the Court of Appeals did not address the issue.  Ante, at 7&#x96;8, n. 7.  The parties&#x92; contentions on this point, however, are fairly included in the question presented, which asks &#x93;[w]hether Congress violated the Establishment Clause by enacting [RLUIPA].&#x94;  Pet. for Cert. i.  Further, both parties have briefed the federalism understanding of the Clause, Brief for Respondents 25&#x96;33; Reply Brief for Petitioners 12&#x96;16, and neither suggests that a remand on it would be useful or that the record in this Court lacks relevant facts, Good News Club v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">9</a> (2001)

Also, though RLUIPA is entirely consonant with the Establishment Clause, it may well exceed Congress&#x92; authority under either the Spending Clause or the Commerce Clause. See Sabri v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/600" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 600</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">613</a> (2004)
 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (for a spending clause condition on a State&#x92;s receipt of funds to be &#x93;Necessary and Proper&#x94; to the expenditure of the funds, there must be &#x93;some obvious, simple, and direct relation&#x94; between the condition and the expenditure of the funds); United States v. Lopez, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/549" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 549</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">587</a> (1995)
 (Thomas, J., concurring) (&#x93;The Constitution not only uses the word &#x91;commerce&#x92; in a narrower sense than our case law might suggest, it also does not support the proposition that Congress has authority over all activities that &#x91;substantially affect&#x92; interstate commerce&#x94;).  The Court, however, properly declines to reach those issues, since they are outside the question presented and were not addressed by the Court of Appeals.

Justice Story did say that &#x93;the whole power over the subject of religion is left exclusively to the state governments, to be acted upon according to their own sense of justice, and the state constitutions.&#x94;  Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 702&#x96;703 (1833) (reprinted 1987).

				In short, the view that the Establishment Clause precludes Congress from legislating respecting religion lacks historical provenance, at least based on the history of which I am aware.  Even when enacting laws that bind the States pursuant to valid exercises of its enumerated powers, Congress need not observe strict separation between church and state, or steer clear of the subject of religion.  It need only refrain from making laws &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion&#x94;; it must not interfere with a state establishment of religion.  For example, Congress presumably could not require a State to establish a religion any more than it could preclude a State from establishing a religion.

				On its face&#x97;the relevant inquiry, as this is a facial challenge&#x97;RLUIPA is not a law &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion.&#x94;  RLUIPA provides, as relevant: &#x93;No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, &#x2026; even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,&#x94; first, &#x93;further[s] a compelling governmental interest,&#x94; and second, &#x93;is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-1.html#a_1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(a)(1)</a>&#x96;(2).  This provision does not prohibit or interfere with state establishments, since no State has established (or constitutionally could establish, given an incorporated Clause) a religion.  Nor does the provision require a State to establish a religion: It does not force a State to coerce religious observance or payment of taxes supporting clergy, or require a State to prefer one religious sect over another.  It is a law respecting religion, but not one respecting an establishment of religion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In addition, RLUIPA&#x92;s text applies to all laws passed by state and local governments, including &#x93;rule[s] of general applicability,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, whether or not they concern an establishment of religion.  State and local governments obviously have many laws that have nothing to do with religion, let alone establishments thereof.  Numerous applications of RLUIPA therefore do not contravene the Establishment Clause, and a facial challenge based on the Clause must fail.  See

				It also bears noting that Congress, pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, conditioned the States&#x92; receipt of federal funds on their compliance with RLUIPA.  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(b)(1) (&#x93;This section applies in any case in which &#x2026; the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance&#x94;).  As noted above, n. 2, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, RLUIPA may well exceed the spending power.  Nonetheless, while Congress&#x92; condition stands, the States subject themselves to that condition by voluntarily accepting federal funds.  The States&#x92; voluntary acceptance of Congress&#x92; condition undercuts Ohio&#x92;s argument that Congress is encroaching on its turf.

						 The Court properly declines to assess RLUIPA under the discredited test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/602" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 602</a> (1971)
, which the Court of Appeals applied below, 349 F. 3d 257, 262&#x96;268 (CA6 2003).  Lemon held that, to avoid invalidation under the Establishment Clause, a statute &#x93;must have a secular legislative purpose,&#x94; &#x93;its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion,&#x94; and it &#x93;must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.&#x94;  403 U. S., at 612&#x96;613 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Under the first and second prongs, RLUIPA&#x97;and, indeed, any accommodation of religion&#x97;might well violate the Clause.  Even laws disestablishing religion might violate the Clause.  Disestablishment might easily have a religious purpose and thereby flunk the first prong, or it might well &#x93;strengthen and revitalize&#x94; religion and so fail the second.  McConnell, Establishment and Disestablishment at the Founding, Part I: Establishment of Religion, 44 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 2105, 2206&#x96;2207 (2003) (hereinafter McConnell).

						 The Court dismisses the parties&#x92; arguments about the federalism aspect of the Clause with the brief observation that the Court of Appeals did not address the issue.  Ante, at 7&#x96;8, n. 7.  The parties&#x92; contentions on this point, however, are fairly included in the question presented, which asks &#x93;[w]hether Congress violated the Establishment Clause by enacting [RLUIPA].&#x94;  Pet. for Cert. i.  Further, both parties have briefed the federalism understanding of the Clause, Brief for Respondents 25&#x96;33; Reply Brief for Petitioners 12&#x96;16, and neither suggests that a remand on it would be useful or that the record in this Court lacks relevant facts, Good News Club v. Milford Central School,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">9</a> (2001)
.


Also, though RLUIPA is entirely consonant with the Establishment Clause, it may well exceed Congress&#x92; authority under either the Spending Clause or the Commerce Clause. See Sabri v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/600" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 600</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">613</a> (2004)
 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (for a spending clause condition on a State&#x92;s receipt of funds to be &#x93;Necessary and Proper&#x94; to the expenditure of the funds, there must be &#x93;some obvious, simple, and direct relation&#x94; between the condition and the expenditure of the funds); United States v. Lopez, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/549" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 549</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">587</a> (1995)
 (Thomas, J., concurring) (&#x93;The Constitution not only uses the word &#x91;commerce&#x92; in a narrower sense than our case law might suggest, it also does not support the proposition that Congress has authority over all activities that &#x91;substantially affect&#x92; interstate commerce&#x94;).  The Court, however, properly declines to reach those issues, since they are outside the question presented and were not addressed by the Court of Appeals.

				The Establishment Clause provides that &#x93;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.&#x94;  Amdt. 1.  As I have explained, an important function of the Clause was to &#x93;ma[ke] clear that Congress could not interfere with state establishments.&#x94;

				History, at least that presented by Ohio, does not show that the Clause hermetically seals the Federal Government out of the field of religion.  Ohio points to, among other things, the words of James Madison in defense of the Constitution at the Virginia Ratifying Convention: &#x93;There is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion.  Its least interference with it would be a most flagrant usurpation.&#x94;  General Defense of the Constitution (June 12, 1788), reprinted in 11 Papers of James Madison 130 (R. Rutland, C. Hobson, W. Rachal, &amp; J. Sisson eds. 1977).  Ohio also relies on James Iredell&#x92;s statement discussing the Religious Test Clause at the North Carolina Ratifying Convention: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[Congress] certainly [has] no authority to interfere in the establishment of any religion whatsoever &#x2026; .  Is there any power given to Congress in matters of religion?  Can they pass a single act to impair our religious liberties?  If they could, it would be a just cause of alarm &#x2026; .  If any future Congress should pass an act concerning the religion of the country, it would be an act which they are not authorized to pass, by the Constitution, and which the people would not obey.&#x94;  Debate in North Carolina Ratifying Convention (June 30, 1788), in 5 Founders&#x92; Constitution 90 (P.

				These quotations do not establish the Framers&#x92; beliefs about the scope of the Establishment Clause.  Instead, they demonstrate only that some of the Framers may have believed that the National Government had no authority to legislate concerning religion, because no enumerated power gave it that authority.

				In short, the view that the Establishment Clause precludes Congress from legislating respecting religion lacks historical provenance, at least based on the history of which I am aware.  Even when enacting laws that bind the States pursuant to valid exercises of its enumerated powers, Congress need not observe strict separation between church and state, or steer clear of the subject of religion.  It need only refrain from making laws &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion&#x94;; it must not interfere with a state establishment of religion.  For example, Congress presumably could not require a State to establish a religion any more than it could preclude a State from establishing a religion.

				On its face&#x97;the relevant inquiry, as this is a facial challenge&#x97;RLUIPA is not a law &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion.&#x94;  RLUIPA provides, as relevant: &#x93;No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, &#x2026; even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,&#x94; first, &#x93;further[s] a compelling governmental interest,&#x94; and second, &#x93;is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.&#x94;

This provision does not prohibit or interfere with state establishments, since no State has established (or constitutionally could establish, given an incorporated Clause) a religion.  Nor does the provision require a State to establish a religion: It does not force a State to coerce religious observance or payment of taxes supporting clergy, or require a State to prefer one religious sect over another.  It is a law respecting religion, but not one respecting an establishment of religion.

				In addition, RLUIPA&#x92;s text applies to all laws passed by state and local governments, including &#x93;rule[s] of general applicability,&#x94; 
				<em>

				, whether or not they concern an establishment of religion.  State and local governments obviously have many laws that have nothing to do with religion, let alone establishments thereof.  Numerous applications of RLUIPA therefore do not contravene the Establishment Clause, and a facial challenge based on the Clause must fail.  See

				It also bears noting that Congress, pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, conditioned the States&#x92; receipt of federal funds on their compliance with RLUIPA.  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(b)(1) (&#x93;This section applies in any case in which &#x2026; the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance&#x94;).  As noted above, n. 2, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, RLUIPA may well exceed the spending power.  Nonetheless, while Congress&#x92; condition stands, the States subject themselves to that condition by voluntarily accepting federal funds.  The States&#x92; voluntary acceptance of Congress&#x92; condition undercuts Ohio&#x92;s argument that Congress is encroaching on its turf.

						 The Court properly declines to assess RLUIPA under the discredited test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/602" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 602</a> (1971)
, which the Court of Appeals applied below, 349 F. 3d 257, 262&#x96;268 (CA6 2003).  Lemon held that, to avoid invalidation under the Establishment Clause, a statute &#x93;must have a secular legislative purpose,&#x94; &#x93;its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion,&#x94; and it &#x93;must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.&#x94;  403 U. S., at 612&#x96;613 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Under the first and second prongs, RLUIPA&#x97;and, indeed, any accommodation of religion&#x97;might well violate the Clause.  Even laws disestablishing religion might violate the Clause.  Disestablishment might easily have a religious purpose and thereby flunk the first prong, or it might well &#x93;strengthen and revitalize&#x94; religion and so fail the second.  McConnell, Establishment and Disestablishment at the Founding, Part I: Establishment of Religion, 44 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 2105, 2206&#x96;2207 (2003) (hereinafter McConnell).

						 The Court dismisses the parties&#x92; arguments about the federalism aspect of the Clause with the brief observation that the Court of Appeals did not address the issue.  Ante, at 7&#x96;8, n. 7.  The parties&#x92; contentions on this point, however, are fairly included in the question presented, which asks &#x93;[w]hether Congress violated the Establishment Clause by enacting [RLUIPA].&#x94;  Pet. for Cert. i.  Further, both parties have briefed the federalism understanding of the Clause, Brief for Respondents 25&#x96;33; Reply Brief for Petitioners 12&#x96;16, and neither suggests that a remand on it would be useful or that the record in this Court lacks relevant facts, Good News Club v.

Also, though RLUIPA is entirely consonant with the Establishment Clause, it may well exceed Congress&#x92; authority under either the Spending Clause or the Commerce Clause. See Sabri v. United States,

 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (for a spending clause condition on a State&#x92;s receipt of funds to be &#x93;Necessary and Proper&#x94; to the expenditure of the funds, there must be &#x93;some obvious, simple, and direct relation&#x94; between the condition and the expenditure of the funds); United States v. Lopez,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">587</a> (1995)
 (Thomas, J., concurring) (&#x93;The Constitution not only uses the word &#x91;commerce&#x92; in a narrower sense than our case law might suggest, it also does not support the proposition that Congress has authority over all activities that &#x91;substantially affect&#x92; interstate commerce&#x94;).  The Court, however, properly declines to reach those issues, since they are outside the question presented and were not addressed by the Court of Appeals.

				The Establishment Clause provides that &#x93;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.&#x94;  Amdt. 1.  As I have explained, an important function of the Clause was to &#x93;ma[ke] clear that Congress could not interfere with state establishments.&#x94;

				History, at least that presented by Ohio, does not show that the Clause hermetically seals the Federal Government out of the field of religion.  Ohio points to, among other things, the words of James Madison in defense of the Constitution at the Virginia Ratifying Convention: &#x93;There is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion.  Its least interference with it would be a most flagrant usurpation.&#x94;  General Defense of the Constitution (June 12, 1788), reprinted in 11 Papers of James Madison 130 (R. Rutland, C. Hobson, W. Rachal, &amp; J. Sisson eds. 1977).  Ohio also relies on James Iredell&#x92;s statement discussing the Religious Test Clause at the North Carolina Ratifying Convention: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[Congress] certainly [has] no authority to interfere in the establishment of any religion whatsoever &#x2026; .  Is there any power given to Congress in matters of religion?  Can they pass a single act to impair our religious liberties?  If they could, it would be a just cause of alarm &#x2026; .  If any future Congress should pass an act concerning the religion of the country, it would be an act which they are not authorized to pass, by the Constitution, and which the people would not obey.&#x94;  Debate in North Carolina Ratifying Convention (June 30, 1788), in 5 Founders&#x92; Constitution 90 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				These quotations do not establish the Framers&#x92; beliefs about the scope of the Establishment Clause.  Instead, they demonstrate only that some of the Framers may have believed that the National Government had no authority to legislate concerning religion, because no enumerated power gave it that authority.  Ohio&#x92;s Spending Clause and Commerce Clause challenges, therefore, may well have merit.  See n. 2,

				In any event, Ohio has not shown that the Establishment Clause codified Madison&#x92;s or Iredell&#x92;s view that the Federal Government could not legislate regarding religion.  An

				It also bears noting that Congress, pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, conditioned the States&#x92; receipt of federal funds on their compliance with RLUIPA.  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(b)(1) (&#x93;This section applies in any case in which &#x2026; the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance&#x94;).  As noted above, n. 2,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/602" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 602</a> (1971)
, which the Court of Appeals applied below, 349 F. 3d 257, 262&#x96;268 (CA6 2003).  Lemon held that, to avoid invalidation under the Establishment Clause, a statute &#x93;must have a secular legislative purpose,&#x94; &#x93;its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion,&#x94; and it &#x93;must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.&#x94;  403 U.

Even laws disestablishing religion might violate the Clause.  Disestablishment might easily have a religious purpose and thereby flunk the first prong, or it might well &#x93;strengthen and revitalize&#x94; religion and so fail the second.

						 The Court dismisses the parties&#x92; arguments about the federalism aspect of the Clause with the brief observation that the Court of Appeals did not address the issue.  Ante, at 7&#x96;8, n. 7.  The parties&#x92; contentions on this point, however, are fairly included in the question presented, which asks &#x93;[w]hether Congress violated the Establishment Clause by enacting [RLUIPA].&#x94;  Pet. for Cert. i.  Further, both parties have briefed the federalism understanding of the Clause, Brief for Respondents 25&#x96;33; Reply Brief for Petitioners 12&#x96;16, and neither suggests that a remand on it would be useful or that the record in this Court lacks relevant facts, Good News Club v.

Also, though RLUIPA is entirely consonant with the Establishment Clause, it may well exceed Congress&#x92; authority under either the Spending Clause or the Commerce Clause. See Sabri v. United States,

 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (for a spending clause condition on a State&#x92;s receipt of funds to be &#x93;Necessary and Proper&#x94; to the expenditure of the funds, there must be &#x93;some obvious, simple, and direct relation&#x94; between the condition and the expenditure of the funds); United States v.

 (Thomas, J., concurring) (&#x93;The Constitution not only uses the word &#x91;commerce&#x92; in a narrower sense than our case law might suggest, it also does not support the proposition that Congress has authority over all activities that &#x91;substantially affect&#x92; interstate commerce&#x94;).  The Court, however, properly declines to reach those issues, since they are outside the question presented and were not addressed by the Court of Appeals.

				The Establishment Clause provides that &#x93;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.&#x94;  Amdt. 1.  As I have explained, an important function of the Clause was to &#x93;ma[ke] clear that Congress could not interfere with state establishments.&#x94;

				History, at least that presented by Ohio, does not show that the Clause hermetically seals the Federal Government out of the field of religion.  Ohio points to, among other things, the words of James Madison in defense of the Constitution at the Virginia Ratifying Convention: &#x93;There is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion.  Its least interference with it would be a most flagrant usurpation.&#x94;  General Defense of the Constitution (June 12, 1788), reprinted in 11 Papers of James Madison 130 (R. Rutland, C. Hobson, W. Rachal, &amp; J. Sisson eds. 1977).  Ohio also relies on James Iredell&#x92;s statement discussing the Religious Test Clause at the North Carolina Ratifying Convention: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[Congress] certainly [has] no authority to interfere in the establishment of any religion whatsoever &#x2026; .  Is there any power given to Congress in matters of religion?  Can they pass a single act to impair our religious liberties?  If they could, it would be a just cause of alarm &#x2026; .  If any future Congress should pass an act concerning the religion of the country, it would be an act which they are not authorized to pass, by the Constitution, and which the people would not obey.&#x94;  Debate in North Carolina Ratifying Convention (June 30, 1788), in 5 Founders&#x92; Constitution 90 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				These quotations do not establish the Framers&#x92; beliefs about the scope of the Establishment Clause.  Instead, they demonstrate only that some of the Framers may have believed that the National Government had no authority to legislate concerning religion, because no enumerated power gave it that authority.  Ohio&#x92;s Spending Clause and Commerce Clause challenges, therefore, may well have merit.  See n. 2, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In any event, Ohio has not shown that the Establishment Clause codified Madison&#x92;s or Iredell&#x92;s view that the Federal Government could not legislate regarding religion.  An 
				<em>
					unenacted
				</em>
				 version of the Clause, proposed in the House of Representatives, demonstrates the opposite.  It provided that &#x93;Congress shall make no laws touching religion, or infringing the rights of conscience.&#x94;  1 Annals of Cong. 731 (1789); see also

Justice Story did say that &#x93;the whole power over the subject of religion is left exclusively to the state governments, to be acted upon according to their own sense of justice, and the state constitutions.&#x94;  Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 702&#x96;703 (1833) (reprinted 1987).  In context, however, his statement concerned only Congress&#x92; inability to legislate with respect to religious 
				<em>
					establishment
				</em>
				.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 701 (&#x93;The real object of the amendment was &#x2026; to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment, which should give to an hierarchy the exclusive patronage of the national government&#x94;);

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In short, the view that the Establishment Clause precludes Congress from legislating respecting religion lacks historical provenance, at least based on the history of which I am aware.  Even when enacting laws that bind the States pursuant to valid exercises of its enumerated powers, Congress need not observe strict separation between church and state, or steer clear of the subject of religion.  It need only refrain from making laws &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion&#x94;; it must not interfere with a state establishment of religion.  For example, Congress presumably could not require a State to establish a religion any more than it could preclude a State from establishing a religion.

				On its face&#x97;the relevant inquiry, as this is a facial challenge&#x97;RLUIPA is not a law &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion.&#x94;  RLUIPA provides, as relevant: &#x93;No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, &#x2026; even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,&#x94; first, &#x93;further[s] a compelling governmental interest,&#x94; and second, &#x93;is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.&#x94;

This provision does not prohibit or interfere with state establishments, since no State has established (or constitutionally could establish, given an incorporated Clause) a religion.  Nor does the provision require a State to establish a religion: It does not force a State to coerce religious observance or payment of taxes supporting clergy, or require a State to prefer one religious sect over another.  It is a law respecting religion, but not one respecting an establishment of religion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In addition, RLUIPA&#x92;s text applies to all laws passed by state and local governments, including &#x93;rule[s] of general applicability,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, whether or not they concern an establishment of religion.  State and local governments obviously have many laws that have nothing to do with religion, let alone establishments thereof.  Numerous applications of RLUIPA therefore do not contravene the Establishment Clause, and a facial challenge based on the Clause must fail.  See

				It also bears noting that Congress, pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, conditioned the States&#x92; receipt of federal funds on their compliance with RLUIPA.  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(b)(1) (&#x93;This section applies in any case in which &#x2026; the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance&#x94;).

Even laws disestablishing religion might violate the Clause.  Disestablishment might easily have a religious purpose and thereby flunk the first prong, or it might well &#x93;strengthen and revitalize&#x94; religion and so fail the second.

				History, at least that presented by Ohio, does not show that the Clause hermetically seals the Federal Government out of the field of religion.  Ohio points to, among other things, the words of James Madison in defense of the Constitution at the Virginia Ratifying Convention: &#x93;There is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion.  Its least interference with it would be a most flagrant usurpation.&#x94;  General Defense of the Constitution (June 12, 1788), reprinted in 11 Papers of James Madison 130 (R. Rutland, C. Hobson, W. Rachal, &amp; J. Sisson eds. 1977).  Ohio also relies on James Iredell&#x92;s statement discussing the Religious Test Clause at the North Carolina Ratifying Convention: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[Congress] certainly [has] no authority to interfere in the establishment of any religion whatsoever &#x2026; .  Is there any power given to Congress in matters of religion?  Can they pass a single act to impair our religious liberties?  If they could, it would be a just cause of alarm &#x2026; .  If any future Congress should pass an act concerning the religion of the country, it would be an act which they are not authorized to pass, by the Constitution, and which the people would not obey.&#x94;  Debate in North Carolina Ratifying Convention (June 30, 1788), in 5 Founders&#x92; Constitution 90 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				These quotations do not establish the Framers&#x92; beliefs about the scope of the Establishment Clause.  Instead, they demonstrate only that some of the Framers may have believed that the National Government had no authority to legislate concerning religion, because no enumerated power gave it that authority.  Ohio&#x92;s Spending Clause and Commerce Clause challenges, therefore, may well have merit.  See n. 2, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In any event, Ohio has not shown that the Establishment Clause codified Madison&#x92;s or Iredell&#x92;s view that the Federal Government could not legislate regarding religion.  An 
				<em>
					unenacted
				</em>
				 version of the Clause, proposed in the House of Representatives, demonstrates the opposite.  It provided that &#x93;Congress shall make no laws touching religion, or infringing the rights of conscience.&#x94;  1 Annals of Cong. 731 (1789); see also

Justice Story did say that &#x93;the whole power over the subject of religion is left exclusively to the state governments, to be acted upon according to their own sense of justice, and the state constitutions.&#x94;  Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 702&#x96;703 (1833) (reprinted 1987).  In context, however, his statement concerned only Congress&#x92; inability to legislate with respect to religious 
				<em>
					establishment
				</em>
				.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 701 (&#x93;The real object of the amendment was &#x2026; to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment, which should give to an hierarchy the exclusive patronage of the national government&#x94;);

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In short, the view that the Establishment Clause precludes Congress from legislating respecting religion lacks historical provenance, at least based on the history of which I am aware.  Even when enacting laws that bind the States pursuant to valid exercises of its enumerated powers, Congress need not observe strict separation between church and state, or steer clear of the subject of religion.  It need only refrain from making laws &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion&#x94;; it must not interfere with a state establishment of religion.  For example, Congress presumably could not require a State to establish a religion any more than it could preclude a State from establishing a religion.

				On its face&#x97;the relevant inquiry, as this is a facial challenge&#x97;RLUIPA is not a law &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion.&#x94;  RLUIPA provides, as relevant: &#x93;No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, &#x2026; even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,&#x94; first, &#x93;further[s] a compelling governmental interest,&#x94; and second, &#x93;is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-1.html#a_1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(a)(1)</a>&#x96;(2).  This provision does not prohibit or interfere with state establishments, since no State has established (or constitutionally could establish, given an incorporated Clause) a religion.  Nor does the provision require a State to establish a religion: It does not force a State to coerce religious observance or payment of taxes supporting clergy, or require a State to prefer one religious sect over another.  It is a law respecting religion, but not one respecting an establishment of religion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In addition, RLUIPA&#x92;s text applies to all laws passed by state and local governments, including &#x93;rule[s] of general applicability,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, whether or not they concern an establishment of religion.  State and local governments obviously have many laws that have nothing to do with religion, let alone establishments thereof.  Numerous applications of RLUIPA therefore do not contravene the Establishment Clause, and a facial challenge based on the Clause must fail.  See

				It also bears noting that Congress, pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, conditioned the States&#x92; receipt of federal funds on their compliance with RLUIPA.  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(b)(1) (&#x93;This section applies in any case in which &#x2026; the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance&#x94;).  As noted above, n. 2, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, RLUIPA may well exceed the spending power.  Nonetheless, while Congress&#x92; condition stands, the States subject themselves to that condition by voluntarily accepting federal funds.  The States&#x92; voluntary acceptance of Congress&#x92; condition undercuts Ohio&#x92;s argument that Congress is encroaching on its turf.

				History, at least that presented by Ohio, does not show that the Clause hermetically seals the Federal Government out of the field of religion.  Ohio points to, among other things, the words of James Madison in defense of the Constitution at the Virginia Ratifying Convention: &#x93;There is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion.  Its least interference with it would be a most flagrant usurpation.&#x94;  General Defense of the Constitution (June 12, 1788), reprinted in 11 Papers of James Madison 130 (R. Rutland, C. Hobson, W. Rachal, &amp; J. Sisson eds. 1977).  Ohio also relies on James Iredell&#x92;s statement discussing the Religious Test Clause at the North Carolina Ratifying Convention: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[Congress] certainly [has] no authority to interfere in the establishment of any religion whatsoever &#x2026; .  Is there any power given to Congress in matters of religion?  Can they pass a single act to impair our religious liberties?  If they could, it would be a just cause of alarm &#x2026; .  If any future Congress should pass an act concerning the religion of the country, it would be an act which they are not authorized to pass, by the Constitution, and which the people would not obey.&#x94;  Debate in North Carolina Ratifying Convention (June 30, 1788), in 5 Founders&#x92; Constitution 90 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				These quotations do not establish the Framers&#x92; beliefs about the scope of the Establishment Clause.  Instead, they demonstrate only that some of the Framers may have believed that the National Government had no authority to legislate concerning religion, because no enumerated power gave it that authority.  Ohio&#x92;s Spending Clause and Commerce Clause challenges, therefore, may well have merit.  See n. 2, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In any event, Ohio has not shown that the Establishment Clause codified Madison&#x92;s or Iredell&#x92;s view that the Federal Government could not legislate regarding religion.  An 
				<em>
					unenacted
				</em>
				 version of the Clause, proposed in the House of Representatives, demonstrates the opposite.  It provided that &#x93;Congress shall make no laws touching religion, or infringing the rights of conscience.&#x94;  1 Annals of Cong. 731 (1789); see also

Justice Story did say that &#x93;the whole power over the subject of religion is left exclusively to the state governments, to be acted upon according to their own sense of justice, and the state constitutions.&#x94;  Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 702&#x96;703 (1833) (reprinted 1987).  In context, however, his statement concerned only Congress&#x92; inability to legislate with respect to religious 
				<em>
					establishment
				</em>
				.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 701 (&#x93;The real object of the amendment was &#x2026; to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment, which should give to an hierarchy the exclusive patronage of the national government&#x94;); 
				<em>

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In short, the view that the Establishment Clause precludes Congress from legislating respecting religion lacks historical provenance, at least based on the history of which I am aware.  Even when enacting laws that bind the States pursuant to valid exercises of its enumerated powers, Congress need not observe strict separation between church and state, or steer clear of the subject of religion.  It need only refrain from making laws &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion&#x94;; it must not interfere with a state establishment of religion.  For example, Congress presumably could not require a State to establish a religion any more than it could preclude a State from establishing a religion.

				On its face&#x97;the relevant inquiry, as this is a facial challenge&#x97;RLUIPA is not a law &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion.&#x94;  RLUIPA provides, as relevant: &#x93;No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, &#x2026; even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,&#x94; first, &#x93;further[s] a compelling governmental interest,&#x94; and second, &#x93;is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-1.html#a_1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(a)(1)</a>&#x96;(2).  This provision does not prohibit or interfere with state establishments, since no State has established (or constitutionally could establish, given an incorporated Clause) a religion.  Nor does the provision require a State to establish a religion: It does not force a State to coerce religious observance or payment of taxes supporting clergy, or require a State to prefer one religious sect over another.  It is a law respecting religion, but not one respecting an establishment of religion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In addition, RLUIPA&#x92;s text applies to all laws passed by state and local governments, including &#x93;rule[s] of general applicability,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, whether or not they concern an establishment of religion.  State and local governments obviously have many laws that have nothing to do with religion, let alone establishments thereof.  Numerous applications of RLUIPA therefore do not contravene the Establishment Clause, and a facial challenge based on the Clause must fail.  See

				It also bears noting that Congress, pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, conditioned the States&#x92; receipt of federal funds on their compliance with RLUIPA.  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(b)(1) (&#x93;This section applies in any case in which &#x2026; the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance&#x94;).  As noted above, n. 2, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, RLUIPA may well exceed the spending power.  Nonetheless, while Congress&#x92; condition stands, the States subject themselves to that condition by voluntarily accepting federal funds.  The States&#x92; voluntary acceptance of Congress&#x92; condition undercuts Ohio&#x92;s argument that Congress is encroaching on its turf.

						 The Court properly declines to assess RLUIPA under the discredited test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/602" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 602</a> (1971)
, which the Court of Appeals applied below, 349 F. 3d 257, 262&#x96;268 (CA6 2003).  Lemon held that, to avoid invalidation under the Establishment Clause, a statute &#x93;must have a secular legislative purpose,&#x94; &#x93;its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion,&#x94; and it &#x93;must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.&#x94;  403 U. S., at 612&#x96;613 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Under the first and second prongs, RLUIPA&#x97;and, indeed, any accommodation of religion&#x97;might well violate the Clause.  Even laws disestablishing religion might violate the Clause.  Disestablishment might easily have a religious purpose and thereby flunk the first prong, or it might well &#x93;strengthen and revitalize&#x94; religion and so fail the second.

						 The Court dismisses the parties&#x92; arguments about the federalism aspect of the Clause with the brief observation that the Court of Appeals did not address the issue.  Ante, at 7&#x96;8, n. 7.  The parties&#x92; contentions on this point, however, are fairly included in the question presented, which asks &#x93;[w]hether Congress violated the Establishment Clause by enacting [RLUIPA].&#x94;  Pet. for Cert. i.  Further, both parties have briefed the federalism understanding of the Clause, Brief for Respondents 25&#x96;33; Reply Brief for Petitioners 12&#x96;16, and neither suggests that a remand on it would be useful or that the record in this Court lacks relevant facts, Good News Club v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">9</a> (2001)

Also, though RLUIPA is entirely consonant with the Establishment Clause, it may well exceed Congress&#x92; authority under either the Spending Clause or the Commerce Clause. See Sabri v. United States,

 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (for a spending clause condition on a State&#x92;s receipt of funds to be &#x93;Necessary and Proper&#x94; to the expenditure of the funds, there must be &#x93;some obvious, simple, and direct relation&#x94; between the condition and the expenditure of the funds); United States v. Lopez,

 (Thomas, J., concurring) (&#x93;The Constitution not only uses the word &#x91;commerce&#x92; in a narrower sense than our case law might suggest, it also does not support the proposition that Congress has authority over all activities that &#x91;substantially affect&#x92; interstate commerce&#x94;).  The Court, however, properly declines to reach those issues, since they are outside the question presented and were not addressed by the Court of Appeals.

				History, at least that presented by Ohio, does not show that the Clause hermetically seals the Federal Government out of the field of religion.  Ohio points to, among other things, the words of James Madison in defense of the Constitution at the Virginia Ratifying Convention: &#x93;There is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion.  Its least interference with it would be a most flagrant usurpation.&#x94;  General Defense of the Constitution (June 12, 1788), reprinted in 11 Papers of James Madison 130 (R. Rutland, C. Hobson, W. Rachal, &amp; J. Sisson eds. 1977).  Ohio also relies on James Iredell&#x92;s statement discussing the Religious Test Clause at the North Carolina Ratifying Convention: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[Congress] certainly [has] no authority to interfere in the establishment of any religion whatsoever &#x2026; .  Is there any power given to Congress in matters of religion?  Can they pass a single act to impair our religious liberties?  If they could, it would be a just cause of alarm &#x2026; .  If any future Congress should pass an act concerning the religion of the country, it would be an act which they are not authorized to pass, by the Constitution, and which the people would not obey.&#x94;  Debate in North Carolina Ratifying Convention (June 30, 1788), in 5 Founders&#x92; Constitution 90 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987). 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				These quotations do not establish the Framers&#x92; beliefs about the scope of the Establishment Clause.  Instead, they demonstrate only that some of the Framers may have believed that the National Government had no authority to legislate concerning religion, because no enumerated power gave it that authority.  Ohio&#x92;s Spending Clause and Commerce Clause challenges, therefore, may well have merit.  See n. 2, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In any event, Ohio has not shown that the Establishment Clause codified Madison&#x92;s or Iredell&#x92;s view that the Federal Government could not legislate regarding religion.  An 
				<em>
					unenacted
				</em>
				 version of the Clause, proposed in the House of Representatives, demonstrates the opposite.  It provided that &#x93;Congress shall make no laws touching religion, or infringing the rights of conscience.&#x94;  1 Annals of Cong. 731 (1789); see also

Justice Story did say that &#x93;the whole power over the subject of religion is left exclusively to the state governments, to be acted upon according to their own sense of justice, and the state constitutions.&#x94;  Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 702&#x96;703 (1833) (reprinted 1987).  In context, however, his statement concerned only Congress&#x92; inability to legislate with respect to religious 
				<em>
					establishment
				</em>
				.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 701 (&#x93;The real object of the amendment was &#x2026; to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment, which should give to an hierarchy the exclusive patronage of the national government&#x94;); 
				<em>

				 at 702 (&#x93;[I]t was deemed advisable to exclude from the national government all power to act upon the subject &#x2026; . It was impossible, that there should not arise perpetual strife and perpetual jealousy on the subject of ecclesiastical ascendancy, if the national government were left free to create a religious establishment&#x94;).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In short, the view that the Establishment Clause precludes Congress from legislating respecting religion lacks historical provenance, at least based on the history of which I am aware.  Even when enacting laws that bind the States pursuant to valid exercises of its enumerated powers, Congress need not observe strict separation between church and state, or steer clear of the subject of religion.  It need only refrain from making laws &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion&#x94;; it must not interfere with a state establishment of religion.  For example, Congress presumably could not require a State to establish a religion any more than it could preclude a State from establishing a religion.

				On its face&#x97;the relevant inquiry, as this is a facial challenge&#x97;RLUIPA is not a law &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion.&#x94;  RLUIPA provides, as relevant: &#x93;No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, &#x2026; even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,&#x94; first, &#x93;further[s] a compelling governmental interest,&#x94; and second, &#x93;is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-1.html#a_1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(a)(1)</a>&#x96;(2).  This provision does not prohibit or interfere with state establishments, since no State has established (or constitutionally could establish, given an incorporated Clause) a religion.  Nor does the provision require a State to establish a religion: It does not force a State to coerce religious observance or payment of taxes supporting clergy, or require a State to prefer one religious sect over another.  It is a law respecting religion, but not one respecting an establishment of religion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In addition, RLUIPA&#x92;s text applies to all laws passed by state and local governments, including &#x93;rule[s] of general applicability,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, whether or not they concern an establishment of religion.  State and local governments obviously have many laws that have nothing to do with religion, let alone establishments thereof.  Numerous applications of RLUIPA therefore do not contravene the Establishment Clause, and a facial challenge based on the Clause must fail.  See

				It also bears noting that Congress, pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, conditioned the States&#x92; receipt of federal funds on their compliance with RLUIPA.  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(b)(1) (&#x93;This section applies in any case in which &#x2026; the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance&#x94;).  As noted above, n. 2, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, RLUIPA may well exceed the spending power.  Nonetheless, while Congress&#x92; condition stands, the States subject themselves to that condition by voluntarily accepting federal funds.  The States&#x92; voluntary acceptance of Congress&#x92; condition undercuts Ohio&#x92;s argument that Congress is encroaching on its turf.

						 The Court properly declines to assess RLUIPA under the discredited test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/602" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 602</a> (1971)
, which the Court of Appeals applied below, 349 F. 3d 257, 262&#x96;268 (CA6 2003).  Lemon held that, to avoid invalidation under the Establishment Clause, a statute &#x93;must have a secular legislative purpose,&#x94; &#x93;its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion,&#x94; and it &#x93;must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.&#x94;  403 U. S., at 612&#x96;613 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Under the first and second prongs, RLUIPA&#x97;and, indeed, any accommodation of religion&#x97;might well violate the Clause.  Even laws disestablishing religion might violate the Clause.  Disestablishment might easily have a religious purpose and thereby flunk the first prong, or it might well &#x93;strengthen and revitalize&#x94; religion and so fail the second.  McConnell, Establishment and Disestablishment at the Founding, Part I: Establishment of Religion, 44 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 2105, 2206&#x96;2207 (2003) (hereinafter McConnell).

						 The Court dismisses the parties&#x92; arguments about the federalism aspect of the Clause with the brief observation that the Court of Appeals did not address the issue.  Ante, at 7&#x96;8, n. 7.  The parties&#x92; contentions on this point, however, are fairly included in the question presented, which asks &#x93;[w]hether Congress violated the Establishment Clause by enacting [RLUIPA].&#x94;  Pet. for Cert. i.  Further, both parties have briefed the federalism understanding of the Clause, Brief for Respondents 25&#x96;33; Reply Brief for Petitioners 12&#x96;16, and neither suggests that a remand on it would be useful or that the record in this Court lacks relevant facts, Good News Club v. Milford Central School,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">9</a> (2001)
.


Also, though RLUIPA is entirely consonant with the Establishment Clause, it may well exceed Congress&#x92; authority under either the Spending Clause or the Commerce Clause. See Sabri v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/600" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 600</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">613</a> (2004)
 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (for a spending clause condition on a State&#x92;s receipt of funds to be &#x93;Necessary and Proper&#x94; to the expenditure of the funds, there must be &#x93;some obvious, simple, and direct relation&#x94; between the condition and the expenditure of the funds); United States v. Lopez, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/549" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 549</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">587</a> (1995)
 (Thomas, J., concurring) (&#x93;The Constitution not only uses the word &#x91;commerce&#x92; in a narrower sense than our case law might suggest, it also does not support the proposition that Congress has authority over all activities that &#x91;substantially affect&#x92; interstate commerce&#x94;).  The Court, however, properly declines to reach those issues, since they are outside the question presented and were not addressed by the Court of Appeals.

				History, at least that presented by Ohio, does not show that the Clause hermetically seals the Federal Government out of the field of religion.  Ohio points to, among other things, the words of James Madison in defense of the Constitution at the Virginia Ratifying Convention: &#x93;There is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion.  Its least interference with it would be a most flagrant usurpation.&#x94;  General Defense of the Constitution (June 12, 1788), reprinted in 11 Papers of James Madison 130 (R. Rutland, C. Hobson, W. Rachal, &amp; J. Sisson eds. 1977).  Ohio also relies on James Iredell&#x92;s statement discussing the Religious Test Clause at the North Carolina Ratifying Convention: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[Congress] certainly [has] no authority to interfere in the establishment of any religion whatsoever &#x2026; .  Is there any power given to Congress in matters of religion?  Can they pass a single act to impair our religious liberties?  If they could, it would be a just cause of alarm &#x2026; .  If any future Congress should pass an act concerning the religion of the country, it would be an act which they are not authorized to pass, by the Constitution, and which the people would not obey.&#x94;  Debate in North Carolina Ratifying Convention (June 30, 1788), in 5 Founders&#x92; Constitution 90 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987).

				These quotations do not establish the Framers&#x92; beliefs about the scope of the Establishment Clause.  Instead, they demonstrate only that some of the Framers may have believed that the National Government had no authority to legislate concerning religion, because no enumerated power gave it that authority.  Ohio&#x92;s Spending Clause and Commerce Clause challenges, therefore, may well have merit.  See n. 2,

				In any event, Ohio has not shown that the Establishment Clause codified Madison&#x92;s or Iredell&#x92;s view that the Federal Government could not legislate regarding religion.  An

Justice Story did say that &#x93;the whole power over the subject of religion is left exclusively to the state governments, to be acted upon according to their own sense of justice, and the state constitutions.&#x94;  Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 702&#x96;703 (1833) (reprinted 1987).  In context, however, his statement concerned only Congress&#x92; inability to legislate with respect to religious

				.  See 
				<em>

				 at 701 (&#x93;The real object of the amendment was &#x2026; to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment, which should give to an hierarchy the exclusive patronage of the national government&#x94;);

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In short, the view that the Establishment Clause precludes Congress from legislating respecting religion lacks historical provenance, at least based on the history of which I am aware.  Even when enacting laws that bind the States pursuant to valid exercises of its enumerated powers, Congress need not observe strict separation between church and state, or steer clear of the subject of religion.  It need only refrain from making laws &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion&#x94;; it must not interfere with a state establishment of religion.  For example, Congress presumably could not require a State to establish a religion any more than it could preclude a State from establishing a religion.

				On its face&#x97;the relevant inquiry, as this is a facial challenge&#x97;RLUIPA is not a law &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion.&#x94;  RLUIPA provides, as relevant: &#x93;No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, &#x2026; even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,&#x94; first, &#x93;further[s] a compelling governmental interest,&#x94; and second, &#x93;is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-1.html#a_1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(a)(1)</a>&#x96;(2).  This provision does not prohibit or interfere with state establishments, since no State has established (or constitutionally could establish, given an incorporated Clause) a religion.  Nor does the provision require a State to establish a religion: It does not force a State to coerce religious observance or payment of taxes supporting clergy, or require a State to prefer one religious sect over another.  It is a law respecting religion, but not one respecting an establishment of religion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In addition, RLUIPA&#x92;s text applies to all laws passed by state and local governments, including &#x93;rule[s] of general applicability,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, whether or not they concern an establishment of religion.  State and local governments obviously have many laws that have nothing to do with religion, let alone establishments thereof.  Numerous applications of RLUIPA therefore do not contravene the Establishment Clause, and a facial challenge based on the Clause must fail.  See

				It also bears noting that Congress, pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, conditioned the States&#x92; receipt of federal funds on their compliance with RLUIPA.  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(b)(1) (&#x93;This section applies in any case in which &#x2026; the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance&#x94;).  As noted above, n. 2, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, RLUIPA may well exceed the spending power.  Nonetheless, while Congress&#x92; condition stands, the States subject themselves to that condition by voluntarily accepting federal funds.  The States&#x92; voluntary acceptance of Congress&#x92; condition undercuts Ohio&#x92;s argument that Congress is encroaching on its turf.

						 The Court properly declines to assess RLUIPA under the discredited test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/602" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 602</a> (1971)
, which the Court of Appeals applied below, 349 F. 3d 257, 262&#x96;268 (CA6 2003).  Lemon held that, to avoid invalidation under the Establishment Clause, a statute &#x93;must have a secular legislative purpose,&#x94; &#x93;its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion,&#x94; and it &#x93;must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.&#x94;  403 U. S., at 612&#x96;613 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Under the first and second prongs, RLUIPA&#x97;and, indeed, any accommodation of religion&#x97;might well violate the Clause.  Even laws disestablishing religion might violate the Clause.  Disestablishment might easily have a religious purpose and thereby flunk the first prong, or it might well &#x93;strengthen and revitalize&#x94; religion and so fail the second.

						 The Court dismisses the parties&#x92; arguments about the federalism aspect of the Clause with the brief observation that the Court of Appeals did not address the issue.  Ante, at 7&#x96;8, n. 7.  The parties&#x92; contentions on this point, however, are fairly included in the question presented, which asks &#x93;[w]hether Congress violated the Establishment Clause by enacting [RLUIPA].&#x94;  Pet. for Cert. i.  Further, both parties have briefed the federalism understanding of the Clause, Brief for Respondents 25&#x96;33; Reply Brief for Petitioners 12&#x96;16, and neither suggests that a remand on it would be useful or that the record in this Court lacks relevant facts, Good News Club v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">9</a> (2001)

Also, though RLUIPA is entirely consonant with the Establishment Clause, it may well exceed Congress&#x92; authority under either the Spending Clause or the Commerce Clause. See Sabri v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/600" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 600</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">613</a> (2004)
 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (for a spending clause condition on a State&#x92;s receipt of funds to be &#x93;Necessary and Proper&#x94; to the expenditure of the funds, there must be &#x93;some obvious, simple, and direct relation&#x94; between the condition and the expenditure of the funds); United States v. Lopez, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/549" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 549</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">587</a> (1995)
 (Thomas, J., concurring) (&#x93;The Constitution not only uses the word &#x91;commerce&#x92; in a narrower sense than our case law might suggest, it also does not support the proposition that Congress has authority over all activities that &#x91;substantially affect&#x92; interstate commerce&#x94;).  The Court, however, properly declines to reach those issues, since they are outside the question presented and were not addressed by the Court of Appeals.

				History, at least that presented by Ohio, does not show that the Clause hermetically seals the Federal Government out of the field of religion.  Ohio points to, among other things, the words of James Madison in defense of the Constitution at the Virginia Ratifying Convention: &#x93;There is not a shadow of right in the general government to intermeddle with religion.  Its least interference with it would be a most flagrant usurpation.&#x94;  General Defense of the Constitution (June 12, 1788), reprinted in 11 Papers of James Madison 130 (R. Rutland, C. Hobson, W. Rachal, &amp; J. Sisson eds. 1977).  Ohio also relies on James Iredell&#x92;s statement discussing the Religious Test Clause at the North Carolina Ratifying Convention: 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[Congress] certainly [has] no authority to interfere in the establishment of any religion whatsoever &#x2026; .  Is there any power given to Congress in matters of religion?  Can they pass a single act to impair our religious liberties?  If they could, it would be a just cause of alarm &#x2026; .  If any future Congress should pass an act concerning the religion of the country, it would be an act which they are not authorized to pass, by the Constitution, and which the people would not obey.&#x94;  Debate in North Carolina Ratifying Convention (June 30, 1788), in 5 Founders&#x92; Constitution 90 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987).

				These quotations do not establish the Framers&#x92; beliefs about the scope of the Establishment Clause.  Instead, they demonstrate only that some of the Framers may have believed that the National Government had no authority to legislate concerning religion, because no enumerated power gave it that authority.  Ohio&#x92;s Spending Clause and Commerce Clause challenges, therefore, may well have merit.  See n. 2, 
				<em>

				In any event, Ohio has not shown that the Establishment Clause codified Madison&#x92;s or Iredell&#x92;s view that the Federal Government could not legislate regarding religion.  An 
				<em>

				</em>
				 version of the Clause, proposed in the House of Representatives, demonstrates the opposite.  It provided that &#x93;Congress shall make no laws touching religion, or infringing the rights of conscience.&#x94;  1 Annals of Cong. 731 (1789); see also

Justice Story did say that &#x93;the whole power over the subject of religion is left exclusively to the state governments, to be acted upon according to their own sense of justice, and the state constitutions.&#x94;  Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 702&#x96;703 (1833) (reprinted 1987).  In context, however, his statement concerned only Congress&#x92; inability to legislate with respect to religious 
				<em>

				.  See 
				<em>
					id.,
				</em>
				 at 701 (&#x93;The real object of the amendment was &#x2026; to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment, which should give to an hierarchy the exclusive patronage of the national government&#x94;); 
				<em>

				 at 702 (&#x93;[I]t was deemed advisable to exclude from the national government all power to act upon the subject &#x2026; . It was impossible, that there should not arise perpetual strife and perpetual jealousy on the subject of ecclesiastical ascendancy, if the national government were left free to create a religious establishment&#x94;).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In short, the view that the Establishment Clause precludes Congress from legislating respecting religion lacks historical provenance, at least based on the history of which I am aware.  Even when enacting laws that bind the States pursuant to valid exercises of its enumerated powers, Congress need not observe strict separation between church and state, or steer clear of the subject of religion.  It need only refrain from making laws &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion&#x94;; it must not interfere with a state establishment of religion.  For example, Congress presumably could not require a State to establish a religion any more than it could preclude a State from establishing a religion.

				On its face&#x97;the relevant inquiry, as this is a facial challenge&#x97;RLUIPA is not a law &#x93;respecting an establishment of religion.&#x94;  RLUIPA provides, as relevant: &#x93;No government shall impose a substantial burden on the religious exercise of a person residing in or confined to an institution, &#x2026; even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the government demonstrates that imposition of the burden on that person,&#x94; first, &#x93;further[s] a compelling governmental interest,&#x94; and second, &#x93;is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/42/2000cc-1.html#a_1" class="subref" title="subref">42 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(a)(1)</a>&#x96;(2).  This provision does not prohibit or interfere with state establishments, since no State has established (or constitutionally could establish, given an incorporated Clause) a religion.  Nor does the provision require a State to establish a religion: It does not force a State to coerce religious observance or payment of taxes supporting clergy, or require a State to prefer one religious sect over another.  It is a law respecting religion, but not one respecting an establishment of religion.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				In addition, RLUIPA&#x92;s text applies to all laws passed by state and local governments, including &#x93;rule[s] of general applicability,&#x94; 
				<em>
					ibid.
				</em>
				, whether or not they concern an establishment of religion.  State and local governments obviously have many laws that have nothing to do with religion, let alone establishments thereof.  Numerous applications of RLUIPA therefore do not contravene the Establishment Clause, and a facial challenge based on the Clause must fail.  See

				It also bears noting that Congress, pursuant to its Spending Clause authority, conditioned the States&#x92; receipt of federal funds on their compliance with RLUIPA.  &#xA7;2000cc&#x96;1(b)(1) (&#x93;This section applies in any case in which &#x2026; the substantial burden is imposed in a program or activity that receives Federal financial assistance&#x94;).  As noted above, n. 2, 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, RLUIPA may well exceed the spending power.  Nonetheless, while Congress&#x92; condition stands, the States subject themselves to that condition by voluntarily accepting federal funds.  The States&#x92; voluntary acceptance of Congress&#x92; condition undercuts Ohio&#x92;s argument that Congress is encroaching on its turf.

						 The Court properly declines to assess RLUIPA under the discredited test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/403/602" class="subref" title="subref">403 U. S. 602</a> (1971)
, which the Court of Appeals applied below, 349 F. 3d 257, 262&#x96;268 (CA6 2003).  Lemon held that, to avoid invalidation under the Establishment Clause, a statute &#x93;must have a secular legislative purpose,&#x94; &#x93;its principal or primary effect must be one that neither advances nor inhibits religion,&#x94; and it &#x93;must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.&#x94;  403 U. S., at 612&#x96;613 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Under the first and second prongs, RLUIPA&#x97;and, indeed, any accommodation of religion&#x97;might well violate the Clause.  Even laws disestablishing religion might violate the Clause.  Disestablishment might easily have a religious purpose and thereby flunk the first prong, or it might well &#x93;strengthen and revitalize&#x94; religion and so fail the second.  McConnell, Establishment and Disestablishment at the Founding, Part I: Establishment of Religion, 44 Wm. &amp; Mary L. Rev. 2105, 2206&#x96;2207 (2003) (hereinafter McConnell).

						 The Court dismisses the parties&#x92; arguments about the federalism aspect of the Clause with the brief observation that the Court of Appeals did not address the issue.  Ante, at 7&#x96;8, n. 7.  The parties&#x92; contentions on this point, however, are fairly included in the question presented, which asks &#x93;[w]hether Congress violated the Establishment Clause by enacting [RLUIPA].&#x94;  Pet. for Cert. i.  Further, both parties have briefed the federalism understanding of the Clause, Brief for Respondents 25&#x96;33; Reply Brief for Petitioners 12&#x96;16, and neither suggests that a remand on it would be useful or that the record in this Court lacks relevant facts, Good News Club v. Milford Central School, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/533/98" class="subref" title="subref">533 U. S. 98</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">119</a>, n. 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">9</a> (2001)
.


Also, though RLUIPA is entirely consonant with the Establishment Clause, it may well exceed Congress&#x92; authority under either the Spending Clause or the Commerce Clause. See Sabri v. United States, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/541/600" class="subref" title="subref">541 U. S. 600</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">613</a> (2004)
 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (for a spending clause condition on a State&#x92;s receipt of funds to be &#x93;Necessary and Proper&#x94; to the expenditure of the funds, there must be &#x93;some obvious, simple, and direct relation&#x94; between the condition and the expenditure of the funds); United States v. Lopez, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/514/549" class="subref" title="subref">514 U. S. 549</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">587</a> (1995)
 (Thomas, J., concurring) (&#x93;The Constitution not only uses the word &#x91;commerce&#x92; in a narrower sense than our case law might suggest, it also does not support the proposition that Congress has authority over all activities that &#x91;substantially affect&#x92; interstate commerce&#x94;).  The Court, however, properly declines to reach those issues, since they are outside the question presented and were not addressed by the Court of Appeals.

						 Ohio claims the benefit of the federalism aspect of the Clause, yet simultaneously adheres to the view that the Establishment Clause was incorporated against the States through the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentxiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourteenth Amendment</a>.  Brief for Respondents 25&#x96;26.  These positions may be incompatible.  The text and history of the Clause may well support the view that the Clause is not incorporated against the States precisely because the Clause shielded state establishments from congressional interference.  Elk Grove Unified School Dist. v. Newdow, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/542/1" class="subref" title="subref">542 U. S. 1</a> (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  I note, however, that a state law that would violate the incorporated Establishment Clause might also violate the Free Exercise Clause.  Id., at 53, n. 4, 54, n. 5.
