				Over several years, the Bureau of Indian Affairs contracted with respondent Blaze Construction Company to build, repair, and improve roads on several Indian reservations located in Arizona.  At the end of the contracting period, petitioner Arizona Department of Revenue (Department) issued a tax deficiency assessment against Blaze for its failure to pay Arizona&#x92;s transaction privilege tax on the proceeds from its contracts with the Bureau; that tax is levied on the gross receipts of companies doing business in the State.  Blaze protested the assessment and prevailed in administrative proceedings, but the Arizona Tax Court granted the Department summary judgment.  The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed, rejecting the Department&#x92;s argument that

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/455/720" class="subref" title="subref">455 U. S. 720</a>, controlled, and holding that federal law pre-empted the tax&#x92;s application to Blaze. 
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
            <em>
					Held:&lt;unicode value="8194"&gt; 
				</em>
				A State generally may impose a nondiscriminatory tax upon a private company&#x92;s proceeds from contracts with the Federal Government, regardless of whether the federal contractor renders its services on an Indian reservation.  In 
				<em>
					New Mexico, supra,
				</em>
				 the Court announced a clear rule that tax immunity is appropriate only when the levy falls on the United States itself, or on its agency or closely connected instrumentality.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 733.  To expand that immunity beyond these narrow constitutional limits, Congress must 
				<em>
					expressly
				</em>
				 so provide.  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 737.  Thus, absent a constitutional immunity or congressional exemption, federal law does not shield Blaze from Arizona&#x92;s transaction privilege tax.  The incidence of the tax falls on Blaze, not the Government; nor has Congress exempted these contracts from taxation.  Nevertheless, the Arizona Court of Appeals employed a balancing test weighing state, federal, and tribal interests, and held that a congressional intent to pre-empt the tax could be inferred from federal laws regulating Indian welfare.  In cases involving taxation of on-reservation activity, this Court has undertaken such a particularized examination where the tax&#x92;s legal incidence fell on a nontribal entity engaged in a transaction with tribes or tribal members.

				In 
				<em>
					New Mexico
				</em>
				, we considered whether a State could impose gross receipts and use taxes on the property, income, and purchases of private federal contractors.  To remedy &#x93;the confusing nature of our precedents&#x94; in this area, 455 U. S., at 733, we announced a clear rule:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[T]ax immunity is appropriate in only one circumstance: when the levy falls on the United States itself, or on an agency or instrumentality so closely connected to the Government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities, at least insofar as the activity being taxed is concerned.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 735.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
We reasoned that this &#x93;narrow approach&#x94; to the scope of governmental tax immunity &#x93;accord[ed] with competing constitutional imperatives, by giving full range to each sovereign&#x92;s taxing authority.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 735&#x96;736 (citing 
				<em>
					Graves
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					New York ex rel. O&#x92;Keefe
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/306/466" class="subref" title="subref">306 U. S. 466</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">483</a> (1939)
).  For that immunity to be expanded beyond these &#x93;narrow constitutional limits,&#x94; we explained that Congress must &#x93;take responsibility for the decision, by so 
				<em>
					expressly
				</em>
				 providing as respects contracts in a particular form, or contracts under particular programs.&#x94;  455 U. S., at 737 (emphasis added); see also
				<em>

				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">234</a> (1952)
.  Applying those principles, we upheld each of the taxes at issue in that case because the legal incidence of the taxes fell on the contractors, not the Federal Government; the contractors could not be considered agencies or instrumentalities of the Federal Government; and Congress had not expressly exempted the contractors&#x92; activities from taxation but, rather, had expressly repealed a pre-existing statutory exemption.  See
				<em>
					 New Mexico
				</em>
				, 455 U. S., at 743&#x96;744.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				These principles control the resolution of this case. Absent a constitutional immunity or congressional exemption, federal law does not shield Blaze from Arizona&#x92;s transaction privilege tax.  See 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 737; 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">161</a> (1937)
.  The incidence of Arizona&#x92;s transaction privilege tax falls on Blaze, not the Federal Government.  Blaze does not argue that it is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government, and 
				<em>
					New Mexico
				</em>
				&#x92;s clear rule would have foreclosed any such argument under these circumstances.  Nor has Congress exempted these contracts from taxation.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Carson, supra, 
				</em>
				at 234. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nevertheless, the Arizona Court of Appeals held (and Blaze urges here) that the tax cannot be applied to activities taking place on Indian reservations.

				Our conclusion in no way limits the Tribes&#x92; ample opportunity to advance their interests when they choose to do so.  Under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">88</a>Stat.
2203, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/25/450.html" class="subref" title="subref">25 U. S. C. &#xA7;450</a>, 
				<em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				, (1994 ed. and Supp. III), a tribe may request the Secretary of Interior to enter into a self-determination contract &#x93;to plan, conduct, and administer programs or portions thereof, including construction programs.&#x94;  &#xA7;450f(a)(1).  Where a tribe enters into such a contract, it assumes greater responsibility over the management of the federal funds and the operation of certain federal programs.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/25/900" class="subref" title="subref">25 CFR &#xA7;900.3</a>(b)(4) (1998).  Here, the Tribes on whose reservations Blaze&#x92;s work was performed have not exercised this option, and the Federal Government has retained contracting responsibility.  Because the Tribes in this case have not assumed this responsibility, we have no occasion to consider whether the Indian preemption doctrine would apply when Tribes choose to take a more direct and active role in administering the federal funds.  Therefore, we see no need to depart from the clear rule announced in

						 Blaze also appears to argue that Arizona&#x92;s tax infringes on the Tribes&#x92; right to make their own decisions and be governed by them and that this is sufficient, by itself, to preclude application of Arizona&#x92;s tax.  See Williams v. Lee,

.  Our decisions upholding state taxes in a variety of on-reservation settings squarely foreclose that argument.  See, e.g., Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation,

				Our conclusion in no way limits the Tribes&#x92; ample opportunity to advance their interests when they choose to do so.  Under the Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">88</a>Stat.
2203, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/25/450.html" class="subref" title="subref">25 U. S. C. &#xA7;450</a>, 
				<em>
					et seq.
				</em>
				, (1994 ed. and Supp. III), a tribe may request the Secretary of Interior to enter into a self-determination contract &#x93;to plan, conduct, and administer programs or portions thereof, including construction programs.&#x94;  &#xA7;450f(a)(1).  Where a tribe enters into such a contract, it assumes greater responsibility over the management of the federal funds and the operation of certain federal programs.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/25/900" class="subref" title="subref">25 CFR &#xA7;900.3</a>(b)(4) (1998).  Here, the Tribes on whose reservations Blaze&#x92;s work was performed have not exercised this option, and the Federal Government has retained contracting responsibility.  Because the Tribes in this case have not assumed this responsibility, we have no occasion to consider whether the Indian preemption doctrine would apply when Tribes choose to take a more direct and active role in administering the federal funds.  Therefore, we see no need to depart from the clear rule announced in 
				<em>

						 Blaze also appears to argue that Arizona&#x92;s tax infringes on the Tribes&#x92; right to make their own decisions and be governed by them and that this is sufficient, by itself, to preclude application of Arizona&#x92;s tax.  See Williams v. Lee,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">220</a> (1959)
.  Our decisions upholding state taxes in a variety of on-reservation settings squarely foreclose that argument.  See, e.g., Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation,

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/490/163" class="subref" title="subref">490 U. S. 163</a> (1989)

				, (1994 ed. and Supp. III), a tribe may request the Secretary of Interior to enter into a self-determination contract &#x93;to plan, conduct, and administer programs or portions thereof, including construction programs.&#x94;  &#xA7;450f(a)(1).  Where a tribe enters into such a contract, it assumes greater responsibility over the management of the federal funds and the operation of certain federal programs.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/25/900" class="subref" title="subref">25 CFR &#xA7;900.3</a>(b)(4) (1998).  Here, the Tribes on whose reservations Blaze&#x92;s work was performed have not exercised this option, and the Federal Government has retained contracting responsibility.  Because the Tribes in this case have not assumed this responsibility, we have no occasion to consider whether the Indian preemption doctrine would apply when Tribes choose to take a more direct and active role in administering the federal funds.  Therefore, we see no need to depart from the clear rule announced in

						 Blaze also appears to argue that Arizona&#x92;s tax infringes on the Tribes&#x92; right to make their own decisions and be governed by them and that this is sufficient, by itself, to preclude application of Arizona&#x92;s tax.  See Williams v. Lee,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">220</a> (1959)
.  Our decisions upholding state taxes in a variety of on-reservation settings squarely foreclose that argument.  See, e.g., Washington v. Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/447/134" class="subref" title="subref">447 U. S. 134</a>,

				Over a several-year period, the Bureau of Indian Affairs contracted with Blaze Construction Company to build, repair, and improve roads on the Navajo, Hopi, Fort Apache, Colorado River, Tohono O&#x92;Odham, and San Carlos Apache Indian Reservations in Arizona.  Blaze is incorporated under the laws of the Blackfeet Tribe of Montana and is owned by a member of that Tribe.  But, as the company concedes, Blaze is the equivalent of a non-Indian for purposes of this case because none of its work occurred on the Blackfeet Reservation.  Brief in Opposition 2, n. 1; see

				At the end of the contracting period, the Arizona Department of Revenue (Department) issued a tax deficiency assessment against Blaze for its failure to pay Arizona&#x92;s transaction privilege tax on the proceeds from its contracts with the Bureau; that tax is levied on the gross receipts of companies doing business in the State.

Blaze protested the assessment and prevailed at the end of administrative proceedings, but, on review, the Arizona Tax Court granted summary judgment in the Department&#x92;s favor.  The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed.  190 Ariz. 262, 947 P. 2d 836 (1997).  It rejected the Department&#x92;s argument that our decision in

				<em>
					 
				</em>
				and held that federal law pre-empted the application of Arizona&#x92;s transaction privilege tax to Blaze.  The Arizona Supreme Court denied the Department&#x92;s petition for review, with one justice voting to grant the petition.  We granted certiorari, 523 U. S. ___ (1998), and now reverse.

				In 
				<em>
					New Mexico
				</em>
				, we considered whether a State could impose gross receipts and use taxes on the property, income, and purchases of private federal contractors.  To remedy &#x93;the confusing nature of our precedents&#x94; in this area, 455 U. S., at 733, we announced a clear rule:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[T]ax immunity is appropriate in only one circumstance: when the levy falls on the United States itself, or on an agency or instrumentality so closely connected to the Government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities, at least insofar as the activity being taxed is concerned.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 735.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
We reasoned that this &#x93;narrow approach&#x94; to the scope of governmental tax immunity &#x93;accord[ed] with competing constitutional imperatives, by giving full range to each sovereign&#x92;s taxing authority.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 735&#x96;736 (citing 
				<em>
					Graves
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					New York ex rel. O&#x92;Keefe
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/306/466" class="subref" title="subref">306 U. S. 466</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">483</a> (1939)
).  For that immunity to be expanded beyond these &#x93;narrow constitutional limits,&#x94; we explained that Congress must &#x93;take responsibility for the decision, by so 
				<em>
					expressly
				</em>
				 providing as respects contracts in a particular form, or contracts under particular programs.&#x94;  455 U. S., at 737 (emphasis added); see also
				<em>
					 Carson
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Roane-Anderson Co.
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/342/232" class="subref" title="subref">342 U. S. 232</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">234</a> (1952)
.  Applying those principles, we upheld each of the taxes at issue in that case because the legal incidence of the taxes fell on the contractors, not the Federal Government; the contractors could not be considered agencies or instrumentalities of the Federal Government; and Congress had not expressly exempted the contractors&#x92; activities from taxation but, rather, had expressly repealed a pre-existing statutory exemption.  See
				<em>
					 New Mexico
				</em>
				, 455 U. S., at 743&#x96;744.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				These principles control the resolution of this case. Absent a constitutional immunity or congressional exemption, federal law does not shield Blaze from Arizona&#x92;s transaction privilege tax.  See 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 737; 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">161</a> (1937)
.  The incidence of Arizona&#x92;s transaction privilege tax falls on Blaze, not the Federal Government.  Blaze does not argue that it is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government, and 
				<em>
					New Mexico
				</em>
				&#x92;s clear rule would have foreclosed any such argument under these circumstances.  Nor has Congress exempted these contracts from taxation.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Carson, supra, 
				</em>
				at 234. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nevertheless, the Arizona Court of Appeals held (and Blaze urges here) that the tax cannot be applied to activities taking place on Indian reservations.

				Over a several-year period, the Bureau of Indian Affairs contracted with Blaze Construction Company to build, repair, and improve roads on the Navajo, Hopi, Fort Apache, Colorado River, Tohono O&#x92;Odham, and San Carlos Apache Indian Reservations in Arizona.  Blaze is incorporated under the laws of the Blackfeet Tribe of Montana and is owned by a member of that Tribe.  But, as the company concedes, Blaze is the equivalent of a non-Indian for purposes of this case because none of its work occurred on the Blackfeet Reservation.  Brief in Opposition 2, n. 1; see

				At the end of the contracting period, the Arizona Department of Revenue (Department) issued a tax deficiency assessment against Blaze for its failure to pay Arizona&#x92;s transaction privilege tax on the proceeds from its contracts with the Bureau; that tax is levied on the gross receipts of companies doing business in the State.

Blaze protested the assessment and prevailed at the end of administrative proceedings, but, on review, the Arizona Tax Court granted summary judgment in the Department&#x92;s favor.  The Arizona Court of Appeals reversed.  190 Ariz. 262, 947 P. 2d 836 (1997).  It rejected the Department&#x92;s argument that our decision in 
				<em>
					New Mexico, supra,
				</em>
				 controlled the case
				<em>
					 
				</em>
				and held that federal law pre-empted the application of Arizona&#x92;s transaction privilege tax to Blaze.  The Arizona Supreme Court denied the Department&#x92;s petition for review, with one justice voting to grant the petition.  We granted certiorari, 523 U. S. ___ (1998), and now reverse.

				In 
				<em>
					New Mexico
				</em>
				, we considered whether a State could impose gross receipts and use taxes on the property, income, and purchases of private federal contractors.  To remedy &#x93;the confusing nature of our precedents&#x94; in this area, 455 U. S., at 733, we announced a clear rule:
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				&#x93;[T]ax immunity is appropriate in only one circumstance: when the levy falls on the United States itself, or on an agency or instrumentality so closely connected to the Government that the two cannot realistically be viewed as separate entities, at least insofar as the activity being taxed is concerned.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id., 
				</em>
				at 735.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
We reasoned that this &#x93;narrow approach&#x94; to the scope of governmental tax immunity &#x93;accord[ed] with competing constitutional imperatives, by giving full range to each sovereign&#x92;s taxing authority.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 735&#x96;736 (citing 
				<em>
					Graves
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					New York ex rel. O&#x92;Keefe
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/306/466" class="subref" title="subref">306 U. S. 466</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">483</a> (1939)
).  For that immunity to be expanded beyond these &#x93;narrow constitutional limits,&#x94; we explained that Congress must &#x93;take responsibility for the decision, by so 
				<em>
					expressly
				</em>
				 providing as respects contracts in a particular form, or contracts under particular programs.&#x94;  455 U. S., at 737 (emphasis added); see also
				<em>
					 Carson
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Roane-Anderson Co.
				</em>
				, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/342/232" class="subref" title="subref">342 U. S. 232</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">234</a> (1952)
.  Applying those principles, we upheld each of the taxes at issue in that case because the legal incidence of the taxes fell on the contractors, not the Federal Government; the contractors could not be considered agencies or instrumentalities of the Federal Government; and Congress had not expressly exempted the contractors&#x92; activities from taxation but, rather, had expressly repealed a pre-existing statutory exemption.  See
				<em>
					 New Mexico
				</em>
				, 455 U. S., at 743&#x96;744.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				These principles control the resolution of this case. Absent a constitutional immunity or congressional exemption, federal law does not shield Blaze from Arizona&#x92;s transaction privilege tax.  See 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 737; 
				<em>
					James
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Dravo Contracting Co.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">161</a> (1937)
.  The incidence of Arizona&#x92;s transaction privilege tax falls on Blaze, not the Federal Government.  Blaze does not argue that it is an agency or instrumentality of the Federal Government, and 
				<em>
					New Mexico
				</em>
				&#x92;s clear rule would have foreclosed any such argument under these circumstances.  Nor has Congress exempted these contracts from taxation.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Carson, supra, 
				</em>
				at 234. 
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Nevertheless, the Arizona Court of Appeals held (and Blaze urges here) that the tax cannot be applied to activities taking place on Indian reservations.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">177</a> (1989)
, the court below held that a congressional intent to pre-empt Arizona&#x92;s tax could be inferred from federal laws regulating the welfare of Indians.  In cases involving taxation of on-reservation activity, we have undertaken this &#x93;particularized examination,&#x94;

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">838</a> (1982)
, where the legal incidence of the tax fell on a nontribal entity engaged in a transaction with tribes or tribal members.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>

				</em>
				at 176&#x96;187 (state severance tax imposed on non-Indian lessee&#x92;s production of oil and gas);

 (motor carrier license and use fuel taxes imposed on logging and hauling operations pursuant to contract with tribal enterprise).  But we have never employed this balancing test in a case such as this one where a State seeks to tax a transaction between the Federal Government and its non-Indian private contractor.

				We decline to do so now.  Interest balancing in this setting would only cloud the clear rule established by our decision in 
				<em>
