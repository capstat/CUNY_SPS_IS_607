    <p class="pro-indent">Petitioner's decedents were killed when their plane struck electric power lines on its approach to a city-run airfield in San Diego. She filed the present action against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1346#b" class="subref" title="28 U.S.C. 1346(b)">28 U.S.C. 1346(b)</a>, claiming that the Federal Aviation Administration had been negligent in its operation and maintenance of runway lights and in its performance of air traffic control functions. Petitioner subsequently moved to amend her complaint to add state tort-law claims against both the city and the utility company that maintained the power lines. The District Court granted the motion and asserted "pendent" jurisdiction under Mine Workers v. Gibbs, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/383/715" class="subref" title="383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218">383 U.S. 715, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218</a>, concluding that "judicial economy and efficiency" favored trying the actions together, and that the claims arose "from a common nucleus of operative facts." The Court of Appeals reversed on interlocutory appeal, categorically rejecting pendent-party jurisdiction under the FTCA.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Held: The text of the FTCA&#x97;which provides in pertinent part that the federal district courts shall have jurisdiction over "civil actions on claims against the United States"&#x97;defines jurisdiction in a manner that does not reach defendants other than the United States. This Court's decision in Aldinger v. Howard, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/427/1" class="subref" title="427 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 49 L.Ed.2d 276">427 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 49 L.Ed.2d 276</a>, made explicit the nontransferability of Gibbs to the context of pendent-party jurisdiction. Aldinger, Zahn v. International Paper Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/414/291" class="subref" title="414 U.S. 291, 94 S.Ct. 505, 38 L.Ed.2d 511">414 U.S. 291, 94 S.Ct. 505, 38 L.Ed.2d 511</a>, and Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co. v. Kroger,

Nor do the circumstances here suffice to establish "ancillary" jurisdiction. The unavailability of jurisdiction over the additional claims is unaltered by the exclusivity of federal jurisdiction under the FTCA, even though that may sometimes require separate suits in state and federal court. Finally, the 1948 revision of the Judicial Code, which changed the relevant language of the FTCA from "any claim against the United States" to its present form, does not suggest an affirmative grant of pendent-party jurisdiction, but is more naturally understood as a stylistic change reflecting the terminology of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.

    <p class="pro-indent">On the night of November 11, 1983, a twin-engine plane carrying petitioner's husband and two of her children struck electric transmission lines during its approach to a San Diego, California, airfield. No one survived the resulting crash. Petitioner brought a tort action in state court, claiming that San Diego Gas and Electric Company had negligently positioned and inadequately illuminated the transmission lines, and that the city of San Diego's negligent maintenance of the airport's runway lights had rendered them inoperative the night of the crash. When she later discovered that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was in fact the party responsible for the runway lights, petitioner filed the present action against the United States in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The complaint based jurisdiction upon the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA),

Almost a year later, she moved to amend the federal complaint to include claims against the original state-court defendants, as to which no independent basis for federal jurisdiction existed. The District Court granted petitioner's motion and asserted "pendent" jurisdiction under Mine Workers v. Gibbs,

        </a> Gibbs, which has come to stand for the principle in question, held that "pendent jurisdiction, in the sense of judicial power, exists whenever there is a claim 'arising under the Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority . . .,' U.S. Const., Art. III, &#xA7; 2, and the relationship between that claim and the state claim permits the conclusion that the entire action before the court comprises but one constitutional 'case.' "

The requisite relationship exists, Gibbs said, when the federal and nonfederal claims "derive from a common nucleus of operative fact" and are such that a plaintiff "would ordinarily be expected to try them in one judicial proceeding." Ibid. Petitioner contends that the same criterion applies here, leading to the result that her state-law claims against San Diego Gas and Electric Company and the city of San Diego may be heard in conjunction with her FTCA action against the United States.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Analytically, petitioner's case is fundamentally different from Gibbs in that it brings into question what has become known as pendent-party jurisdiction, that is, jurisdiction over parties not named in any claim that is independently cognizable by the federal court.<a name="fn2_ref" href="#fn2" class="">

        </a> We may assume, without deciding, that the constitutional criterion for pendent-party jurisdiction is analogous to the constitutional criterion for pendent-claim jurisdiction, and that petitioner's state-law claims pass that test. Our cases show, however, that with respect to the addition of parties, as opposed to the addition of only claims, we will not assume that the full constitutional power has been congressionally authorized, and will not read jurisdictional statutes broadly. In Zahn v. International Paper Co.,

Id., at 17, 96 S.Ct., at 2421. We held in Aldinger that the jurisdictional statute under which suit was brought,

The county had been "excluded from liability in &#xA7; 1983, and therefore by reference in the grant of jurisdiction under &#xA7; 1343(3)." Ibid. (emphasis in original).</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">We reaffirmed and further refined our approach to pendent-party jurisdiction in Owen Equipment &amp; Erection Co. v. Kroger, supra,

"Gibbs," we said, "does not end the inquiry into whether a federal court has power to hear the nonfederal claims along with the federal ones. Beyond this constitutional minimum, there must be an examination of the posture in which the nonfederal claim is asserted and of the specific statute that confers jurisdiction over the federal claim,"

While in a narrow class of cases a federal court may assert authority over such a claim "ancillary" to jurisdiction otherwise properly vested&#x97;for example, when an additional party has a claim upon contested assets within the court's exclusive control, see, e.g., Krippendorf v.

        </a> And little more basis than that can be relied upon by petitioner here. As in Kroger, the relationship between petitioner's added claims and the original complaint is one of "mere factual similarity," which is of no consequence since "neither the convenience of the litigants nor considerations of judicial economy can suffice to justify extension of the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction," 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/0" class="subref" title="437 U.S., at 376-377, 98 S.Ct., at 2404">437 U.S., at 376-377, 98 S.Ct., at 2404</a>. It is true that here, unlike in Kroger, see 
id., at 376, 98 S.Ct., at 2404, the party seeking to bring the added claims had little choice but to be in federal rather than state court, since the FTCA permits the Federal Government to be sued only there. But that alone is not enough, since we have held that suits against the United States under the Tucker Act, 
24 Stat. 505 (which can of course be brought only in federal court, see

    <p class="pro-indent">The second factor invoked by Kroger, the text of the jurisdictional statute at issue, likewise fails to establish petitioner's case. The FTCA, &#xA7; 1346(b), confers jurisdiction over "civil actions on claims against the United States." It does not say "civil actions on claims that include requested relief against the United States," nor "civil actions in which there is a claim against the United States"&#x97;formulations one might expect if the presence of a claim against the United States constituted merely a minimum jurisdictional requirement, rather than a definition of the permissible scope of FTCA actions. Just as the statutory provision "between . . . citizens of different States" has been held to mean citizens of different States and no one else, see Kroger, supra, so also here we conclude that "against the United States" means against the United States and no one else.<a name="fn5_ref" href="#fn5" class="">

62 Stat. 869. In its earlier form, the FTCA had conferred upon district courts "exclusive jurisdiction to hear, determine, and render judgment on any claim against the United States" for specified torts.

Petitioner argues that this broadened the scope of the statute, permitting the assertion of jurisdiction over any "civil action," so long as that action includes a claim against the United States. We disagree.</p>

We have found no suggestion, much less a clear expression, that the minor rewording at issue here imported a substantive c ange.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">The change from "claim against the United States" to "civil actions on claims against the United States" would be a strange way to express the substantive revision asserted by petitioner&#x97;but a perfectly understandable way to achieve another objective. The 1948 recodification came relatively soon after the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which provide that "there shall be one form of action to be known as 'civil action.' " Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 2. Consistent with this new terminology, the 1948 revision inserted the expression "civil action" throughout the provisions governing district-court jurisdiction. See H.R.Rep. No. 308, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., App. A114-A125 (1947) (Reviser's Notes).</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Reliance upon the 1948 recodification also ignores the fact that the concept of pendent-party jurisdiction was not considered remotely viable until Gibbs liberalized the concept of pendent-claim jurisdiction&#x97;nearly 20 years later. See 13B C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure &#xA7; 3567.2, pp. 146-148 (2d ed. 1984); Miller, Ancillary and Pendent Jurisdiction, 26 S.Tex.L.J. 1, 11 (1985). Indeed, in 1948 even a relatively limited substantive expansion of pendent-claim jurisdiction with respect to unfair competition actions provoked considerable discussion, see Wechsler, Federal Jurisdiction and the Revision of the Judicial Code, 13 Law &amp; Contemp.Prob. 216, 232 (1948); Note, The Proposed Revision of the Federal Judicial Code, 60 Harv.L.Rev. 424, 430-431 (1947), and was described by the chief reviser as one of a dozen "major changes of law" effected by his handiwork, W. Barron, The Judicial Code 1948 Revision, 8 F.R.D. 439, 441-445 (1949). That change, in the already accepted realm of pendent-claim jurisdiction, was accomplished by wording that could not be mistaken, referring to "any civil action asserting a claim of unfair competition when joined with a substantial and related claim under the copyright, patent, or trademark laws." &#xA7; 1338(b), 
62 Stat. 931. It is inconceivable that the much more radical change of adopting pendent-party jurisdiction would have been effected by the minor and obscure change of wording at issue here&#x97;especially when that revision is more naturally understood as stylistic.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Because the FTCA permits the Government to be sued only in federal court, our holding that parties to related claims cannot necessarily be sued there means that the efficiency and convenience of a consolidated action will sometimes have to be forgone in favor of separate actions in state and federal courts. We acknowledged this potential consideration in Aldinger,

    <p class="pro-para">* * *</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">As we noted at the outset, our cases do not display an entirely consistent approach with respect to the necessity that jurisdiction be explicitly conferred. The Gibbs line of cases was a departure from prior practice, and a departure that we have no intent to limit or impair. But Aldinger indicated that the Gibbs approach would not be extended to the pendent-party field, and we decide today to retain that line. Whatever we say regarding the scope of jurisdiction conferred by a particular statute can of course be changed by Congress. What is of paramount importance is that Congress be able to legislate against a background of clear interpretive rules, so that it may know the effect of the language it adopts. All our cases&#x97;Zahn, Aldinger, and Kroger&#x97;have held that a grant of jurisdiction over claims involving particular parties does not itself confer jurisdiction over additional claims by or against different parties. Our decision today reaffirms that interpretive rule; the opposite would sow confusion.</p>

    <p class="pro-indent">Justice BLACKMUN, dissenting.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">If Aldinger v. Howard, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/427/1" class="subref" title="427 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 49 L.Ed.2d 276 (1976)">427 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 49 L.Ed.2d 276 (1976)</a>, required us to ask whether the Federal Tort Claims Act embraced "an affirmative grant of pendent-party jurisdiction," 
ante, at 553, I would agree with the majority that no such specific grant of jurisdiction is present. But, in my view, that is not the appropriate question under Aldinger. I read the Court's opinion in that case, rather, as requiring us to consider whether Congress has demonstrated an intent to exempt "the party as to whom jurisdiction pendent to the principal claim" is asserted from being haled into federal court. 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/427/0" class="subref" title="427 U.S., at 16, 96 S.Ct., at 2421">427 U.S., at 16, 96 S.Ct., at 2421</a> (emphasis omitted). And, as those of us in dissent in Aldinger observed, the Aldinger test would be rendered meaningless if the required intent could be found in the failure of the relevant jurisdictional statute to mention the type of party in question, "because all instances of asserted pendent-party jurisdiction will by definition involve a party as to whom Congress has impliedly 'addressed itself' by not expressly conferring subject-matter jurisdiction on the federal courts." 
Id., at 23, 96 S.Ct., at 2424 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting).</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">In Aldinger, the Court found the requisite intent to exclude municipalities from the relevant jurisdictional statute, because (the Court then thought) municipalities had been affirmatively excluded by Congress from the scope of 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983" class="subref" title="42 U.S.C. 1983">42 U.S.C. 1983</a>. In such a case, the Court barred the use of the pendent-party doctrine, for otherwise the doctrine would permit an end run around an express congressional limitation of federal power. See 
id., at 16-17, 96 S.Ct., at 2421.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">In the present case, I find no such substantive limitation. Nor, in my view, is there any other expression of congressional intent to exclude private defendants from federal tort claims litigation. United States v. Sherwood, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/312/584" class="subref" title="312 U.S. 584, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941)">312 U.S. 584, 61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058 (1941)</a>, is not to the contrary. There, this Court held that Congress did not intend under the Tucker Act to permit the district courts to adjudicate any cause of action that could not have been brought in the Court of Claims, an Article I court in which no private party could be a defendant. Sherwood did not turn solely on a canon of "conservatism which is appropriate in the case of a waiver of sovereign immunity." 
Id., at 590, 61 S.Ct., at 771. It turned also upon "the history of the Court of Claims' jurisdiction." 
Id., at 590-591, 61 S.Ct., at 771. There is no equivalent history of adjudication of tort claims against the United States in a tribunal without power to litigate the liability of private tortfeasors; thus, Sherwood does not require the result the Court reaches today.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">In a case not controlled by any express intent to limit the scope of a constitutional "case," Aldinger suggests that the appropriateness of pendent-party jurisdiction might turn on the "alignment of parties and claims," and that one significant factor is whether "the grant of jurisdiction to the federal court is exclusive," 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/427/0" class="subref" title="427 U.S., at 18, 96 S.Ct., at 2422">427 U.S., at 18, 96 S.Ct., at 2422</a>, as is the situation here. Where, as here, Congress' preference for a federal forum for a certain category of claims makes the federal forum the only possible one in which the constitutional case may be heard as a whole, the sensible result is to permit the exercise of pendent-party jurisdiction. Aldinger imposes no obstacle to that result, and I would not reach out to create one. I therefore dissent.</p>

    <p class="pro-indent">It is also undisputed that this power will not be defeated by the joinder of two private defendants. Rule 14(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure expressly authorizes the defendant to implead joint tortfeasors,<a name="fn8_ref" href="#fn8" class="">

Under the Rules, the impulse is toward entertaining the broadest possible scope of action consistent with fairness to the parties; joinder of claims, parties and remedies is strongly encouraged. Yet because the Hurn question involves issues of jurisdiction as well as convenience, there has been some tendency to limit its application to cases in which the state and federal claims are, as in Hurn, 'little more than the equivalent of different epithets to characterize the same group of circumstances.'

    <p class="pro-indent">In Leather's Best, Inc. v. S.S. Mormaclynx, 451 F.2d 800 (CA2 1971), Judge Friendly summarized the understanding of the Gibbs doctrine that prevailed in 1971, as follows:</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">"To be sure, the Gibbs Court was not confronted with the question whether pendent jurisdiction extended to a state claim against a party not named in the federal claim. But as we have recently observed in Astor-Honor, Inc. v. Grosset &amp; Dunlap, Inc., 441 F.2d 627, 629 (2 Cir.1971), 'Mr. Justice Brennan's language and the common sense considerations underlying it seem broad enough to cover that problem also. See Note, UMW v. Gibbs and Pendent Jurisdiction, 81 Harv.L.Rev. 657, 664 (1968).' In that decision, involving federal claims under the copyright laws and state claims of unfair trade practice and unfair competition, including a defendant not named in the copyright claims, we held that a federal court had power to hear a state claim against a party not named in the federal claim, provided the Gibbs test was met, noting that this conclusion was buttressed by our decisions concerning ancillary jurisdiction to entertain compulsory counterclaims under F.R.Civ.P. 13(a), United Artists Corp. v. Masterpiece Productions, Inc., 221 F.2d 213 (2 Cir.1955), and third-party claims under F.R.Civ.P. 14(a), Dery v. Wyer, 265 F.2d 804 (2 Cir.1959)." Id., at 809-810.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">It is noteworthy that in his Leather's Best opinion, Judge Friendly relied, in part, on the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, just as Justice BRENNAN had done in the Gibbs opinion itself. Indeed, in another paragraph of his opini n, Judge Friendly concluded that the 1966 amendments to the Rules made it appropriate to extend the ancillary jurisdiction doctrine to the admiralty context as well as to ordinary civil cases.<a name="fn20_ref" href="#fn20" class="">

    <p class="pro-indent">Before Judge Friendly addressed this issue for the third time, we decided Aldinger v. Howard, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/427/1" class="subref" title="427 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 49 L.Ed.2d 276 (1976)">427 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 49 L.Ed.2d 276 (1976)</a>. In that case, after declining to announce any general rule governing pendent-party jurisdiction, we held that such jurisdiction should not be exercised if Congress has "expressly or by implication negated its existence" in the statute granting subject-matter jurisdiction over the particular claim before the Court. 
Id., at 18-19, 96 S.Ct., at 2422. Specifically, we concluded that the Civil Rights Acts, as then interpreted, precluded the joinder of a municipal corporation as a defendant to a claim asserted pursuant to 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1983" class="subref" title="42 U.S.C. 1983">42 U.S.C. 1983</a> or to a state-law claim pendent to such a federal claim. Although a reasonable argument can be made that the Court misconstrued the intent of Congress in that case, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/427/0" class="subref" title="427 U.S., at 23-37, 96 S.Ct., at 2424-2430">427 U.S., at 23-37, 96 S.Ct., at 2424-2430</a> (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), there surely can be no quarrel with the proposition that Congress may withdraw or deny pendent jurisdiction over particular claims or parties.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">In his third "pendent-party" opinion, Judge Friendly correctly described the limited scope of our holding in Aldinger. He wrote:</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">"Although the Aldinger Court disapproved of the joinder of a pendent party defendant in the case before it, the Court explicitly limited its onclusion to 'the issue of so-called "pendent party" jurisdiction with respect to a claim brought under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1343#3" class="subref" title="28 U.S.C. 1343(3)">28 U.S.C. 1343(3)</a> and 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/42" class="subref" title="42">42</a> U.S.C. &#xA7; 1983,'

    <p class="pro-indent">"The circumstances here are about as powerful for the exercise of pendent party jurisdiction as can be imagined. The exclusivity of federal jurisdiction over claims for violation of the Securities Exchange Act makes a federal court the only one where a complete disposition of federal and related state claims can be rendered. Cf. the Court's comment in Aldinger that 'when the grant of jurisdiction to a federal court is exclusive, for example, as in the prosecution of tort claims against the United States under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1346" class="subref" title="28 U.S.C. 1346">28 U.S.C. 1346</a>, the argument of judicial economy and convenience can be coupled with the additional argument that only in federal court may all of the claims be tried together,' 427 U.S., at 18 . . . . 96 S.Ct., at 2422." Weinberger v. Kendrick, 698 F.2d 61, 76-77 (CA2 1982), cert. denied, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/464/818" class="subref" title="464 U.S. 818, 104 S.Ct. 77, 78 L.Ed.2d 89 (1983)">464 U.S. 818, 104 S.Ct. 77, 78 L.Ed.2d 89 (1983)</a>.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">In the Weinberger case the circumstances were "about as powerful for the exercise of pendent party jurisdiction as can be imagined" because Congress had vested the federal courts with exclusive jurisdiction over claims arising under the Securities Exchange Act. The Federal District Court was therefore the only forum in which the entire constitutional case could be tried at one time. That powerful circumstance is also present in cases arising under the FTCA. In fact, in dicta, the Aldinger Court suggested that pendent-party jurisdiction might be available under the FTCA for precisely this reason.

    <p class="pro-indent">I would thus hold that the grant of jurisdiction to hear "civil actions on claims against the United States" authorizes the federal courts to hear state-law claims against a pendent party. As many other judges have recognized,<a name="fn22_ref" href="#fn22" class="">

    <p class="pro-indent">The Court's contrary conclusion rests on an insufficient major premise, a failure to distinguish between diversity and federal-question cases, and an implicit reliance on a narrow view of the waiver of sovereign immunity in the FTCA.<a name="fn25_ref" href="#fn25" class="">

    </p>
    <p class="pro-indent">The Court treats the absence of an affirmative grant of jurisdiction by Congress as though it constituted the kind of implicit rejection of pendent jurisdiction that we found in Aldinger v. Howard, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/427/1" class="subref" title="427 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 49 L.Ed.2d 276 (1976)">427 U.S. 1, 96 S.Ct. 2413, 49 L.Ed.2d 276 (1976)</a>. Its opinion laboriously demonstrates that the FTCA "defines jurisdiction in a manner that does not reach defendants other than the United States," 
ante, at 553, and that the language of the statute cannot be construed as "adopting pendent-party jurisdiction," ante, at 555. That, of course, is always the predicate for the question whether a federal court may rely on the doctrine of ancillary or pendent jurisdiction to fill a gap in the relevant jurisdictional statute. If the Court's demonstration were controlling, Gibbs, Hurn, and Moore, as well as a good many other cases, were incorrectly decided.<a name="fn26_ref" href="#fn26" class="">

    <p class="pro-indent">In Aldinger, we adopted a rule of construction that assumed the existence of pendent jurisdiction unless "Congress in the statutes conferring jurisdiction has . . . expressly or by implication negated its existence,"

        </a> Congress' exclusion of municipal corporations from the definition of persons under &#xA7; 1983, we concluded, evinced an intent to preclude the exercise of federal-court jurisdiction over them. If congressional silence were sufficient to defeat pendent jurisdiction, the careful reasoning in our Aldinger opinion was wholly unnecessary, for obviously the civil rights statutes do not affirmatively authorize the joinder of any state-law claims.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">A similar approach, focusing on a legislative intent to bar a party from federal court, guided our analysis in Zahn v. International Paper Co.,

In Zahn, we surveyed the "firmly rooted" law that "multiple plaintiffs with separate and distinct claims must each satisfy the jurisdictional-amount requirement for suit in federal courts," 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/414/0" class="subref" title="414 U.S., at 294, 94 S.Ct., at 508">414 U.S., at 294, 94 S.Ct., at 508</a>, and refused to adopt a rule that would allow putative plaintiffs who could not meet the jurisdictional amount to assert claims pendent to jurisdictionally sufficient claims. We noted that adoption of such a rule "would undermine the purpose and intent of Congress in providing that plaintiffs in diversity cases must present claims in excess of the specified jurisdictional amount" and would depart from "the historic construction of the jurisdictional statutes, left undisturbed by Congress over these many years." 
Id., at 301, 94 S.Ct., at 512. In Kroger, the rule at issue was the requirement that a plaintiff invoking diversity jurisdiction plead complete diversity. After noting the historical evidence demonstrating "a congressional mandate that diversity jurisdiction is not to be available when any plaintiff is a citizen of the same State as any defendant,"

    </p>
    <p class="pro-indent">The Court today adopts a sharply different approach. Without even so much as acknowledging our statement in Aldinger that before a federal court may exercise pendentparty jurisdiction it must satisfy itself that Congress "has not expressly or by implication negated its existence,"

Ante, at 556. This rule, the Court asserts, is necessary to provide Congress "a background of clear interpretative rules" and to avoid sowing confusion. Ibid. But as a method of statutory interpretation, the Court's approach is neither clear nor faithful to our judicial obligation to discern congressional intent. While with respect to the joinder of additional defendants on pendent state claims, the Court's mandate is now clear, its approach offers little guidance with respect to the many other claims that a court must address in the course of deciding a constitutional case. Because the Court provides no reason why the joinder of pendent defendants over whom there is no other basis of federal jurisdiction should differ from the joinder of pendent claims and other pendent parties,<a name="fn30_ref" href="#fn30" class="">

<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/255/356" class="subref" title="255 U.S. 356, 367, 41 S.Ct. 338, 342, 65 L.Ed. 673 (1921)">255 U.S. 356, 367, 41 S.Ct. 338, 342, 65 L.Ed. 673 (1921)</a>, and "imparts a fundamental bias against utilization of the federal forum owing to the deterrent effect imposed by the needless requirement of duplicate litigation if the federal forum is chosen."

    <p class="footnote"> Justice STEVENS apparently does not acknowledge the divergence in these lines of authority.  Nothing else can explain the belief expressed in his dissent that there is force in the argument that "[i]f the Court's demonstration [of lack of statutory authority] were controlling, Gibbs, Hurn, and Moore, as well as a good many other cases, were incorrectly decided."  Post, at 572.  For that is entirely canceled by the equally valid argument that, if lack of statutory authority were not controlling, Christianson, Firestone, Sewing Machine Companies, and McIntire, as well as a good many other cases, were incorrectly decided.</p>

That case involved jurisdiction over a counterclaim brought by and against parties who were already properly before the court on other, federal-question grounds.  His dissent generally ignores this distinction&#x97;a central distinction, as we shall later discuss between new parties and parties already before the court.</p>

In Dewey, the new defendant added in the equitable counterclaim was asserted to have been the recipient of a fraudulent conveyance from the insolvent plaintiff, and the counterclaim was brought under a West Virginia statute authorizing suits to set aside such conveyances in assistance of an anticipated judgment or decree against the conveying debtor.  Any decree on the counterclaim would presumably have been worthless if the fraudulent conveyance could not have been recaptured.</p>

Post, at 577.  It seems to us, however, that one could say precisely the same thing about the diversity jurisdiction involved in Kroger and Zahn:  When Congress has unequivocally indicated its intent that a plaintiff have a right to bring a diversity action in federal court, there is reason to believe that Congress did not intend that the substance of that right be diminished, etc.  We simply do not agree with the inference, in either context.</p>

    <p class="footnote"> Justice STEVENS says that "it is perfectly clear that the District Court has . . . statutory power to decide this case," post, at 560&#x97;which is true if one means this case against the United States.  His dissent then continues, however, "[i]t is also undisputed that this power will not be defeated by the joinder of two private defendants," ibid., supporting that statement by references to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 14(a) and 20(a), which permit the impleader and joinder of parties, post, at 560-561.  Unfortunately, the proposition in that second sentence is disputed.  Indeed, it is what this case is all about.  More precisely, it is not that the "statutory power to decide this case" is defeated by the joinder of a private party for purposes of a claim over which the District Court has no independent jurisdiction, but that the statutory power to decide a case including such a claim simply does not exist, since the FTCA provides jurisdiction only for claims against the United States. Rules 14(a) and 20(a) in no way alter that reality, since the Federal Rules explicitly provide that they "shall not be construed to extend . . . the jurisdiction of the United States district courts," Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 82.</p>

    <p class="footnote"> "Gibbs concerned a state-law claim jurisdictionally pendent to one of federal law, but no reason appears why the identical principles should not equally apply to pendent state-law claims involving the joinder of additional parties.  In either case the Art. III question concerns only the subject matter and not the in personam jurisdiction of the federal courts.  In either case the question of Art. III power in the federal judiciary to exercise subject-matter jurisdiction concerns whether the claims asserted are such as 'would ordinarily be expected to [be tried] in one judicial proceeding,' and the question of discretion addresses 'considerations of judicial economy, convenience and fairness to litigants.'</p>
    <p class="footnote">"To recognize that the addition of parties under the pendent jurisdiction of the federal courts will sometimes alter the balance of 'judicial economy, convenience and fairness,' or sometimes threaten to embroil federal courts in the resolution of uncertain questions of state law, and thereby make the exercise of this discretionary jurisdiction inappropriate, is only to spea  to the question of the proper exercise of judicial discretion in the circumstances and does not vitiate the Gibbs analysis or its application to the question of pendent-party jurisdiction."

At an earlier date, this difference might have affected our decision here.  But the rules of procedure in the admiralty and civil jurisdictions were merged in 1966, and we are of the opinion that at least since that merger, the constitutional rationale which underlies the doctrine of ancillary jurisdiction in the context of Rule 13(a) and Rule 14 may be applied to support the conclusion that a federal court has the power to hear a related state claim against a defendant not named in the federal claim regardless of whether the federal claim arises in the civil or admiralty jurisdiction.  Thus, we conclude that in a case such as this, where the facts underlying the state and federal claims are identical, a federal court vested with admiralty jurisdiction over a shipper's claim against the carrier for breach of contract of carriage does have the 'power' also to entertain its state tort claim against a pier operator."

While the presence of any of these factors in a particular case may weigh against the exercise of pendent jurisdiction, they certainly do not deprive the court of the power to hear the pendent claim.  The Yellow Cab Court provided sufficient answer in response to a similar complaint regarding the impleader of the United States in an action between private parties:</p>
    <p class="footnote">"Such difficulties are not insurmountable.  If, for example, a jury had been demanded in the Yellow Cab case, the decision of jury and nonjury issues could have been handled in a manner comparable to that used when issues of law are tried to a jury and issues of an equitable nature in the same case are tried by the court alone.  If special circumstances had demonstrated the inadvisability, in the first instance, of impleading the United States as a third-party defendant, the leave of court required by Rule 14 could have been denied.  If, at a later stage, the situation had called for a separation of the claims, the court could have ordered their separate trial.  Fed. Rules Civ.Proc., 42(b).  The availability of third-party procedure is intended to facilitate, not to preclude, the trial of multiple claims which otherwise would be triable only in separate proceedings.

    <p class="footnote"> The Court notes that the 1948 recodification of the Judicial Code, which amended the jurisdictional grant in the FTCA to provide for " 'civil actions on claims against the United States,' " came relatively soon after the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, providing that " '[t]here shall be one form of action to be known as "civil action." ' "   Ante, at 554 (quoting Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 2).  The Court, however, rejects reliance on the plain meaning of the words "civil action"&#x97;which after all might explain the assertion of pendent-claim, as well as pendent-party, jurisdiction, see Freer, A Principled Statutory Approach to Supplemental Jurisdiction, 1987 Duke L.J. 34, 56-58&#x97;on the basis of dubious legislative history that the revisers did not intend to effect such a radical change through "the minor and obscure change of wording at issue here."  Ante, at 555.  The authorities the Court cites do not support this proposition.  See W. Barron, The Judicial Code 1948 Revision, 8 F.R.D. 439, 442 (1949) (characterizing &#xA7; 1338(b) as "statutory confirmation of the jurisdiction of federal courts").</p>
    <p class="footnote">Ironically, the Court does not rely on the legislative history that could support its judgment.  The legislative history of the FTCA indicates that Congress may have originally intended that the United States not be joined as a defendant in an action with private parties.  The House Report on an earlier version of what eventually became the FTCA thus stated:  "The bill therefore does not permit any person to be joined as a defendant with the United States and does not lift the immunity of the United States from tort actions except as jurisdiction is specifically conferred upon the district courts by this bill.  (See United States v. Sherwood, 312 U.S. 584[, 
61 S.Ct. 767, 85 L.Ed. 1058] (1941); Lynn v. United States, 110 F.(2d) 586, 588 (C.C.A. 5th 1940); Waite v. United States, 57 C.Cls. 546 (1922);  Jackson v. United States, 27 C.Cls. 74, 84 (1891))."  H.R.Rep. No. 1287, 79th Cong., 1st Sess., 5 (1945).  The Court in Yellow Cab rejected the identical argument, noting that those statements "were entirely omitted from even the sectional analysis of the measure when in 1946 it was incorporated in the Reorganization Bill and the report on it was made by the Senate Committee on the Organization of Congress."

That statement came in the context of the discussion of the "purely factual" differences in efficiency between the two situations&#x97;concerns which the Court accurately notes do not go to the power to exercise pendent jurisdiction. The only legal difference the Aldinger Court identified was one of statutory construction.  In &#xA7; 1343 and &#xA7; 1983, as opposed to the statutes under which the Court had exercised pendent-claim jurisdiction, "Congress ha[d] addressed itself to the party as to whom jurisdiction pendent to the principal claim [was] sought" and expressly excluded it from federal jurisdiction.

That is, diversity jurisdiction does not exist unless each defendant is a citizen of a different State from each plaintiff.

    <p class="footnote"> Consider, for example, the counterclaim cases in which the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure defined the scope of the jurisdiction granting statute in precisely the same way the Rules did in Gibbs:</p>
    <p class="footnote">"We conclude that, in the case of a counterclaim which is compulsory, ancillary jurisdiction should extend to additional parties, regardless of an ensuing lack of diversity.  This is the position taken by the commentators, Shulman and Jaegerman, Some Jurisdicti nal Limitations on Federal Procedure, supra, 45 Yale L.J. 393, 418, and the few courts which have ruled on the question.  Carter Oil Co. v. Wood, supra, D.C. E.D. Ill., 30 F.Supp. 875;  King v. Edward B. Marks Music Corp., D.C.S.D.N.Y., 56 F.Supp. 446;  and see Black v. London Assur. Co. of London, England, D.C.W.D.S.C., 122 F.Supp. 330, where the court arrived at the desired result through realignment of the parties.  We ourselves have come to the same conclusion in the past on the similar issue of venue requirements for additional defendants, see Lesnik v. Public Industrials Corp., supra, 2 Cir., 144 F.2d 968, and with respect to impleader of third-party defendants under F.R. 14.  Friend v. Middle Atlantic Transp. Co., 2 Cir., 153 F.2d 778, 779-780, certiorari denied

A liberal attitude toward the inclusion of parties is a necessary concomitant to the liberalized third-party practice authorized by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  The presence of these defendants is necessary to a complete adjudication of the issues involved in this litigation, which should not be retried at another time in another forum."

    <p class="footnote"> The unwisdom of having "lumped together in iscriminately cases involving each of the three different contexts in which the question of pendent parties has been litigated" has been sufficiently criticised by Professors Wright, Miller, and Cooper. See their treatise on Federal Practice and Procedure &#xA7; 3567.2, pp. 152-153 (2d ed. 1984).  They explain:</p>
    <p class="footnote">"The distinctions are there and do not become less real because they are not mentioned.  The meaning of 'amount in controversy' in &#xA7; 1332 raises one question, the meaning of 'between citizens of different states' in the same statute raises a different question, and the permissible scope of cases 'arising under' federal law within the Constitution and &#xA7; 1331 raises still a third question.  The considerations for allowing 'pendent parties' in a federal question case may well be more compelling than for doing so when the only effect is to broaden the scope&#x97;and attractiveness&#x97;of diversity jurisdiction."</p>

    <p class="footnote"> "The continued need for exercise of diversity jurisdiction, at least where a showing of prejudice is not made, has been challenged by respected authorities.

Nor are any words needed to indicate submission to the law of the land.  The readiness or reluctance with which courts find such consent has naturally been influenced by prevailing views regarding the moral sanction to be attributed to a State's freedom from suability.  Whether this immunity is an absolute survival of the monarchial privilege, or is a manifestation merely of power, or rests on abstract legal grounds, it undoubtedly runs counter to modern democratic notions of the moral responsibility of the State.  Accordingly, courts reflect a strong legislative momentum in their tendency to extend the legal responsibility of Government and to confirm Maitland's belief, expressed nearly fifty years ago, that 'it is a wholesome sight to see "the Crown" sued and answering for its torts' ").</p>
