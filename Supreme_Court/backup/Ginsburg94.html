				Among other things, Connecticut&#x92;s &#x93;Megan&#x92;s Law&#x94; requires persons convicted of sexual offenses to register with the Department of Public Safety (DPS) upon their release into the community, and requires DPS to post a sex offender registry containing registrants&#x92; names, addresses, photographs, and descriptions on an Internet Website and to make the registry available to the public in certain state offices.

The Second Circuit affirmed, concluding that such disclosure both deprived registered sex offenders of a &#x93;liberty interest,&#x94; and violated the Due Process Clause because officials did not afford registrants a predeprivation hearing to determine whether they are likely to be &#x93;currently dangerous.&#x94;

The District Court granted summary judgment for respondent on his due process claim.  132 F. Supp. 2d 57 (Conn. 2001).

				The Court of Appeals affirmed, 271 F. 3d 38 (CA2 2001), holding that the Due Process Clause entitles class members to a hearing &#x93;to determine whether or not they are particularly likely to be currently dangerous before being labeled as such by their inclusion in a publicly disseminated registry.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>

Because Connecticut had not provided such a hearing, the Court of Appeals enjoined petitioners from &#x93; &#x91;disclosing or disseminating to the public, either in printed or electronic form (a) the Registry or (b) Registry information concerning [class members]&#x92; &#x94; and from &#x93; &#x91;identifying [them] as being included in the Registry.&#x92; &#x94;  
				<em>

				  The Court of Appeals reasoned that the Connecticut law implicated a &#x93;liberty interest&#x94; because of: (1) the law&#x92;s stigmatization of respondent by &#x93;implying&#x94; that he is &#x93;currently dangerous,&#x94; and (2) its imposition of &#x93;extensive and onerous&#x94; registration obligations on respondent.

, we held that due process required the government to accord the plaintiff a hearing to prove or disprove a particular fact or set of facts.  But in each of these cases, the fact in question was concededly relevant to the inquiry at hand.  Here, however, the fact that respondent seeks to prove&#x97;that he is not currently dangerous&#x97;is of no consequence under Connecticut&#x92;s Megan&#x92;s Law.  As the DPS Website explains, the law&#x92;s requirements turn on an offender&#x92;s conviction alone&#x97;a fact that a convicted offender has already had a procedurally safeguarded opportunity to contest.  271 F. 3d, at 44 (&#x93; &#x91;Individuals included within the registry are included 
				<em>
					solely
				</em>
				 by virtue of their conviction record and state law&#x92; &#x94; (emphasis added)).  No other fact is relevant to the disclosure of registrants&#x92; information.  Conn. Gen. Stat. &#xA7;&#xA7;54&#x96;257, 54&#x96;258 (2001).  Indeed, the disclaimer on the Website explicitly states that respondent&#x92;s alleged nondangerousness simply does not matter.  271 F. 3d, at 44 (&#x93; &#x91;[DPS] has made no determination that any individual included in the registry is currently

				dangerous&#x92; &#x94;).

				In short, even if respondent could prove that he is not likely to be currently dangerous, Connecticut has decided that the registry information of

				The Court of Appeals affirmed, 271 F. 3d 38 (CA2 2001), holding that the Due Process Clause entitles class members to a hearing &#x93;to determine whether or not they are particularly likely to be currently dangerous before being labeled as such by their inclusion in a publicly disseminated registry.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.,
				</em>
				 at 62.  Because Connecticut had not provided such a hearing, the Court of Appeals enjoined petitioners from &#x93; &#x91;disclosing or disseminating to the public, either in printed or electronic form (a) the Registry or (b) Registry information concerning [class members]&#x92; &#x94; and from &#x93; &#x91;identifying [them] as being included in the Registry.&#x92; &#x94;  
				<em>

				  The Court of Appeals reasoned that the Connecticut law implicated a &#x93;liberty interest&#x94; because of: (1) the law&#x92;s stigmatization of respondent by &#x93;implying&#x94; that he is &#x93;currently dangerous,&#x94; and (2) its imposition of &#x93;extensive and onerous&#x94; registration obligations on respondent.  
				<em>
					Id.,

Here, however, the fact that respondent seeks to prove&#x97;that he is not currently dangerous&#x97;is of no consequence under Connecticut&#x92;s Megan&#x92;s Law.  As the DPS Website explains, the law&#x92;s requirements turn on an offender&#x92;s conviction alone&#x97;a fact that a convicted offender has already had a procedurally safeguarded opportunity to contest.  271 F. 3d, at 44 (&#x93; &#x91;Individuals included within the registry are included

				In short, even if respondent could prove that he is not likely to be currently dangerous, Connecticut has decided that the registry information of

				We granted certiorari to determine whether the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit properly enjoined the public disclosure of Connecticut&#x92;s sex offender registry.  The Court of Appeals concluded that such disclosure both deprived registered sex offenders of a &#x93;liberty interest,&#x94; and violated the Due Process Clause because officials did not afford registrants a predeprivation hearing to determine whether they are likely to be &#x93;currently dangerous.&#x94;

				271 F. 3d 38, 44, 46 (2001).  Connecticut, however, has decided that the registry requirement shall be based on the fact of previous conviction, not the fact of current dangerousness.  Indeed, the public registry explicitly states that officials have not determined that any registrant is currently dangerous.  We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals because due process does not require the opportunity to prove a fact that is not material to the State&#x92;s statutory scheme.

Connecticut, like every other State, has responded to these facts by enacting a statute designed to protect its communities from sex offenders and to help apprehend repeat sex offenders.  Connecticut&#x92;s &#x93;Megan&#x92;s Law&#x94; applies to all persons convicted of criminal offenses against a minor, violent and nonviolent sexual offenses, and felonies committed for a sexual purpose.  Covered offenders must register with the Connecticut Department of Public Safety (DPS) upon their release into the community.  Each must provide personal information (including his name, address, photograph, and DNA sample); notify DPS of any change in residence; and periodically submit an updated photograph.  The registration requirement runs for 10 years in most cases; those convicted of sexually violent offenses must register for life.  Conn. Gen. Stat. &#xA7;&#xA7;54&#x96;251, 54&#x96;252, 54&#x96;254 (2001).
