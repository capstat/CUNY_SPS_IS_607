    <p class="pro-indent">Respondent Oxford House operates a group home in Edmonds, Washington, for 10 to 12 adults recovering from alcoholism and drug addiction in a neighborhood zoned for single-family residences. Petitioner City of Edmonds issued citations to the owner and a resident of the house, charging violation of the City's zoning code. The code provides that the occupants of single-family dwelling units must compose a "family," and defines family as "persons without regard to number related by genetics, adoption, or marriage, or a group of five or fewer unrelated persons." Edmonds Community Development Code (ECDC) &#xA7; 21.30.010. Oxford House asserted reliance on the Fair Housing Act (FHA), which prohibits discrimination in housing against, inter alios, persons with handicaps. Discrimination covered by the FHA includes "a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling." 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3604#f_3_B" class="subref" title="42 U.S.C. 3604(f)(3)(B)">42 U.S.C. 3604(f)(3)(B)</a>. Edmonds subsequently sued Oxford House in federal court, seeking a declaration that the FHA does not constrain the City's zoning code family definition rule. Oxford House counterclaimed under the FHA, charging the City with failure to make a "reasonable accommodation" permitting the maintenance of the group home in a single-family zone. Respondent United States filed a separate action on the same FHA-"reasonable accommodation" ground, and the cases were consolidated. The District Court held that the City's zoning code rule defining "family," ECDC &#xA7; 21.30.010, is exempt from the FHA under 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3607#b_1" class="subref" title="42 U.S.C. 3607(b)(1)">42 U.S.C. 3607(b)(1)</a> as a "reasonable . . . restriction regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling." The Court of Appeals reversed, holding &#xA7; 3607(b)(1)'s absolute exemption inapplicable.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Held: Edmonds' zoning code definition of the term "family" is not a maximum occupancy restriction exempt from the FHA under &#xA7; 3607(b)(1). Pp. __.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">(a) Congress enacted &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) against the backdrop of an evident distinction between municipal land use restrictions and maximum occupancy restrictions. Land use restrictions designate districts&#x97;e.g., commercial or single-family residential &#x97;in which only compatible uses are allowed and incompatible uses are excluded. Reserving land for single-family residences preserves the character of neighborhoods as family residential communities. To limit land use to single-family residences, a municipality must define the term "family"; thus family composition rules are an essential component of single-family use restrictions. Maximum occupancy restrictions, in contradistinction, cap the number of occupants per dwelling, typically on the basis of available floor space or rooms. Their purpose is to protect health and safety by preventing dwelling overcrowding. Section 3607(b)(1)'s language "restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling"&#x97;surely encompasses maximum occupancy restrictions, and does not fit family composition rules typically tied to land use restrictions. Pp. __.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">(b) The zoning provisions Edmonds invoked against Oxford House, ECDC &#xA7;&#xA7; 16.20.010 and 21.30.010, are classic examples of a use restriction and complementing family composition rule. These provisions do not cap the number of people who may live in a dwelling: So long as they are related by "genetics, adoption, or marriage," any number of people can live in a house. A separate ECDC provision&#x97;&#xA7; 19.10.000 &#x97;caps the number of occupants a dwelling may house, based on floor area, and is thus a prototypical maximum occupancy restriction. In short, the City's family definition rule, ECDC &#xA7; 21.30.010, describes family living, not living space per occupant. Defining family primarily by biological and legal relationships, the rule also accommodates another group association: five or fewer unrelated people are allowed to live together as though they were family. But this accommodation cannot convert Edmonds' family values preserver into a maximum occupancy restriction. Edmonds' contention that subjecting single-family zoning to FHA scrutiny will overturn Euclidian zoning and destroy the effectiveness and purpose of single-family zoning both ignores the limited scope of the issue before this Court and exaggerates the force of the FHA's antidiscrimination provisions, which require only "reasonable" accommodations. Since only a threshold question is presented in this case, it remains for the lower courts to decide whether Edmonds' actions violate the FHA's prohibitions against discrimination. Pp. __.</p>

    <p class="pro-indent">The Fair Housing Act (FHA or Act) prohibits discrimination in housing against, inter alios, persons with handicaps.<a name="fn1_ref" href="#fn1" class="">

        </a> Section 3607(b)(1) of the Act entirely exempts from the FHA's compass "any reasonable local, State, or Federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling." 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3607#b_1" class="subref" title="42 U.S.C. 3607(b)(1)">42 U.S.C. 3607(b)(1)</a>. This case presents the question whether a provision in petitioner City of Edmonds' zoning code qualifies for &#xA7; 3607(b)(1)'s complete exemption from FHA scrutiny. The provision, governing areas zoned for single-family dwelling units, defines "family" as "persons without regard to number related by genetics, adoption, or marriage, or a group of five or fewer unrelated persons." Edmonds Community Development Code (ECDC) &#xA7; 21.30.010 (1991).</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">The defining provision at issue describes who may compose a family unit; it does not prescribe "the maximum number of occupants" a dwelling unit may house. We hold that &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) does not exempt prescriptions of the family-defining kind, i.e., provisions designed to foster the family character of a neighborhood. Instead, &#xA7; 3607(b)(1)'s absolute exemption removes from the FHA's scope only total occupancy limits, i.e., numerical ceilings that serve to prevent overcrowding in living quarters.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">* In the summer of 1990, respondent Oxford House opened a group home in the City of Edmonds, Washington for 10 to 12 adults recovering from alcoholism and drug addiction. The group home, called Oxford House-Edmonds, is located in a neighborhood zoned for single-family residences. Upon learning that Oxford House had leased and was operating a home in Edmonds, the City issued criminal citations to the owner and a resident of the house. The citations charged violation of the zoning code rule that defines who may live in single-family dwelling units. The occupants of such units must compose a "family," and family, under the City's defining rule, "means an individual or two or more persons related by genetics, adoption, or marriage, or a group of five or fewer persons who are not related by genetics, adoption, or marriage." Edmonds Community Development Code (ECDC) &#xA7; 21.30.010. Oxford House-Edmonds houses more than five unrelated persons, and therefore does not conform to the code.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Oxford House asserted reliance on the Fair Housing Act, 
102 Stat. 1619, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3601" class="subref" title="42 U.S.C. 3601">42 U.S.C. 3601</a> et seq., which declares it unlawful "to discriminate in the sale or rental, or to otherwise make unavailable or deny, a dwelling to any buyer or renter because of a handicap of . . . that buyer or a renter." &#xA7; 3604(f)(1)(A). The parties have stipulated, for purposes of this litigation, that the residents of Oxford House-Edmonds "are recovering alcoholics and drug addicts and are handicapped persons within the meaning" of the Act. App. 106.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Discrimination covered by the FHA includes "a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford handicapped persons equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling." &#xA7; 3604(f)(3)(B). Oxford House asked Edmonds to make a "reasonable accommodation" by allowing it to remain in the single-family dwelling it had leased. Group homes for recovering substance abusers, Oxford urged, need 8 to 12 residents to be financially and therapeutically viable. Edmonds declined to permit Oxford House to stay in a single-family residential zone, but passed an ordinance listing group homes as permitted uses in multifamily and general commercial zones.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Edmonds sued Oxford House in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington seeking a declaration that the FHA does not constrain the City's zoning code family definition rule. Oxford House counterclaimed under the FHA, charging the City with failure to make a "reasonable accommodation" permitting maintenance of the group home in a single-family zone. The United States filed a separate action on the same FHA-"reasonable accommodation" ground, and the two cases were consolidated. Edmonds suspended its criminal enforcement actions pending resolution of the federal litigation.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court held that ECDC &#xA7; 21.30.010, defining "family," is exempt from the FHA under &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) as a "reasonable . . . restriction regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling." App. to Pet. for Cert. B-7. The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed; holding &#xA7; 3607(b)(1)'s absolute exemption inapplicable, the Court of Appeals remanded the cases for further consideration of the claims asserted by Oxford House and the United States. Edmonds v. Washington State Building Code Council, 18 F.3d 802 (1994).</p>

Mandelker, Land Use Law &#xA7; 4.16, pp. 113-114 (3d ed.1993) (hereinafter Mandelker). These restrictions typically categorize uses as single-family residential, multiple-family residential, commercial, or industrial. See, e.g., 1 E. Ziegler, Jr., Rathkopf's The Law of Zoning and Planning &#xA7; 8.01, pp. 8-2 to 8-3 (4th ed.1995); Mandelker &#xA7; 1.03, p. 4; 1 E.

    <p class="pro-indent">Maximum occupancy restrictions, in contradistinction, cap the number of occupants per dwelling, typically in relation to available floor space or the number and type of rooms.

    <p class="pro-indent">We recognized this distinction between maximum occupancy restrictions and land use restrictions in Moore v. City of East Cleveland,

In Moore, the Court held unconstitutional the constricted definition of "family" contained in East Cleveland's housing ordinance. East Cleveland's ordinance "selected certain categories of relatives who may live together and declared that others may not"; in particular, East Cleveland's definition of "family" made "a crime of a grandmother's choice to live with her grandson." 
Id., at 498-499, 97 S.Ct., at 1935 (plurality opinion). In response to East Cleveland's argument that its aim was to prevent overcrowded dwellings, streets, and schools, we observed that the municipality's restrictive definition of family served the asserted, and undeniably legitimate, goals "marginally, at best." 
Id., at 500, 97 S.Ct., at 1936 (footnote omitted). Another East Cleveland ordinance, we noted, "specifically addressed . . . the problem of overcrowding"; that ordinance tied "the maximum permissible occupancy of a dwelling to the habitable floor area."

    <p class="pro-indent">Turning specifically to the City's Community Development Code, we note that the provisions Edmonds invoked against Oxford House, ECDC &#xA7;&#xA7; 16.20.010 and 21.30.010, are classic examples of a use restriction and complementing family composition rule. These provisions do not cap the number of people who may live in a dwelling. In plain terms, they direct that dwellings be used only to house families. Captioned "USES," ECDC &#xA7; 16.20.010 provides that the sole "Permitted Primary Use" in a single-family residential zone is "single-family dwelling units." Edmonds itself recognizes that this provision simply "defines those uses permitted in a single family residential zone." Pet. for Cert. 3.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">A separate provision caps the number of occupants a dwelling may house, based on floor area:</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">"Floor Area. Every dwelling unit shall have at least one room which shall have not less than 120 square feet of floor area. Other habitable rooms, except kitchens, shall have an area of not less than 70 square feet. Where more than two persons occupy a room used for sleeping purposes, the required floor area shall be increased at the rate of 50 square feet for each occupant in excess of two." ECDC &#xA7; 19.10.000 (adopting Uniform Housing Code &#xA7; 503(b) (1988)).<a name="fn10_ref" href="#fn10" class="">

        </a>
    </p>
    <p class="pro-indent">This space and occupancy standard is a prototypical maximum occupancy restriction.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Edmonds nevertheless argues that its family composition rule, ECDC &#xA7; 21.30.010, falls within &#xA7; 3607(b)(1), the FHA exemption for maximum occupancy restrictions, because the rule caps at five the number of unrelated persons allowed to occupy a single-family dwelling. But Edmonds' family composition rule surely does not answer the question: "What is the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a house?" So long as they are related "by genetics, adoption, or marriage," any number of people can live in a house. Ten siblings, their parents and grandparents, for example, could dwell in a house in Edmonds' single-family residential zone without offending Edmonds' family composition rule.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Family living, not living space per occupant, is what ECDC &#xA7; 21.30.010 describes. Defining family primarily by biological and legal relationships, the provision also accommodates another group association: five or fewer unrelated people are allowed to live together as though they were family. This accommodation is the peg on which Edmonds rests its plea for &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) exemption. Had the City defined a family solely by biological and legal links, &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) would not have been the ground on which Edmonds staked its case. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 11-12, 16. It is curious reasoning indeed that converts a family values preserver into a maximum occupancy restriction once a town adds to a related persons prescription "and also two unrelated persons."<a name="fn11_ref" href="#fn11" class="">

    <p class="pro-indent">Edmonds additionally contends that subjecting single-family zoning to FHA scrutiny will "overturn Euclidian zoning" and "destroy the effectiveness and purpose of single-family zoning." Brief for Petitioner 11, 25. This contention both ignores the limited scope of the issue before us and exaggerates the force of the FHA's antidiscrimination provisions. We address only whether Edmonds' family composition rule qualifies for &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) exemption. Moreover, the FHA antidiscrimination provisions, when applicable, require only "reasonable" accommodations to afford persons with handicaps "equal opportunity to use and enjoy" housing. &#xA7;&#xA7; 3604(f)(1)(A) and (f)(3)(B).</p>

    <p class="pro-indent">Congress has exempted from the requirements of the Fair Housing Act (FHA) "any reasonable local, State, or Federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling." 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3607#b_1" class="subref" title="42 U.S.C. 3607(b)(1)">42 U.S.C. 3607(b)(1)</a> (emphasis added). In today's decision, the Court concludes that the challenged provisions of petitioner's zoning code do not qualify for this exemption, even though they establish a specific number&#x97;five &#x97;as the maximum number of unrelated persons permitted to occupy a dwelling in the single-family neighborhoods of Edmonds, Washington. Because the Court's conclusion fails to give effect to the plain language of the statute, I respectfully dissent.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">* Petitioner's zoning code reserves certain neighborhoods primarily for "single-family dwelling units." Edmonds Community Development Code (ECDC) &#xA7; 16.20.010(A)(1) (1991), App. 225. To live together in such a dwelling, a group must constitute a "family," which may be either a traditional kind of family, comprising "two or more persons related by genetics, adoption, or marriage," or a nontraditional one, comprising "a group of five or fewer persons who are not so related." &#xA7; 21.30.010, App. 250. As respondent United States conceded at oral argument, the effect of these provisions is to establish a rule that "no house in a single-family area of the city shall have more than five occupants unless it is a traditional kind of family." Tr. of Oral Arg. 46. In other words, petitioner's zoning code establishes for certain dwellings "a five-occupant limit, with an exception for traditional families." Ibid.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">To my mind, the rule that "no house . . . shall have more than five occupants" (a "five-occupant limit") readily qualifies as a "restriction regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling." In plain fashion, it "restricts"&#x97;to five &#x97;"the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling." To be sure, as the majority observes, the restriction imposed by petitioner's zoning code is not an absolute one, because it does not apply to related persons. See ante, at __. But &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) does not set forth a narrow exemption only for "absolute" or "unqualified" restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants. Instead, it sweeps broadly to exempt any restrictions regarding such maximum number. It is difficult to imagine what broader terms Congress could have used to signify the categories or kinds of relevant governmental restrictions that are exempt from the FHA.<a name="fn1-1_ref" href="#fn1-1" class="">

    <p class="pro-indent">Consider a real estate agent who is assigned responsibility for the city of Edmonds. Desiring to learn all he can about his new territory, the agent inquires: "Does the city have any restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling?" The accurate answer must surely be in the affirmative&#x97;yes, the maximum number of unrelated persons permitted to occupy a dwelling in a single-family neighborhood is five. Or consider a different example. Assume that the Federal Republic of Germany imposes no restrictions on the speed of "cars" that drive on the Autobahn but does cap the speed of "trucks" (which are defined as all other vehicles). If a conscientious visitor to Germany asks whether there are "any restrictions regarding the maximum speed of motor vehicles permitted to drive on the Autobahn," the accurate answer again is surely the affirmative one&#x97;yes, there is a restriction regarding the maximum speed of trucks on the Autobahn.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">The majority does not ask whether petitioner's zoning code imposes any restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling. Instead, observing that pursuant to ECDC &#xA7; 21.30.010, "any number of people can live in a house," so long as they are "related 'by genetics, adoption, or marriage.' " the majority concludes that &#xA7; 21.30.010 does not qualify for &#xA7; 3607(b)(1)'s exemption because it "surely does not answer the question: 'What is the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a house?' " Ante, at __. The majority's question, however, does not accord with the text of the statute. To take advantage of the exemption, a local, state, or federal law need not impose a restriction establishing an absolute maximum number of occupants; under &#xA7; 3607(b)(1), it is necessary only that such law impose a restriction "regarding" the maximum number of occupants. Surely, a restriction can "regard"&#x97;or "concern," "relate to," or "bear on"&#x97;the maximum number of occupants without establishing an absolute maximum number in all cases.<a name="fn2-1_ref" href="#fn2-1" class="">

    <p class="pro-indent">As an initial matter, I do not agree with the majority's interpretive premise that "this case is an instance in which an exception to 'a general statement of policy' is sensibly read 'narrowly in order to preserve the primary operation of the policy.'

Why this case? Surely, it is not because the FHA has a "policy"; every statute has that. Nor could the reason be that a narrow reading of &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) is necessary to preserve the primary operation of the FHA's stated policy "to provide . . . for fair housing throughout the United States."

Congress, the body responsible for deciding how specifically to achieve the objective of fair housing, obviously believed that &#xA7; 3607(b)(1)'s exemption for "any . . . restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling" is consistent with the FHA's general statement of policy.

In concluding that state judges fell within this exemption, we did not construe it "narrowly" in order to preserve the "primary operation" of the ADEA. Instead, we specifically said that we were "not looking for a plain statement that judges are excluded" from the Act's coverage. Gregory,

    <p class="pro-indent">Behind our refusal in Gregory to give a narrow construction to the ADEA's exemption for "appointees on the policymaking level" was our holding that the power of Congress to "legislate in areas traditionally regulated by the States" is "an extraordinary power in a federalist system," and "a power that we must assume Congress does not exercise lightly."

    <p class="pro-para">B</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">I turn now to the substance of the majority's analysis, the focus of which is "maximum occupancy restrictions" and "family composition rules." The first of these two terms has the sole function of serving as a label for a category of zoning rules simply invented by the majority: rules that "cap the number of occupants per dwelling, typically in relation to available floor space or the number and type of rooms," that "ordinarily apply uniformly to all residents of all dwelling units," and that have the "purpose . . . to protect health and safety by preventing dwelling overcrowding." Ante, at __.<a name="fn5-1_ref" href="#fn5-1" class="">
            <sup>
                <b>5</b>
            </sup>
        </a> The majority's term does bear a familial resemblance to the statutory term "restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling," but it should be readily apparent that the category of zoning rules the majority labels "maximum occupancy restrictions" does not exhaust the category of restrictions exempted from the FHA by &#xA7; 3607(b)(1). The plain words of the statute do not refer to "available floor space or the number and type of rooms"; they embrace no requirement that the exempted restrictions "apply uniformly to all residents of all dwelling units"; and they give no indication that such restrictions must have the "purpose . . . to protect health and safety by preventing dwelling overcrowding." Ibid.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Of course, the majority does not contend that the language of &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) precisely describes the category of zoning rules it has labeled "maximum occupancy restrictions." Rather, the majority makes the far more narrow claim that the statutory language "surely encompasses" that category. Ante, at __. I readily concede this point.<a name="fn6-1_ref" href="#fn6-1" class="">
            <sup>
                <b>6</b>
            </sup>
        </a> But the obvious conclusion that &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) encompasses "maximum occupancy restrictions" tells us nothing about whether the statute also encompasses ECDC &#xA7; 21.30.010, the zoning rule at issue here. In other words, although the majority's discussion will no doubt provide guidance in future cases, it is completely irrelevant to the question presented in this case.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">The majority fares no better in its treatment of "family composition rules," a term employed by the majority to describe yet another invented category of zoning restrictions. Although today's decision seems to hinge on the majority's judgment that ECDC &#xA7; 21.30.010 is a "classic example of a . . . family composition rule," ante, at __, the majority says virtually nothing about this crucial category. Thus, it briefly alludes to the derivation of "family composition rules" and provides a single example of them.<a name="fn7-1_ref" href="#fn7-1" class="">
            <sup>
                <b>7</b>
            </sup>
        </a> Apart from these two references, however, the majority's analysis consists solely of announcing its conclusion that "the formulation of &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) does not fit family composition rules." Ante, at __. This is not reasoning; it is ipse dixit. Indeed, it is not until after this conclusion has been announced that the majority (in the course of summing up) even defines "family composition rules" at all. See ibid. (referring to "rules designed to preserve the family character of a neighborhood, fastening on the composition of households rather than on the total number of occupants living quarters can contain").</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Although the majority does not say so explicitly, one might infer from its belated definition of "family composition rules" that &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) does not encompass zoning rules that have one particular purpose ("to preserve the family character of a neighborhood") or those that refer to the qualitative as well as the quantitative character of a dwelling (by "fastening on the composition of households rather than on the total number of occupants living quarters can contain"). Ibid. Yet terms like "family character," "composition of households," "total that is, absolute number of occupants," and "living quarters" are noticeably absent from the text of the statute. Section 3607(b)(1) limits neither the permissible purposes of a qualifying zoning restriction nor the ways in which such a restriction may accomplish its purposes. Rather, the exemption encompasses "any" zoning restriction&#x97;whatever its purpose and by whatever means it accomplishes that purpose&#x97;so long as the restriction "regards" the maximum number of occupants. See generally supra, at __. As I have explained, petitioner's zoning code does precisely that.<a name="fn8-1_ref" href="#fn8-1" class="">

    </p>
    <p class="pro-indent">In sum, it does not matter that ECDC &#xA7; 21.030.010 describes "family living, not living space per occupant," ante, at __, because it is immaterial under &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) whether &#xA7; 21.030.010 constitutes a "family composition rule" but not a "maximum occupancy restriction." The sole relevant question is whether petitioner's zoning code imposes "any . . . restrictions regarding the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling." Because I believe it does, I respectfully dissent.</p>

See supra, at __, n. 1.  The provision making it illegal to discriminate in housing against families with children under the age of 18 prompted fears that landlords would be forced to allow large families to crowd into small housing units.  See, e.g., Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988:  Hearings on H.R. 1158 before the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 100th Cong., 1st Sess., 656 (1987) (remarks of Rep. Edwards) (questioning whether a landlord must allow a family with 10 children to live in a two-bedroom apartment).  Section 3607(b)(1) makes it plain that, pursuant to local prescriptions on maximum occupancy, landlords legitimately may refuse to stuff large families into small quarters.  Congress further assured in &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) that retirement communities would be exempt from the proscription of discrimination against families with minor children.  In the sentence immediately following the maximum occupancy provision, &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) states:  "Nor does any provision in this subchapter regarding familial status apply with respect to housing for older persons."</p>

If Edmonds allowed only related persons (whatever their number) to dwell in a house in a single-family zone, then the dissent, it appears, would agree that the &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) exemption is unavailable.  But so long as the City introduces a specific number&#x97;any number (two will do) the City can insulate its single-family zone entirely from FHA coverage.  The exception-takes-the-rule reading the dissent advances is hardly the "generous construction" warranted for antidiscrimination prescriptions.  See Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,

114 S.Ct. 517, 524, 126 L.Ed.2d 524 (1993) (citing, as examples where "Congress spoke without qualification" in ERISA, an exemption for " 'any security' issued to a plan by a registered investment company" and an exemption for " 'any assets of . . . an insurance company or any assets of a plan which are held by . . . an insurance company' " (quoting

    <p class="footnote"> It is ironic that the majority cites Uniform Housing Code &#xA7; 503(b) (1988), which has been incorporated into petitioner's zoning code, see ECDC &#xA7; 19.10.000, App. 248, as a "prototypical maximum occupancy restriction" that would qualify for &#xA7; 3607(b)(1)'s exemption.  Ante, at __.  Because &#xA7; 503(b), as the majority describes it, "caps the number of occupants a dwelling may house, based on floor area," ante, at __ (emphasis added), it actually caps the density of occupants, not their number.  By itself, therefore, &#xA7; 503(b) "surely does not answer the question: 'What is the maximum number of occupants permitted to occupy a house?' "  Ante, at __.  That is, even under &#xA7; 503(b), there is no single absolute maximum number of occupants that applies to every house in Edmonds.  Thus, the answer to the majority's question is the same with respect to both &#xA7; 503(b) and ECDC &#xA7; 21.30.010:  "it depends."  With respect to the former, it depends on the size of the house's bedrooms, see ibid. (quoting &#xA7; 503(b));  with respect to the latter, it depends on whether the house's occupants are related.</p>

        <a class="fnflag" name="fn3-1" href="#fn3-1_ref">3</a>
    </p>
    <p class="footnote"> I would also remand the case to the Court of Appeals to allow it to pass on respondents' argument that petitioner's zoning code does not satisfy &#xA7; 3607(b)(1)'s requirement that qualifying restrictions be "reasonable."  The District Court rejected this argument, concluding that petitioner's "five-unrelated-person limit is reasonable as a matter of law," App. to Pet. for Cert. B-10, but the Court of Appeals did not address the issue.</p>

    <p class="footnote"> The majority notes "precedent recognizing the FHA's 'broad and inclusive' compass, and therefore according a 'generous construction' to the Act's complaint-filing provision."  Ante, at __ (quoting Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/409/205" class="subref" title="409 U.S. 205, 209, 212, 93 S.Ct. 364, 366-367, 368, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972)">409 U.S. 205, 209, 212, 93 S.Ct. 364, 366-367, 368, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972)</a>). What we actually said in Trafficante was that "[t]he language of the Act is broad and inclusive."  Id., at 209, 93 S.Ct., at 367. This is true enough, but we did not "therefore" accord a generous construction either to the FHA's "antidiscrimination prescriptions," see ante, at __, n. 11, or to its complaint-filing provision, &#xA7; 810(a), 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3610#a" class="subref" title="42 U.S.C. 3610(a)">42 U.S.C. 3610(a)</a> (1970 ed.) (repealed 1988).  Instead, without any reference to the language of the Act, we stated that we could "give vitality to &#xA7; 810(a) only by a generous construction which gives standing to sue to all in the same housing unit who are injured by racial discrimination in the management of those facilities within the coverage of the statute." 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/409/0" class="subref" title="409 U.S., at 212, 93 S.Ct., at 368">409 U.S., at 212, 93 S.Ct., at 368</a>.  If we were to apply such logic to this case, we would presumably "give vitality" to &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) by giving it a generous rather than a narrow construction.</p>

    <p class="footnote"> To my knowledge, no federal or state judicial opinion other than three &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) decisions dating from 1992 and 1993 employs the term "maximum occupancy restrictions."  Likewise, not one of the model codes from which the majority constructs its category of zoning rules uses that term either.  See ante, at ___ (citing authorities).  Accordingly, it is difficult to conceive how Congress, in 1988, could have "enacted &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) against the backdrop of an evident distinction between municipal land use restrictions and maximum occupancy restrictions."  Ante, at __.</p>
    <p class="footnote">In this context, the majority seizes on a phrase that appears in a booklet published jointly by the American Public Health Association and the Centers for Disease Control&#x97;" 'the maximum number of individuals permitted to reside in a dwelling unit, or rooming unit.' "  Ante, at __, n. 6 (quoting APHA-CDC Recommended Minimum Housing Standards &#xA7; 2.51, p. 12 (1986)).  Even if, as the majority boldly asserts, this phrase "bears a marked resemblance to the formulation Congress used in &#xA7; 3607(b)(1)," ibid., I fail to comprehend how that would add to our understanding of the statute.  The majority surely cannot hope to invoke the rule that where " 'Congress borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the body of learning from which it was taken and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed.'

    <p class="footnote"> All that remains of the majority's case is the epithet that my reasoning is "curious" because it yields an "exception-takes-the-rule reading" of &#xA7; 3607(b)(1).  Ante, at __, n. 11.  It is not clear why the majority thinks my reading will eviscerate the FHA's antidiscrimination prescriptions.  The Act protects handicapped persons from traditionally defined (intentional) discrimination, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/3604#f_1" class="subref" title="42 U.S.C. 3604(f)(1)">42 U.S.C. 3604(f)(1)</a>, (2), and three kinds of specially defined discrimination:  "refusal to permit . . . reasonable modifications of existing premises";  "refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services";  and "failure to design and construct [multifamily] dwellings" such that they are accessible and usable, &#xA7; 3604(f)(3)(A), (B), (C).  Yet only one of these four kinds of discrimination&#x97;the "reasonable accommodations" prescription of &#xA7; 3604(f)(3)(B)&#x97;is even arguably implicated by zoning rules like ECDC &#xA7; 21.30.010.  In addition, because the exemption refers to "local, State, or Federal restrictions," even the broadest reading of &#xA7; 3607(b)(1) could not possibly insulate private refusals to make reasonable accommodations for handicapped persons.  Finally, as I have already noted, see n. 3, supra, restrictions must be "reasonable" in order to be exempted by &#xA7; 3607(b)(1).</p>
