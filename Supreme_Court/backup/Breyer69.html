				Police officers, with probable cause to believe that respondent McArthur had hidden marijuana in his home, prevented him from entering the home unaccompanied by an officer for about two hours while they obtained a search warrant.  Once they did so, the officers found drug paraphernalia and marijuana, and arrested McArthur.  He was subsequently charged with misdemeanor possession of those items.  He moved to suppress the evidence on the ground that it was the &#x93;fruit&#x94; of an unlawful police seizure, namely, the refusal to let him reenter his home unaccompanied.  The Illinois trial court granted the motion, and the State Appellate Court affirmed.

In light of the following circumstances, considered in combination, the Court concludes that the restriction was reasonable, and hence lawful.  First, the police had probable cause to believe that McArthur&#x92;s home contained evidence of a crime and unlawful drugs.  Second, they had good reason to fear that, unless restrained, he would destroy the drugs before they could return with a warrant.  Third, they made reasonable efforts to reconcile their law enforcement needs with the demands of personal privacy by avoiding  a warrantless entry or arrest and preventing McArthur only from entering his home unaccompanied.  Fourth, they imposed the restraint for a limited period, which was no longer than reasonably necessary for them, acting with diligence, to obtain the warrant.  Pp. 3&#x96;6.

				Police officers, with probable cause to believe that a man had hidden marijuana in his home, prevented that man from entering the home for about two hours while they obtained a search warrant.  We must decide whether those officers violated the

				On April 2, 1997, Tera McArthur asked two police officers to accompany her to the trailer where she lived with her husband, Charles, so that they could keep the peace while she removed her belongings.  The two officers, Assistant Chief John Love and Officer Richard Skidis, arrived with Tera at the trailer at about 3:15 p.m.  Tera went inside, where Charles was present.  The officers remained outside.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				When Tera emerged after collecting her possessions, she spoke to Chief Love, who was then on the porch.  She suggested he check the trailer because &#x93;Chuck had dope in there.&#x94;  App. 15.  She added (in Love&#x92;s words) that she had seen Chuck &#x93;slid[e] some dope underneath the couch.&#x94;

				, at 19.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Love knocked on the trailer door, told Charles what Tera had said, and asked for permission to search the trailer, which Charles denied.  Love then sent Officer Skidis with Tera to get a search warrant.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Love told Charles, who by this time was also on the porch, that he could not reenter the trailer unless a police officer accompanied him.  Charles subsequently reentered the trailer two or three times (to get cigarettes and to make phone calls), and each time Love stood just inside the door to observe what Charles did.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Officer Skidis obtained the warrant by about 5 p.m.  He returned to the trailer and, along with other officers, searched it.  The officers found under the sofa a marijuana pipe, a box for marijuana (called a &#x93;one-hitter&#x94; box), and a small amount of marijuana.  They then arrested Charles.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Illinois subsequently charged Charles McArthur with unlawfully possessing drug paraphernalia and marijuana (less than 2.5 grams), both misdemeanors.  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, &#xA7;&#xA7;550/4(a), 600/3.5(a) (1998).  McArthur moved to suppress the pipe, box, and marijuana on the ground that they were the &#x93;fruit&#x94; of an unlawful police seizure, namely, the refusal to let him reenter the trailer unaccompanied, which would have permitted him, he said, to &#x93;have destroyed the marijuana.&#x94;  App. 27.

        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The trial court granted McArthur&#x92;s suppression motion.  The Appellate Court of Illinois affirmed, 304 Ill. App. 3d 395, 713 N. E. 2d 93 (1999), and the Illinois Supreme Court denied the State&#x92;s petition for leave to appeal, 185 Ill. 2d 651, 720 N. E. 2d 1101 (1999).  We granted certiorari to determine whether the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> prohibits the kind of temporary seizure at issue here.

				The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> says that the &#x93;right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.&#x94;  U. S. Const., Amdt. 4.  Its &#x93;central requirement&#x94; is one of reasonableness.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">739</a> (1983)
.  In order to enforce that requirement, this Court has interpreted the Amendment as establishing rules and presumptions designed to control conduct of law enforcement officers that may significantly intrude upon privacy interests.  Sometimes those rules require warrants.  We have said, for example, that in &#x93;the ordinary case,&#x94; seizures of personal property are &#x93;unreasonable within the meaning of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>,&#x94; without more, &#x93;unless . . . accomplished pursuant to a judicial warrant,&#x94; issued by a neutral magistrate after finding probable cause.

 (&#x93; &#x91;[T]he chief evil against which the &#x2026;

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">313</a> (1972)

 (same).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We conclude that the restriction at issue was reasonable, and hence lawful, in light of the following circumstances, which we consider in combination.  First, the police had probable cause to believe that McArthur&#x92;s trailer home contained evidence of a crime and contraband, namely, unlawful drugs.  The police had had an opportunity to speak with Tera McArthur and make at least a very rough assessment of her reliability.  They knew she had had a firsthand opportunity to observe her husband&#x92;s behavior, in particular with respect to the drugs at issue.  And they thought, with good reason, that her report to them reflected that opportunity.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Massachusetts
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/727" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 727</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">732</a>&#x96;734 (1984)
<em>
					(per curiam)
				</em>
				 (upholding search warrant issued in similar circumstances).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the police had good reason to fear that, unless restrained, McArthur would destroy the drugs before they could return with a warrant.  They reasonably might have thought that McArthur realized that his wife knew about his marijuana stash; observed that she was angry or frightened enough to ask the police to accompany her; saw that after leaving the trailer she had spoken with the police; and noticed that she had walked off with one policeman while leaving the other outside to observe the trailer.  They reasonably could have concluded that McArthur, consequently suspecting an imminent search, would, if given the chance, get rid of the drugs fast.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the police made reasonable efforts to reconcile their law enforcement needs with the demands of personal privacy.  They neither searched the trailer nor arrested McArthur before obtaining a warrant.  Rather, they imposed a significantly less restrictive restraint, preventing McArthur only from entering the trailer unaccompanied.  They left his home and his belongings intact&#x97;until a neutral Magistrate, finding probable cause, issued a warrant.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Fourth, the police imposed the restraint for a limited period of time, namely, two hours.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Terry
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Ohio,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 28 (manner in which police act is &#x93;vital &#x2026; part of &#x2026; inquiry&#x94;).  As far as the record reveals, this time period was no longer than reasonably necessary for the police, acting with diligence, to obtain the warrant.  Compare 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Place, supra,
				</em>
				 at 709&#x96;710 (holding 90-minute detention of luggage unreasonable based on nature of interference with person&#x92;s travels and lack of diligence of police), with 
				<em>

				</em>
				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">253</a> (1970)
 (holding 29-hour detention of mailed package reasonable given unavoidable delay in obtaining warrant and minimal nature of intrusion).  Given the nature of the intrusion and the law enforcement interest at stake, this brief seizure of the premises was permissible.

        <p class="opcentered">

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Our conclusion that the restriction was lawful finds significant support in this Court&#x92;s case law.  In 
				<em>
					Segura

				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,

            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/468/796" class="subref" title="subref">468 U. S. 796</a> (1984)
, the Court considered the admissibility of drugs which the police had found in a lawful, warrant-based search of an apartment, but only after unlawfully entering the apartment and occupying it for 19 hours.  The majority held that the drugs were admissible because, had the police acted lawfully throughout, they could have discovered and seized the drugs pursuant to the validly issued warrant.  See 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 799, 814&#x96;815 (citing

).  The minority disagreed.  However, when describing alternative lawful search and seizure methods, both majority and minority assumed, at least for argument&#x92;s sake, that the police, armed with reliable information that the apartment contained drugs, might lawfully have sealed the apartment from the outside, restricting entry into the apartment while waiting for the warrant.  Compare

				We have found no case in which this Court has held unlawful a temporary seizure that was supported by probable cause and was designed to prevent the loss of evidence while the police diligently obtained a warrant in a reasonable period of time.  But cf. 
				<em>
					Welsh

				Nor are we persuaded by the countervailing considerations that the parties or lower courts have raised.  McArthur argues that the police proceeded without probable cause.  But McArthur has waived this argument.  See 304 Ill. App. 3d, at 397, 713 N. E. 2d, at 95 (stating that McArthur does not contest existence of probable cause); Brief in Opposition 7 (acknowledging probable cause).  And, in any event, it is without merit.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;5.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Appellate Court of Illinois concluded that the police could not order McArthur to stay outside his home because McArthur&#x92;s porch, where he stood at the time, was part of his home; hence the order &#x93;amounted to a constructive eviction&#x94; of McArthur from his residence.  304 Ill. App. 3d, at 402, 713 N. E. 2d, at 98.  This Court has held, however, that a person standing in the doorway of a house is &#x93;in a &#x91;public&#x92; place,&#x94; and hence subject to arrest without a warrant permitting entry of the home.  
				<em>
					United States

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">42</a> (1976)
.  Regardless, we do not believe the difference to which the Appellate Court points&#x97;porch versus, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 front walk&#x97;could make a significant difference here as to the reasonableness of the police restraint; and that, from the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>&#x92;s perspective, is what matters.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Appellate Court also found negatively significant the fact that Chief Love, with McArthur&#x92;s consent, stepped inside the trailer&#x92;s doorway to observe McArthur when McArthur reentered the trailer on two or three occasions.  304 Ill. App. 3d, at 402&#x96;403, 713 N. E. 2d, at 98.  McArthur, however, reentered simply for his own convenience, to make phone calls and to obtain cigarettes.  Under these circumstances, the reasonableness of the greater restriction (preventing reentry) implies the reasonableness of the lesser (permitting reentry conditioned on observation).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, McArthur points to a case (and we believe it is the only case) that he believes offers direct support, namely, 
				<em>
					Welsh
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Wisconsin, supra.
				</em>
				  In 
				<em>
					Welsh
				</em>
				, this Court held that police could not enter a home without a warrant in order to prevent the loss of evidence (namely, the defendant&#x92;s blood alcohol level) of the &#x93;nonjailable traffic offense&#x94; of driving while intoxicated.  466 U. S., at 742, 754.  McArthur notes that his two convictions are for misdemeanors, which, he says, are as minor, and he adds that the restraint, keeping him out of his home, was nearly as serious.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We nonetheless find significant distinctions.  The evidence at issue here was of crimes that were &#x93;jailable,&#x94; not &#x93;nonjailable.&#x94;  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, &#xA7;550/4(a) (1998); ch. 730, &#xA7;5/5&#x96;8&#x96;3(3) (possession of less than 2.5 grams of marijuana punishable by up to 30 days in jail); ch. 720, &#xA7;600/3.5; ch. 730, &#xA7;5/5&#x96;8&#x96;3(1) (possession of drug paraphernalia punishable by up to one year in jail).  In 
				<em>
					Welsh
				</em>
				, we noted that, &#x93;[g]iven that the classification of state crimes differs widely among the States, the penalty that may attach to any particular offense seems to provide the clearest and most consistent indication of the State&#x92;s interest in arresting individuals suspected of committing that offense.&#x94;  466 U. S., at 754, n. 14.  The same reasoning applies here, where class C misdemeanors include such widely diverse offenses as drag racing, drinking alcohol in a railroad car or on a railroad platform, bribery by a candidate for public office, and assault.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 65, &#xA7;5/4&#x96;8&#x96;2 (1998); ch. 610, &#xA7;90/1; ch. 625, &#xA7;5/11&#x96;504; ch. 720, &#xA7;5/12&#x96;1.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				And the restriction at issue here is less serious.  Temporarily keeping a person from entering his home, a consequence whenever police stop a person on the street, is considerably less intrusive than police entry into the home itself in order to make a warrantless arrest or conduct a search.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Payton
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					New York,
				</em>
				 445 U. S., at 585 (the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>&#x92;s central concern is the warrantless entry and search of the home).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We have explained above why we believe that the need to preserve evidence of a &#x93;jailable&#x94; offense was sufficiently urgent or pressing to justify the restriction upon entry that the police imposed.  We need not decide whether the circumstances before us would have justified a greater restriction for this type of offense or the same restriction were only a &#x93;nonjailable&#x94; offense at issue.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				In sum, the police officers in this case had probable cause to believe that a home contained contraband, which was evidence of a crime.  They reasonably believed that the home&#x92;s resident, if left free of any restraint, would destroy that evidence.  And they imposed a restraint that was both limited and tailored reasonably to secure law enforcement needs while protecting privacy interests.  In our view, the restraint met the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>&#x92;s demands.

				Police officers, with probable cause to believe that a man had hidden marijuana in his home, prevented that man from entering the home for about two hours while they obtained a search warrant.  We must decide whether those officers violated the

				On April 2, 1997, Tera McArthur asked two police officers to accompany her to the trailer where she lived with her husband, Charles, so that they could keep the peace while she removed her belongings.  The two officers, Assistant Chief John Love and Officer Richard Skidis, arrived with Tera at the trailer at about 3:15 p.m.  Tera went inside, where Charles was present.  The officers remained outside.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				When Tera emerged after collecting her possessions, she spoke to Chief Love, who was then on the porch.  She suggested he check the trailer because &#x93;Chuck had dope in there.&#x94;  App. 15.  She added (in Love&#x92;s words) that she had seen Chuck &#x93;slid[e] some dope underneath the couch.&#x94;  
				<em>

				, at 19.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Love knocked on the trailer door, told Charles what Tera had said, and asked for permission to search the trailer, which Charles denied.  Love then sent Officer Skidis with Tera to get a search warrant.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Love told Charles, who by this time was also on the porch, that he could not reenter the trailer unless a police officer accompanied him.  Charles subsequently reentered the trailer two or three times (to get cigarettes and to make phone calls), and each time Love stood just inside the door to observe what Charles did.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Officer Skidis obtained the warrant by about 5 p.m.  He returned to the trailer and, along with other officers, searched it.  The officers found under the sofa a marijuana pipe, a box for marijuana (called a &#x93;one-hitter&#x94; box), and a small amount of marijuana.  They then arrested Charles.

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Illinois subsequently charged Charles McArthur with unlawfully possessing drug paraphernalia and marijuana (less than 2.5 grams), both misdemeanors.  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, &#xA7;&#xA7;550/4(a), 600/3.5(a) (1998).  McArthur moved to suppress the pipe, box, and marijuana on the ground that they were the &#x93;fruit&#x94; of an unlawful police seizure, namely, the refusal to let him reenter the trailer unaccompanied, which would have permitted him, he said, to &#x93;have destroyed the marijuana.&#x94;  App. 27.

				The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> says that the &#x93;right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.&#x94;  U. S. Const., Amdt. 4.  Its &#x93;central requirement&#x94; is one of reasonableness.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">739</a> (1983)
.  In order to enforce that requirement, this Court has interpreted the Amendment as establishing rules and presumptions designed to control conduct of law enforcement officers that may significantly intrude upon privacy interests.  Sometimes those rules require warrants.  We have said, for example, that in &#x93;the ordinary case,&#x94; seizures of personal property are &#x93;unreasonable within the meaning of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>,&#x94; without more, &#x93;unless . . . accomplished pursuant to a judicial warrant,&#x94; issued by a neutral magistrate after finding probable cause.

				</em>
            <em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">585</a> (1980)
 (&#x93; &#x91;[T]he chief evil against which the &#x2026; 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> is directed&#x92; &#x94; is warrantless entry and search of home) (quoting

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">313</a> (1972)
).  Consequently, rather than employing a 
				<em>

				 rule of unreasonableness, we balance the privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns to determine if the intrusion was reasonable.  Cf.

 (same).

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We conclude that the restriction at issue was reasonable, and hence lawful, in light of the following circumstances, which we consider in combination.  First, the police had probable cause to believe that McArthur&#x92;s trailer home contained evidence of a crime and contraband, namely, unlawful drugs.  The police had had an opportunity to speak with Tera McArthur and make at least a very rough assessment of her reliability.  They knew she had had a firsthand opportunity to observe her husband&#x92;s behavior, in particular with respect to the drugs at issue.  And they thought, with good reason, that her report to them reflected that opportunity.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Massachusetts
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/727" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 727</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">732</a>&#x96;734 (1984)
<em>
					(per curiam)
				</em>
				 (upholding search warrant issued in similar circumstances).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the police had good reason to fear that, unless restrained, McArthur would destroy the drugs before they could return with a warrant.  They reasonably might have thought that McArthur realized that his wife knew about his marijuana stash; observed that she was angry or frightened enough to ask the police to accompany her; saw that after leaving the trailer she had spoken with the police; and noticed that she had walked off with one policeman while leaving the other outside to observe the trailer.  They reasonably could have concluded that McArthur, consequently suspecting an imminent search, would, if given the chance, get rid of the drugs fast.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the police made reasonable efforts to reconcile their law enforcement needs with the demands of personal privacy.  They neither searched the trailer nor arrested McArthur before obtaining a warrant.  Rather, they imposed a significantly less restrictive restraint, preventing McArthur only from entering the trailer unaccompanied.  They left his home and his belongings intact&#x97;until a neutral Magistrate, finding probable cause, issued a warrant.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Fourth, the police imposed the restraint for a limited period of time, namely, two hours.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Terry
				</em>
				 v.

, the Court considered the admissibility of drugs which the police had found in a lawful, warrant-based search of an apartment, but only after unlawfully entering the apartment and occupying it for 19 hours.  The majority held that the drugs were admissible because, had the police acted lawfully throughout, they could have discovered and seized the drugs pursuant to the validly issued warrant.  See

).  The minority disagreed.  However, when describing alternative lawful search and seizure methods, both majority and minority assumed, at least for argument&#x92;s sake, that the police, armed with reliable information that the apartment contained drugs, might lawfully have sealed the apartment from the outside, restricting entry into the apartment while waiting for the warrant.

				Nor are we persuaded by the countervailing considerations that the parties or lower courts have raised.  McArthur argues that the police proceeded without probable cause.  But McArthur has waived this argument.  See 304 Ill. App. 3d, at 397, 713 N. E. 2d, at 95 (stating that McArthur does not contest existence of probable cause); Brief in Opposition 7 (acknowledging probable cause).  And, in any event, it is without merit.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;5.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Appellate Court of Illinois concluded that the police could not order McArthur to stay outside his home because McArthur&#x92;s porch, where he stood at the time, was part of his home; hence the order &#x93;amounted to a constructive eviction&#x94; of McArthur from his residence.  304 Ill. App. 3d, at 402, 713 N. E. 2d, at 98.  This Court has held, however, that a person standing in the doorway of a house is &#x93;in a &#x91;public&#x92; place,&#x94; and hence subject to arrest without a warrant permitting entry of the home.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">42</a> (1976)
.  Regardless, we do not believe the difference to which the Appellate Court points&#x97;porch versus, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 front walk&#x97;could make a significant difference here as to the reasonableness of the police restraint; and that, from the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>&#x92;s perspective, is what matters.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Appellate Court also found negatively significant the fact that Chief Love, with McArthur&#x92;s consent, stepped inside the trailer&#x92;s doorway to observe McArthur when McArthur reentered the trailer on two or three occasions.  304 Ill. App. 3d, at 402&#x96;403, 713 N. E. 2d, at 98.  McArthur, however, reentered simply for his own convenience, to make phone calls and to obtain cigarettes.  Under these circumstances, the reasonableness of the greater restriction (preventing reentry) implies the reasonableness of the lesser (permitting reentry conditioned on observation).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, McArthur points to a case (and we believe it is the only case) that he believes offers direct support, namely, 
				<em>
					Welsh
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Wisconsin, supra.
				</em>
				  In 
				<em>
					Welsh
				</em>
				, this Court held that police could not enter a home without a warrant in order to prevent the loss of evidence (namely, the defendant&#x92;s blood alcohol level) of the &#x93;nonjailable traffic offense&#x94; of driving while intoxicated.  466 U. S., at 742, 754.  McArthur notes that his two convictions are for misdemeanors, which, he says, are as minor, and he adds that the restraint, keeping him out of his home, was nearly as serious.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We nonetheless find significant distinctions.  The evidence at issue here was of crimes that were &#x93;jailable,&#x94; not &#x93;nonjailable.&#x94;  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, &#xA7;550/4(a) (1998); ch. 730, &#xA7;5/5&#x96;8&#x96;3(3) (possession of less than 2.5 grams of marijuana punishable by up to 30 days in jail); ch. 720, &#xA7;600/3.5; ch. 730, &#xA7;5/5&#x96;8&#x96;3(1) (possession of drug paraphernalia punishable by up to one year in jail).  In 
				<em>
					Welsh
				</em>
				, we noted that, &#x93;[g]iven that the classification of state crimes differs widely among the States, the penalty that may attach to any particular offense seems to provide the clearest and most consistent indication of the State&#x92;s interest in arresting individuals suspected of committing that offense.&#x94;  466 U. S., at 754, n. 14.  The same reasoning applies here, where class C misdemeanors include such widely diverse offenses as drag racing, drinking alcohol in a railroad car or on a railroad platform, bribery by a candidate for public office, and assault.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 65, &#xA7;5/4&#x96;8&#x96;2 (1998); ch. 610, &#xA7;90/1; ch. 625, &#xA7;5/11&#x96;504; ch. 720, &#xA7;5/12&#x96;1.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				And the restriction at issue here is less serious.  Temporarily keeping a person from entering his home, a consequence whenever police stop a person on the street, is considerably less intrusive than police entry into the home itself in order to make a warrantless arrest or conduct a search.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Payton
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					New York,
				</em>
				 445 U. S., at 585 (the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>&#x92;s central concern is the warrantless entry and search of the home).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We have explained above why we believe that the need to preserve evidence of a &#x93;jailable&#x94; offense was sufficiently urgent or pressing to justify the restriction upon entry that the police imposed.  We need not decide whether the circumstances before us would have justified a greater restriction for this type of offense or the same restriction were only a &#x93;nonjailable&#x94; offense at issue.

				In sum, the police officers in this case had probable cause to believe that a home contained contraband, which was evidence of a crime.  They reasonably believed that the home&#x92;s resident, if left free of any restraint, would destroy that evidence.  And they imposed a restraint that was both limited and tailored reasonably to secure law enforcement needs while protecting privacy interests.  In our view, the restraint met the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>&#x92;s demands.

				Police officers, with probable cause to believe that a man had hidden marijuana in his home, prevented that man from entering the home for about two hours while they obtained a search warrant.  We must decide whether those officers violated the

				On April 2, 1997, Tera McArthur asked two police officers to accompany her to the trailer where she lived with her husband, Charles, so that they could keep the peace while she removed her belongings.  The two officers, Assistant Chief John Love and Officer Richard Skidis, arrived with Tera at the trailer at about 3:15 p.m.  Tera went inside, where Charles was present.  The officers remained outside.

				When Tera emerged after collecting her possessions, she spoke to Chief Love, who was then on the porch.  She suggested he check the trailer because &#x93;Chuck had dope in there.&#x94;  App. 15.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Love knocked on the trailer door, told Charles what Tera had said, and asked for permission to search the trailer, which Charles denied.  Love then sent Officer Skidis with Tera to get a search warrant.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Love told Charles, who by this time was also on the porch, that he could not reenter the trailer unless a police officer accompanied him.  Charles subsequently reentered the trailer two or three times (to get cigarettes and to make phone calls), and each time Love stood just inside the door to observe what Charles did.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Officer Skidis obtained the warrant by about 5 p.m.  He returned to the trailer and, along with other officers, searched it.  The officers found under the sofa a marijuana pipe, a box for marijuana (called a &#x93;one-hitter&#x94; box), and a small amount of marijuana.  They then arrested Charles.

				Illinois subsequently charged Charles McArthur with unlawfully possessing drug paraphernalia and marijuana (less than 2.5 grams), both misdemeanors.  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, &#xA7;&#xA7;550/4(a), 600/3.5(a) (1998).  McArthur moved to suppress the pipe, box, and marijuana on the ground that they were the &#x93;fruit&#x94; of an unlawful police seizure, namely, the refusal to let him reenter the trailer unaccompanied, which would have permitted him, he said, to &#x93;have destroyed the marijuana.&#x94;  App. 27.

				The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> says that the &#x93;right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.&#x94;  U.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">739</a> (1983)
.  In order to enforce that requirement, this Court has interpreted the Amendment as establishing rules and presumptions designed to control conduct of law enforcement officers that may significantly intrude upon privacy interests.  Sometimes those rules require warrants.  We have said, for example, that in &#x93;the ordinary case,&#x94; seizures of personal property are &#x93;unreasonable within the meaning of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>,&#x94; without more, &#x93;unless . . . accomplished pursuant to a judicial warrant,&#x94; issued by a neutral magistrate after finding probable cause.

				We conclude that the restriction at issue was reasonable, and hence lawful, in light of the following circumstances, which we consider in combination.  First, the police had probable cause to believe that McArthur&#x92;s trailer home contained evidence of a crime and contraband, namely, unlawful drugs.  The police had had an opportunity to speak with Tera McArthur and make at least a very rough assessment of her reliability.  They knew she had had a firsthand opportunity to observe her husband&#x92;s behavior, in particular with respect to the drugs at issue.  And they thought, with good reason, that her report to them reflected that opportunity.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Massachusetts
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/727" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 727</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">732</a>&#x96;734 (1984)
<em>
					(per curiam)
				</em>
				 (upholding search warrant issued in similar circumstances).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the police had good reason to fear that, unless restrained, McArthur would destroy the drugs before they could return with a warrant.  They reasonably might have thought that McArthur realized that his wife knew about his marijuana stash; observed that she was angry or frightened enough to ask the police to accompany her; saw that after leaving the trailer she had spoken with the police; and noticed that she had walked off with one policeman while leaving the other outside to observe the trailer.  They reasonably could have concluded that McArthur, consequently suspecting an imminent search, would, if given the chance, get rid of the drugs fast.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the police made reasonable efforts to reconcile their law enforcement needs with the demands of personal privacy.  They neither searched the trailer nor arrested McArthur before obtaining a warrant.  Rather, they imposed a significantly less restrictive restraint, preventing McArthur only from entering the trailer unaccompanied.  They left his home and his belongings intact&#x97;until a neutral Magistrate, finding probable cause, issued a warrant.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Fourth, the police imposed the restraint for a limited period of time, namely, two hours.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Terry
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Ohio,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 28 (manner in which police act is &#x93;vital &#x2026; part of &#x2026; inquiry&#x94;).  As far as the record reveals, this time period was no longer than reasonably necessary for the police, acting with diligence, to obtain the warrant.  Compare 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Place, supra,
				</em>
				 at 709&#x96;710 (holding 90-minute detention of luggage unreasonable based on nature of interference with person&#x92;s travels and lack of diligence of police), with

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">253</a> (1970)
 (holding 29-hour detention of mailed package reasonable given unavoidable delay in obtaining warrant and minimal nature of intrusion).  Given the nature of the intrusion and the law enforcement interest at stake, this brief seizure of the premises was permissible.

				Our conclusion that the restriction was lawful finds significant support in this Court&#x92;s case law.  In 
				<em>
					Segura
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/468/796" class="subref" title="subref">468 U. S. 796</a> (1984)
, the Court considered the admissibility of drugs which the police had found in a lawful, warrant-based search of an apartment, but only after unlawfully entering the apartment and occupying it for 19 hours.  The majority held that the drugs were admissible because, had the police acted lawfully throughout, they could have discovered and seized the drugs pursuant to the validly issued warrant.  See 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 799, 814&#x96;815 (citing

).  The minority disagreed.  However, when describing alternative lawful search and seizure methods, both majority and minority assumed, at least for argument&#x92;s sake, that the police, armed with reliable information that the apartment contained drugs, might lawfully have sealed the apartment from the outside, restricting entry into the apartment while waiting for the warrant.  Compare

				Nor are we persuaded by the countervailing considerations that the parties or lower courts have raised.  McArthur argues that the police proceeded without probable cause.  But McArthur has waived this argument.  See 304 Ill. App. 3d, at 397, 713 N. E. 2d, at 95 (stating that McArthur does not contest existence of probable cause); Brief in Opposition 7 (acknowledging probable cause).  And, in any event, it is without merit.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;5.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Appellate Court of Illinois concluded that the police could not order McArthur to stay outside his home because McArthur&#x92;s porch, where he stood at the time, was part of his home; hence the order &#x93;amounted to a constructive eviction&#x94; of McArthur from his residence.  304 Ill. App. 3d, at 402, 713 N. E. 2d, at 98.  This Court has held, however, that a person standing in the doorway of a house is &#x93;in a &#x91;public&#x92; place,&#x94; and hence subject to arrest without a warrant permitting entry of the home.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">42</a> (1976)
.  Regardless, we do not believe the difference to which the Appellate Court points&#x97;porch versus, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 front walk&#x97;could make a significant difference here as to the reasonableness of the police restraint; and that, from the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>&#x92;s perspective, is what matters.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Appellate Court also found negatively significant the fact that Chief Love, with McArthur&#x92;s consent, stepped inside the trailer&#x92;s doorway to observe McArthur when McArthur reentered the trailer on two or three occasions.  304 Ill. App. 3d, at 402&#x96;403, 713 N. E. 2d, at 98.  McArthur, however, reentered simply for his own convenience, to make phone calls and to obtain cigarettes.  Under these circumstances, the reasonableness of the greater restriction (preventing reentry) implies the reasonableness of the lesser (permitting reentry conditioned on observation).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, McArthur points to a case (and we believe it is the only case) that he believes offers direct support, namely, 
				<em>
					Welsh
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Wisconsin, supra.
				</em>
				  In 
				<em>
					Welsh
				</em>
				, this Court held that police could not enter a home without a warrant in order to prevent the loss of evidence (namely, the defendant&#x92;s blood alcohol level) of the &#x93;nonjailable traffic offense&#x94; of driving while intoxicated.  466 U. S., at 742, 754.  McArthur notes that his two convictions are for misdemeanors, which, he says, are as minor, and he adds that the restraint, keeping him out of his home, was nearly as serious.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We nonetheless find significant distinctions.  The evidence at issue here was of crimes that were &#x93;jailable,&#x94; not &#x93;nonjailable.&#x94;  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, &#xA7;550/4(a) (1998); ch. 730, &#xA7;5/5&#x96;8&#x96;3(3) (possession of less than 2.5 grams of marijuana punishable by up to 30 days in jail); ch. 720, &#xA7;600/3.5; ch. 730, &#xA7;5/5&#x96;8&#x96;3(1) (possession of drug paraphernalia punishable by up to one year in jail).  In 
				<em>
					Welsh
				</em>
				, we noted that, &#x93;[g]iven that the classification of state crimes differs widely among the States, the penalty that may attach to any particular offense seems to provide the clearest and most consistent indication of the State&#x92;s interest in arresting individuals suspected of committing that offense.&#x94;  466 U. S., at 754, n. 14.  The same reasoning applies here, where class C misdemeanors include such widely diverse offenses as drag racing, drinking alcohol in a railroad car or on a railroad platform, bribery by a candidate for public office, and assault.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 65, &#xA7;5/4&#x96;8&#x96;2 (1998); ch. 610, &#xA7;90/1; ch. 625, &#xA7;5/11&#x96;504; ch. 720, &#xA7;5/12&#x96;1.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				And the restriction at issue here is less serious.  Temporarily keeping a person from entering his home, a consequence whenever police stop a person on the street, is considerably less intrusive than police entry into the home itself in order to make a warrantless arrest or conduct a search.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Payton
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					New York,
				</em>
				 445 U. S., at 585 (the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>&#x92;s central concern is the warrantless entry and search of the home).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We have explained above why we believe that the need to preserve evidence of a &#x93;jailable&#x94; offense was sufficiently urgent or pressing to justify the restriction upon entry that the police imposed.  We need not decide whether the circumstances before us would have justified a greater restriction for this type of offense or the same restriction were only a &#x93;nonjailable&#x94; offense at issue.

        <p class="opcentered">

        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				In sum, the police officers in this case had probable cause to believe that a home contained contraband, which was evidence of a crime.  They reasonably believed that the home&#x92;s resident, if left free of any restraint, would destroy that evidence.  And they imposed a restraint that was both limited and tailored reasonably to secure law enforcement needs while protecting privacy interests.  In our view, the restraint met the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>&#x92;s demands.

				On April 2, 1997, Tera McArthur asked two police officers to accompany her to the trailer where she lived with her husband, Charles, so that they could keep the peace while she removed her belongings.  The two officers, Assistant Chief John Love and Officer Richard Skidis, arrived with Tera at the trailer at about 3:15 p.m.  Tera went inside, where Charles was present.  The officers remained outside.

				Love told Charles, who by this time was also on the porch, that he could not reenter the trailer unless a police officer accompanied him.

				Officer Skidis obtained the warrant by about 5 p.m.  He returned to the trailer and, along with other officers, searched it.

				Illinois subsequently charged Charles McArthur with unlawfully possessing drug paraphernalia and marijuana (less than 2.5 grams), both misdemeanors.  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, &#xA7;&#xA7;550/4(a), 600/3.5(a) (1998).  McArthur moved to suppress the pipe, box, and marijuana on the ground that they were the &#x93;fruit&#x94; of an unlawful police seizure, namely, the refusal to let him reenter the trailer unaccompanied, which would have permitted him, he said, to &#x93;have destroyed the marijuana.&#x94;  App. 27.

				The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> says that the &#x93;right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.&#x94;  U.

.  In order to enforce that requirement, this Court has interpreted the Amendment as establishing rules and presumptions designed to control conduct of law enforcement officers that may significantly intrude upon privacy interests.  Sometimes those rules require warrants.  We have said, for example, that in &#x93;the ordinary case,&#x94; seizures of personal property are &#x93;unreasonable within the meaning of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>,&#x94; without more, &#x93;unless . . . accomplished pursuant to a judicial warrant,&#x94; issued by a neutral magistrate after finding probable cause.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We conclude that the restriction at issue was reasonable, and hence lawful, in light of the following circumstances, which we consider in combination.  First, the police had probable cause to believe that McArthur&#x92;s trailer home contained evidence of a crime and contraband, namely, unlawful drugs.  The police had had an opportunity to speak with Tera McArthur and make at least a very rough assessment of her reliability.  They knew she had had a firsthand opportunity to observe her husband&#x92;s behavior, in particular with respect to the drugs at issue.  And they thought, with good reason, that her report to them reflected that opportunity.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Massachusetts
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/727" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 727</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">732</a>&#x96;734 (1984)
<em>
					(per curiam)
				</em>
				 (upholding search warrant issued in similar circumstances).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the police had good reason to fear that, unless restrained, McArthur would destroy the drugs before they could return with a warrant.  They reasonably might have thought that McArthur realized that his wife knew about his marijuana stash; observed that she was angry or frightened enough to ask the police to accompany her; saw that after leaving the trailer she had spoken with the police; and noticed that she had walked off with one policeman while leaving the other outside to observe the trailer.  They reasonably could have concluded that McArthur, consequently suspecting an imminent search, would, if given the chance, get rid of the drugs fast.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the police made reasonable efforts to reconcile their law enforcement needs with the demands of personal privacy.  They neither searched the trailer nor arrested McArthur before obtaining a warrant.  Rather, they imposed a significantly less restrictive restraint, preventing McArthur only from entering the trailer unaccompanied.  They left his home and his belongings intact&#x97;until a neutral Magistrate, finding probable cause, issued a warrant.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Fourth, the police imposed the restraint for a limited period of time, namely, two hours.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Terry
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Ohio,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 28 (manner in which police act is &#x93;vital &#x2026; part of &#x2026; inquiry&#x94;).  As far as the record reveals, this time period was no longer than reasonably necessary for the police, acting with diligence, to obtain the warrant.  Compare 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Place, supra,
				</em>
				 at 709&#x96;710 (holding 90-minute detention of luggage unreasonable based on nature of interference with person&#x92;s travels and lack of diligence of police), with

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">253</a> (1970)
 (holding 29-hour detention of mailed package reasonable given unavoidable delay in obtaining warrant and minimal nature of intrusion).  Given the nature of the intrusion and the law enforcement interest at stake, this brief seizure of the premises was permissible.

				Our conclusion that the restriction was lawful finds significant support in this Court&#x92;s case law.  In 
				<em>
					Segura
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/468/796" class="subref" title="subref">468 U. S. 796</a> (1984)
, the Court considered the admissibility of drugs which the police had found in a lawful, warrant-based search of an apartment, but only after unlawfully entering the apartment and occupying it for 19 hours.  The majority held that the drugs were admissible because, had the police acted lawfully throughout, they could have discovered and seized the drugs pursuant to the validly issued warrant.  See 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 799, 814&#x96;815 (citing 
				<em>

).  The minority disagreed.  However, when describing alternative lawful search and seizure methods, both majority and minority assumed, at least for argument&#x92;s sake, that the police, armed with reliable information that the apartment contained drugs, might lawfully have sealed the apartment from the outside, restricting entry into the apartment while waiting for the warrant.  Compare 
				<em>
					Segura
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>

				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 814 (&#x93;Had police never entered the apartment, but instead conducted a perimeter stakeout to prevent anyone from entering &#x2026; and destroying evidence, the contraband &#x2026; would have been &#x2026; seized precisely as it was here&#x94;), with

				We have found no case in which this Court has held unlawful a temporary seizure that was supported by probable cause and was designed to prevent the loss of evidence while the police diligently obtained a warrant in a reasonable period of time.  But cf.

				Nor are we persuaded by the countervailing considerations that the parties or lower courts have raised.  McArthur argues that the police proceeded without probable cause.  But McArthur has waived this argument.  See 304 Ill. App. 3d, at 397, 713 N. E. 2d, at 95 (stating that McArthur does not contest existence of probable cause); Brief in Opposition 7 (acknowledging probable cause).  And, in any event, it is without merit.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;5.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Appellate Court of Illinois concluded that the police could not order McArthur to stay outside his home because McArthur&#x92;s porch, where he stood at the time, was part of his home; hence the order &#x93;amounted to a constructive eviction&#x94; of McArthur from his residence.  304 Ill. App. 3d, at 402, 713 N. E. 2d, at 98.  This Court has held, however, that a person standing in the doorway of a house is &#x93;in a &#x91;public&#x92; place,&#x94; and hence subject to arrest without a warrant permitting entry of the home.  
				<em>
					United States

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">42</a> (1976)
.  Regardless, we do not believe the difference to which the Appellate Court points&#x97;porch versus, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 front walk&#x97;could make a significant difference here as to the reasonableness of the police restraint; and that, from the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>&#x92;s perspective, is what matters.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Appellate Court also found negatively significant the fact that Chief Love, with McArthur&#x92;s consent, stepped inside the trailer&#x92;s doorway to observe McArthur when McArthur reentered the trailer on two or three occasions.  304 Ill. App. 3d, at 402&#x96;403, 713 N. E. 2d, at 98.  McArthur, however, reentered simply for his own convenience, to make phone calls and to obtain cigarettes.  Under these circumstances, the reasonableness of the greater restriction (preventing reentry) implies the reasonableness of the lesser (permitting reentry conditioned on observation).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, McArthur points to a case (and we believe it is the only case) that he believes offers direct support, namely, 
				<em>
					Welsh
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Wisconsin, supra.
				</em>
				  In 
				<em>
					Welsh
				</em>
				, this Court held that police could not enter a home without a warrant in order to prevent the loss of evidence (namely, the defendant&#x92;s blood alcohol level) of the &#x93;nonjailable traffic offense&#x94; of driving while intoxicated.  466 U. S., at 742, 754.  McArthur notes that his two convictions are for misdemeanors, which, he says, are as minor, and he adds that the restraint, keeping him out of his home, was nearly as serious.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We nonetheless find significant distinctions.  The evidence at issue here was of crimes that were &#x93;jailable,&#x94; not &#x93;nonjailable.&#x94;  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, &#xA7;550/4(a) (1998); ch. 730, &#xA7;5/5&#x96;8&#x96;3(3) (possession of less than 2.5 grams of marijuana punishable by up to 30 days in jail); ch. 720, &#xA7;600/3.5; ch. 730, &#xA7;5/5&#x96;8&#x96;3(1) (possession of drug paraphernalia punishable by up to one year in jail).  In 
				<em>
					Welsh
				</em>
				, we noted that, &#x93;[g]iven that the classification of state crimes differs widely among the States, the penalty that may attach to any particular offense seems to provide the clearest and most consistent indication of the State&#x92;s interest in arresting individuals suspected of committing that offense.&#x94;  466 U. S., at 754, n. 14.  The same reasoning applies here, where class C misdemeanors include such widely diverse offenses as drag racing, drinking alcohol in a railroad car or on a railroad platform, bribery by a candidate for public office, and assault.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 65, &#xA7;5/4&#x96;8&#x96;2 (1998); ch. 610, &#xA7;90/1; ch. 625, &#xA7;5/11&#x96;504; ch. 720, &#xA7;5/12&#x96;1.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				And the restriction at issue here is less serious.  Temporarily keeping a person from entering his home, a consequence whenever police stop a person on the street, is considerably less intrusive than police entry into the home itself in order to make a warrantless arrest or conduct a search.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Payton
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					New York,
				</em>
				 445 U. S., at 585 (the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>&#x92;s central concern is the warrantless entry and search of the home).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We have explained above why we believe that the need to preserve evidence of a &#x93;jailable&#x94; offense was sufficiently urgent or pressing to justify the restriction upon entry that the police imposed.  We need not decide whether the circumstances before us would have justified a greater restriction for this type of offense or the same restriction were only a &#x93;nonjailable&#x94; offense at issue.
			</p>
        <p class="opcentered">
				III
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				In sum, the police officers in this case had probable cause to believe that a home contained contraband, which was evidence of a crime.  They reasonably believed that the home&#x92;s resident, if left free of any restraint, would destroy that evidence.  And they imposed a restraint that was both limited and tailored reasonably to secure law enforcement needs while protecting privacy interests.  In our view, the restraint met the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>&#x92;s demands.

				On April 2, 1997, Tera McArthur asked two police officers to accompany her to the trailer where she lived with her husband, Charles, so that they could keep the peace while she removed her belongings.  The two officers, Assistant Chief John Love and Officer Richard Skidis, arrived with Tera at the trailer at about 3:15 p.m.  Tera went inside, where Charles was present.  The officers remained outside.

				Love told Charles, who by this time was also on the porch, that he could not reenter the trailer unless a police officer accompanied him.

				Officer Skidis obtained the warrant by about 5 p.m.  He returned to the trailer and, along with other officers, searched it.

Stat., ch. 720, &#xA7;&#xA7;550/4(a), 600/3.5(a) (1998).  McArthur moved to suppress the pipe, box, and marijuana on the ground that they were the &#x93;fruit&#x94; of an unlawful police seizure, namely, the refusal to let him reenter the trailer unaccompanied, which would have permitted him, he said, to &#x93;have destroyed the marijuana.&#x94;  App. 27.

				The 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> says that the &#x93;right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.&#x94;  U. S. Const., Amdt. 4.  Its &#x93;central requirement&#x94; is one of reasonableness.  See

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">739</a> (1983)
.  In order to enforce that requirement, this Court has interpreted the Amendment as establishing rules and presumptions designed to control conduct of law enforcement officers that may significantly intrude upon privacy interests.  Sometimes those rules require warrants.  We have said, for example, that in &#x93;the ordinary case,&#x94; seizures of personal property are &#x93;unreasonable within the meaning of the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>,&#x94; without more, &#x93;unless . . . accomplished pursuant to a judicial warrant,&#x94; issued by a neutral magistrate after finding probable cause.

				We nonetheless have made it clear that there are exceptions to the warrant requirement.

				In the circumstances of the case before us, we cannot say that the warrantless seizure was

				</em>
            <em>

 (&#x93; &#x91;[T]he chief evil against which the &#x2026; 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a> is directed&#x92; &#x94; is warrantless entry and search of home) (quoting

 (same).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We conclude that the restriction at issue was reasonable, and hence lawful, in light of the following circumstances, which we consider in combination.  First, the police had probable cause to believe that McArthur&#x92;s trailer home contained evidence of a crime and contraband, namely, unlawful drugs.  The police had had an opportunity to speak with Tera McArthur and make at least a very rough assessment of her reliability.  They knew she had had a firsthand opportunity to observe her husband&#x92;s behavior, in particular with respect to the drugs at issue.  And they thought, with good reason, that her report to them reflected that opportunity.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Massachusetts
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Upton,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/466/727" class="subref" title="subref">466 U. S. 727</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">732</a>&#x96;734 (1984)
<em>
					(per curiam)
				</em>
				 (upholding search warrant issued in similar circumstances).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Second, the police had good reason to fear that, unless restrained, McArthur would destroy the drugs before they could return with a warrant.  They reasonably might have thought that McArthur realized that his wife knew about his marijuana stash; observed that she was angry or frightened enough to ask the police to accompany her; saw that after leaving the trailer she had spoken with the police; and noticed that she had walked off with one policeman while leaving the other outside to observe the trailer.  They reasonably could have concluded that McArthur, consequently suspecting an imminent search, would, if given the chance, get rid of the drugs fast.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Third, the police made reasonable efforts to reconcile their law enforcement needs with the demands of personal privacy.  They neither searched the trailer nor arrested McArthur before obtaining a warrant.  Rather, they imposed a significantly less restrictive restraint, preventing McArthur only from entering the trailer unaccompanied.  They left his home and his belongings intact&#x97;until a neutral Magistrate, finding probable cause, issued a warrant.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Fourth, the police imposed the restraint for a limited period of time, namely, two hours.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Terry
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Ohio,
				</em>
            <em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 28 (manner in which police act is &#x93;vital &#x2026; part of &#x2026; inquiry&#x94;).  As far as the record reveals, this time period was no longer than reasonably necessary for the police, acting with diligence, to obtain the warrant.  Compare 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Place, supra,
				</em>
				 at 709&#x96;710 (holding 90-minute detention of luggage unreasonable based on nature of interference with person&#x92;s travels and lack of diligence of police), with 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v.

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">253</a> (1970)
 (holding 29-hour detention of mailed package reasonable given unavoidable delay in obtaining warrant and minimal nature of intrusion).  Given the nature of the intrusion and the law enforcement interest at stake, this brief seizure of the premises was permissible.

				Our conclusion that the restriction was lawful finds significant support in this Court&#x92;s case law.  In 
				<em>
					Segura
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/468/796" class="subref" title="subref">468 U. S. 796</a> (1984)
, the Court considered the admissibility of drugs which the police had found in a lawful, warrant-based search of an apartment, but only after unlawfully entering the apartment and occupying it for 19 hours.  The majority held that the drugs were admissible because, had the police acted lawfully throughout, they could have discovered and seized the drugs pursuant to the validly issued warrant.  See 
				<em>
					id., 
				</em>
				at 799, 814&#x96;815 (citing 
				<em>
					Silverthorne Lumber Co.
				</em>
				 v.

).  The minority disagreed.  However, when describing alternative lawful search and seizure methods, both majority and minority assumed, at least for argument&#x92;s sake, that the police, armed with reliable information that the apartment contained drugs, might lawfully have sealed the apartment from the outside, restricting entry into the apartment while waiting for the warrant.  Compare 
				<em>
					Segura
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				, 468 U. S., at 814 (&#x93;Had police never entered the apartment, but instead conducted a perimeter stakeout to prevent anyone from entering &#x2026; and destroying evidence, the contraband &#x2026; would have been &#x2026; seized precisely as it was here&#x94;), with

				We have found no case in which this Court has held unlawful a temporary seizure that was supported by probable cause and was designed to prevent the loss of evidence while the police diligently obtained a warrant in a reasonable period of time.  But cf.

				Nor are we persuaded by the countervailing considerations that the parties or lower courts have raised.  McArthur argues that the police proceeded without probable cause.  But McArthur has waived this argument.  See 304 Ill. App. 3d, at 397, 713 N. E. 2d, at 95 (stating that McArthur does not contest existence of probable cause); Brief in Opposition 7 (acknowledging probable cause).  And, in any event, it is without merit.  See 
				<em>
					supra
				</em>
				, at 4&#x96;5.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				
				    
				The Appellate Court of Illinois concluded that the police could not order McArthur to stay outside his home because McArthur&#x92;s porch, where he stood at the time, was part of his home; hence the order &#x93;amounted to a constructive eviction&#x94; of McArthur from his residence.  304 Ill. App. 3d, at 402, 713 N. E. 2d, at 98.  This Court has held, however, that a person standing in the doorway of a house is &#x93;in a &#x91;public&#x92; place,&#x94; and hence subject to arrest without a warrant permitting entry of the home.  
				<em>
					United States
				</em>
				 v.

				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/427/38" class="subref" title="subref">427 U. S. 38</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">42</a> (1976)
.  Regardless, we do not believe the difference to which the Appellate Court points&#x97;porch versus, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 front walk&#x97;could make a significant difference here as to the reasonableness of the police restraint; and that, from the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>&#x92;s perspective, is what matters.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				The Appellate Court also found negatively significant the fact that Chief Love, with McArthur&#x92;s consent, stepped inside the trailer&#x92;s doorway to observe McArthur when McArthur reentered the trailer on two or three occasions.  304 Ill. App. 3d, at 402&#x96;403, 713 N. E. 2d, at 98.  McArthur, however, reentered simply for his own convenience, to make phone calls and to obtain cigarettes.  Under these circumstances, the reasonableness of the greater restriction (preventing reentry) implies the reasonableness of the lesser (permitting reentry conditioned on observation).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, McArthur points to a case (and we believe it is the only case) that he believes offers direct support, namely, 
				<em>
					Welsh
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Wisconsin, supra.
				</em>
				  In 
				<em>
					Welsh
				</em>
				, this Court held that police could not enter a home without a warrant in order to prevent the loss of evidence (namely, the defendant&#x92;s blood alcohol level) of the &#x93;nonjailable traffic offense&#x94; of driving while intoxicated.  466 U. S., at 742, 754.  McArthur notes that his two convictions are for misdemeanors, which, he says, are as minor, and he adds that the restraint, keeping him out of his home, was nearly as serious.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We nonetheless find significant distinctions.  The evidence at issue here was of crimes that were &#x93;jailable,&#x94; not &#x93;nonjailable.&#x94;  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, &#xA7;550/4(a) (1998); ch. 730, &#xA7;5/5&#x96;8&#x96;3(3) (possession of less than 2.5 grams of marijuana punishable by up to 30 days in jail); ch. 720, &#xA7;600/3.5; ch. 730, &#xA7;5/5&#x96;8&#x96;3(1) (possession of drug paraphernalia punishable by up to one year in jail).  In 
				<em>
					Welsh
				</em>
				, we noted that, &#x93;[g]iven that the classification of state crimes differs widely among the States, the penalty that may attach to any particular offense seems to provide the clearest and most consistent indication of the State&#x92;s interest in arresting individuals suspected of committing that offense.&#x94;  466 U. S., at 754, n. 14.  The same reasoning applies here, where class C misdemeanors include such widely diverse offenses as drag racing, drinking alcohol in a railroad car or on a railroad platform, bribery by a candidate for public office, and assault.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.
				</em>
				, Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 65, &#xA7;5/4&#x96;8&#x96;2 (1998); ch. 610, &#xA7;90/1; ch. 625, &#xA7;5/11&#x96;504; ch. 720, &#xA7;5/12&#x96;1.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				And the restriction at issue here is less serious.  Temporarily keeping a person from entering his home, a consequence whenever police stop a person on the street, is considerably less intrusive than police entry into the home itself in order to make a warrantless arrest or conduct a search.  Cf. 
				<em>
					Payton
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					New York,
				</em>
				 445 U. S., at 585 (the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>&#x92;s central concern is the warrantless entry and search of the home).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				We have explained above why we believe that the need to preserve evidence of a &#x93;jailable&#x94; offense was sufficiently urgent or pressing to justify the restriction upon entry that the police imposed.  We need not decide whether the circumstances before us would have justified a greater restriction for this type of offense or the same restriction were only a &#x93;nonjailable&#x94; offense at issue.

        <p class="opcentered">

			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				In sum, the police officers in this case had probable cause to believe that a home contained contraband, which was evidence of a crime.  They reasonably believed that the home&#x92;s resident, if left free of any restraint, would destroy that evidence.  And they imposed a restraint that was both limited and tailored reasonably to secure law enforcement needs while protecting privacy interests.  In our view, the restraint met the 
 <a href="/supct-cgi/get-const?amendmentiv" class="subref" title="subref">Fourth Amendment</a>&#x92;s demands.

				I join the Court&#x92;s opinion subject to this afterword on two points: the constitutionality of a greater intrusion than the one here and the permissibility of choosing impoundment over immediate search.  Respondent McArthur&#x92;s location made the difference between the exigency that justified temporarily barring him from his own dwelling and circumstances that would have supported a greater interference with his privacy and property.  As long as he was inside his trailer, the police had probable cause to believe that he had illegal drugs stashed as his wife had reported and that with any sense he would flush them down the drain before the police could get a warrant to enter and search.  This probability of destruction in anticipation of a warrant exemplifies the kind of present risk that undergirds the accepted exigent circumstances exception to the general warrant requirement.

				Since, however, McArthur wished to go back in, why was it reasonable to keep him out when the police could perfectly well have let him do as he chose, and then enjoyed the ensuing opportunity to follow him and make a warrantless search justified by the renewed danger of destruction?  The answer is not that the law officiously insists on safeguarding a suspect&#x92;s privacy from search, in preference to respecting the suspect&#x92;s liberty to enter his own dwelling.  Instead, the legitimacy of the decision to impound the dwelling follows from the law&#x92;s strong preference for warrants, which underlies the rule that a search with a warrant has a stronger claim to justification on later, judicial review than a search without one.

				I join the Court&#x92;s opinion subject to this afterword on two points: the constitutionality of a greater intrusion than the one here and the permissibility of choosing impoundment over immediate search.  Respondent McArthur&#x92;s location made the difference between the exigency that justified temporarily barring him from his own dwelling and circumstances that would have supported a greater interference with his privacy and property.  As long as he was inside his trailer, the police had probable cause to believe that he had illegal drugs stashed as his wife had reported and that with any sense he would flush them down the drain before the police could get a warrant to enter and search.  This probability of destruction in anticipation of a warrant exemplifies the kind of present risk that undergirds the accepted exigent circumstances exception to the general warrant requirement.

				Since, however, McArthur wished to go back in, why was it reasonable to keep him out when the police could perfectly well have let him do as he chose, and then enjoyed the ensuing opportunity to follow him and make a warrantless search justified by the renewed danger of destruction?  The answer is not that the law officiously insists on safeguarding a suspect&#x92;s privacy from search, in preference to respecting the suspect&#x92;s liberty to enter his own dwelling.  Instead, the legitimacy of the decision to impound the dwelling follows from the law&#x92;s strong preference for warrants, which underlies the rule that a search with a warrant has a stronger claim to justification on later, judicial review than a search without one.

				I join the Court&#x92;s opinion subject to this afterword on two points: the constitutionality of a greater intrusion than the one here and the permissibility of choosing impoundment over immediate search.  Respondent McArthur&#x92;s location made the difference between the exigency that justified temporarily barring him from his own dwelling and circumstances that would have supported a greater interference with his privacy and property.  As long as he was inside his trailer, the police had probable cause to believe that he had illegal drugs stashed as his wife had reported and that with any sense he would flush them down the drain before the police could get a warrant to enter and search.  This probability of destruction in anticipation of a warrant exemplifies the kind of present risk that undergirds the accepted exigent circumstances exception to the general warrant requirement.

				Since, however, McArthur wished to go back in, why was it reasonable to keep him out when the police could perfectly well have let him do as he chose, and then enjoyed the ensuing opportunity to follow him and make a warrantless search justified by the renewed danger of destruction?  The answer is not that the law officiously insists on safeguarding a suspect&#x92;s privacy from search, in preference to respecting the suspect&#x92;s liberty to enter his own dwelling.  Instead, the legitimacy of the decision to impound the dwelling follows from the law&#x92;s strong preference for warrants, which underlies the rule that a search with a warrant has a stronger claim to justification on later, judicial review than a search without one.

The law can hardly raise incentives to obtain a warrant without giving the police a fair chance to take their probable cause to a magistrate and get one.

				The Illinois General Assembly has decided that the possession of less than 2.5 grams of marijuana is a class C misdemeanor.  See Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, &#xA7;550/4(a) (1998).
