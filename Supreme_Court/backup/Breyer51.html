				No. 02&#x96;695. Argued April 29, 2003&#x97;Decided June 9, 2003
			</div>
        <hr/>
        <p class="bodytext">
				An Iowa law that, among other things, authorized racetracks to operate slot machines and imposed a graduated tax upon racetrack slot machine adjusted revenues, with a top rate that started at 20 percent and would automatically rise over time to 36 percent, left a 20 percent tax rate on riverboat slot machine adjusted revenues in place.  Respondents, racetracks and a dog owners&#x92; association, filed a state-court suit challenging the law on the ground that the 20 percent/36 percent tax rate difference violated the Equal Protection Clause, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, &#xA7;1.  The District Court upheld the statute, but the Iowa Supreme Court reversed.
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTE">
				Held:
			</p>
        <p class="SYLCTF">
				
				    
				1. This Court has jurisdiction to review the state court&#x92;s judgment, which does not rest independently upon state law.  The state court&#x92;s opinion says that Iowa courts should apply the same analysis in considering either state or federal equal protection claims.  In such circumstances, this Court considers a state-court decision as resting upon federal grounds sufficient to support jurisdiction.  Pp. 2&#x96;3.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				2. Iowa&#x92;s differential tax rate does not violate the Federal Equal Protection Clause.  A law, such as Iowa&#x92;s, that distinguishes for tax purposes among revenues obtained within a State by two enterprises conducting business in the State, is subject to rational-basis review.  See 
				<em>
					Nordlinger
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Hahn,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/505/1" class="subref" title="subref">505 U. S. 1</a>.  The Iowa law, like most laws, might predominately serve one general objective, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
				 rescuing racetracks from economic distress, while containing subsidiary provisions that seek to achieve other desirable (perhaps even contrary) ends as well, thereby producing a law that balances objectives but still serves the general objective when seen as a whole.  And this law, 
				<em>
					seen as a whole

				, does what the state court says it seeks to do, namely, advance the racetracks&#x92; economic interests.  A rational legislator might believe that the law&#x92;s grant to the racetracks of authority to operate slot machines should help the racetracks economically&#x97;even if its simultaneous imposition of a tax on revenue means less help than respondents might like&#x97;and the Constitution grants legislators, not courts, broad authority (within the bounds of rationality) to decide whom they wish to help with their tax laws and how much help those laws should provide.  Once one realizes that not every provision in a single law must share a single objective, one has no difficulty finding the necessary rational support for the difference in tax rates here.  Though harmful to the racetracks, it is helpful to the riverboats, which were also facing financial peril.  This is not a case where the facts preclude any plausible inference that the reason for the different tax rates is to help the riverboat industry.  Cf.

				Iowa taxes adjusted revenues from slot machines on excursion riverboats at a maximum rate of 20 percent.  Iowa Code &#xA7;99F.11 (2003).  Iowa law provides for a maximum tax rate of 36 percent on adjusted revenues from slot machines at racetracks.  &#xA7;&#xA7;99F.4A(6), 99F.11.

				Before 1989, Iowa permitted only one form of gambling&#x97;parimutuel betting at racetracks&#x97;the proceeds of which it taxed at a six percent rate.  Iowa Code &#xA7;99D.15 (1984).  In 1989, it authorized other forms of gambling, including slot machines and other gambling games on riverboats, though it limited bets to $5 and losses to $200 per excursion.  1989 Iowa Acts ch. 67, &#xA7;&#xA7;3, 9(2); Iowa Code &#xA7;99F.3 (1996).

				The Iowa Supreme Court could not deny, however, that the Iowa law, like most laws, might predominately serve one general objective, say, helping the racetracks, while containing subsidiary provisions that seek to achieve other desirable (perhaps even contrary) ends as well, thereby producing a law that balances objectives but still serves the general objective when seen as a whole.

				Once one realizes that not every provision in a law must share a single objective, one has no difficulty finding the necessary rational support for the 20 percent/36 percent differential here at issue.  That difference, harmful to the racetracks, is helpful to the riverboats, which, as respondents concede, were also facing financial peril, Brief for Respondents 8.  See also 648 N. W. 2d, at 557.  These two characterizations are but opposite sides of the same coin.  Each reflects a rational way for a legislator to view the matter.  And aside from simply aiding the financial position of the riverboats, the legislators may have wanted to encourage the economic development of river communities or to promote riverboat history, say, by providing incentives for riverboats to remain in the State, rather than relocate to other States.  See Gaming Study Committee Report (Sept. 3, 1993), reprinted in App. 76&#x96;84, 86.  Alternatively, they may have wanted to protect the reliance interests of riverboat operators, whose adjusted slot machine revenue had previously been taxed at the 20 percent rate.  All these objectives are rational ones, which lower riverboat tax rates could further and which suffice to uphold the different tax rates.  See

				The Iowa Supreme Court could not deny, however, that the Iowa law, like most laws, might predominately serve one general objective, say, helping the racetracks, while containing subsidiary provisions that seek to achieve other desirable (perhaps even contrary) ends as well, thereby producing a law that balances objectives but still serves the general objective when seen as a whole.

Its grant to the racetracks of authority to operate slot machines should help the racetracks economically to some degree&#x97;even if its simultaneous imposition of a tax on slot machine adjusted revenue means that the law provides less help than respondents might like.  At least a rational legislator might so believe.  And the Constitution grants legislators, not courts, broad authority (within the bounds of rationality) to decide whom they wish to help with their tax laws and how much help those laws ought to provide.  &#x93;The &#x91;task of classifying persons for &#x2026; benefits &#x2026; inevitably requires that some persons who have an almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be placed on different sides of the line,&#x92; and the fact the line might have been drawn differently at some points is a matter for legislative, rather than judicial, consideration.&#x94;

				Once one realizes that not every provision in a law must share a single objective, one has no difficulty finding the necessary rational support for the 20 percent/36 percent differential here at issue.  That difference, harmful to the racetracks, is helpful to the riverboats, which, as respondents concede, were also facing financial peril, Brief for Respondents 8.  See also 648 N. W. 2d, at 557.  These two characterizations are but opposite sides of the same coin.  Each reflects a rational way for a legislator to view the matter.  And aside from simply aiding the financial position of the riverboats, the legislators may have wanted to encourage the economic development of river communities or to promote riverboat history, say, by providing incentives for riverboats to remain in the State, rather than relocate to other States.  See Gaming Study Committee Report (Sept. 3, 1993), reprinted in App. 76&#x96;84, 86.  Alternatively, they may have wanted to protect the reliance interests of riverboat operators, whose adjusted slot machine revenue had previously been taxed at the 20 percent rate.  All these objectives are rational ones, which lower riverboat tax rates could further and which suffice to uphold the different tax rates.  See

				Iowa taxes adjusted revenues from slot machines on excursion riverboats at a maximum rate of 20 percent.  Iowa Code &#xA7;99F.11 (2003).

				Before 1989, Iowa permitted only one form of gambling&#x97;parimutuel betting at racetracks&#x97;the proceeds of which it taxed at a six percent rate.  Iowa Code &#xA7;99D.15 (1984).  In 1989, it authorized other forms of gambling, including slot machines and other gambling games on riverboats, though it limited bets to $5 and losses to $200 per excursion.  1989 Iowa Acts ch. 67, &#xA7;&#xA7;3, 9(2); Iowa Code &#xA7;99F.3 (1996).  Iowa taxed adjusted revenues from slot machine gambling at graduated rates, with a top rate of 20 percent.  1989 Iowa Acts ch. 67, &#xA7;11; Iowa Code &#xA7;99F.11 (1996).

				Respondents, a group of racetracks and an association of dog owners, brought this lawsuit in state court challenging the 1994 legislation on the ground that the 20 percent/36 percent tax rate difference that it created violated the Federal Constitution&#x92;s Equal Protection Clause, Amdt. 14, &#xA7;1.

We disagree.  The Iowa Supreme Court&#x92;s opinion, after setting forth the language of both State and Federal Equal Protection Clauses, says that &#x93;Iowa courts are to &#x91;apply the same analysis in considering the state equal protection claims as &#x2026; in considering the federal equal protection claim.&#x92; &#x94;

				The Iowa Supreme Court found that the 20 percent/36 percent tax rate differential failed to meet this standard because, in its view, that difference &#x93;frustrated&#x94; what it saw as the law&#x92;s basic objective, namely, rescuing the racetracks from economic distress.  648 N.

				The Iowa Supreme Court could not deny, however, that the Iowa law, like most laws, might predominately serve one general objective, say, helping the racetracks, while containing subsidiary provisions that seek to achieve other desirable (perhaps even contrary) ends as well, thereby producing a law that balances objectives but still serves the general objective when seen as a whole.

Its grant to the racetracks of authority to operate slot machines should help the racetracks economically to some degree&#x97;even if its simultaneous imposition of a tax on slot machine adjusted revenue means that the law provides less help than respondents might like.  At least a rational legislator might so believe.  And the Constitution grants legislators, not courts, broad authority (within the bounds of rationality) to decide whom they wish to help with their tax laws and how much help those laws ought to provide.  &#x93;The &#x91;task of classifying persons for &#x2026; benefits &#x2026; inevitably requires that some persons who have an almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be placed on different sides of the line,&#x92; and the fact the line might have been drawn differently at some points is a matter for legislative, rather than judicial, consideration.&#x94;

				Once one realizes that not every provision in a law must share a single objective, one has no difficulty finding the necessary rational support for the 20 percent/36 percent differential here at issue.  That difference, harmful to the racetracks, is helpful to the riverboats, which, as respondents concede, were also facing financial peril, Brief for Respondents 8.  See also 648 N. W. 2d, at 557.  These two characterizations are but opposite sides of the same coin.  Each reflects a rational way for a legislator to view the matter.  And aside from simply aiding the financial position of the riverboats, the legislators may have wanted to encourage the economic development of river communities or to promote riverboat history, say, by providing incentives for riverboats to remain in the State, rather than relocate to other States.  See Gaming Study Committee Report (Sept. 3, 1993), reprinted in App. 76&#x96;84, 86.  Alternatively, they may have wanted to protect the reliance interests of riverboat operators, whose adjusted slot machine revenue had previously been taxed at the 20 percent rate.  All these objectives are rational ones, which lower riverboat tax rates could further and which suffice to uphold the different tax rates.  See

The Iowa Supreme Court&#x92;s opinion, after setting forth the language of both State and Federal Equal Protection Clauses, says that &#x93;Iowa courts are to &#x91;apply the same analysis in considering the state equal protection claims as &#x2026; in considering the federal equal protection claim.&#x92; &#x94;

				The Iowa Supreme Court found that the 20 percent/36 percent tax rate differential failed to meet this standard because, in its view, that difference &#x93;frustrated&#x94; what it saw as the law&#x92;s basic objective, namely, rescuing the racetracks from economic distress.  648 N.

				The Iowa Supreme Court could not deny, however, that the Iowa law, like most laws, might predominately serve one general objective, say, helping the racetracks, while containing subsidiary provisions that seek to achieve other desirable (perhaps even contrary) ends as well, thereby producing a law that balances objectives but still serves the general objective when seen as a whole.

				<em>

				 subsidiary provision in a law designed to help racetracks had to help those racetracks and nothing more, then (since any tax rate hurts the racetracks when compared with a lower rate) there could be no taxation of the racetracks at all.

				Neither could the Iowa Supreme Court deny that the 1994 legislation, 
				<em>
					seen as a whole
				</em>
				, can rationally be understood to do what that court says it seeks to do, namely, advance the racetracks&#x92; economic interests.  Its grant to the racetracks of authority to operate slot machines should help the racetracks economically to some degree&#x97;even if its simultaneous imposition of a tax on slot machine adjusted revenue means that the law provides less help than respondents might like.  At least a rational legislator might so believe.  And the Constitution grants legislators, not courts, broad authority (within the bounds of rationality) to decide whom they wish to help with their tax laws and how much help those laws ought to provide.  &#x93;The &#x91;task of classifying persons for &#x2026; benefits &#x2026; inevitably requires that some persons who have an almost equally strong claim to favored treatment be placed on different sides of the line,&#x92; and the fact the line might have been drawn differently at some points is a matter for legislative, rather than judicial, consideration.&#x94;

				Once one realizes that not every provision in a law must share a single objective, one has no difficulty finding the necessary rational support for the 20 percent/36 percent differential here at issue.  That difference, harmful to the racetracks, is helpful to the riverboats, which, as respondents concede, were also facing financial peril, Brief for Respondents 8.  See also 648 N. W. 2d, at 557.  These two characterizations are but opposite sides of the same coin.  Each reflects a rational way for a legislator to view the matter.  And aside from simply aiding the financial position of the riverboats, the legislators may have wanted to encourage the economic development of river communities or to promote riverboat history, say, by providing incentives for riverboats to remain in the State, rather than relocate to other States.  See Gaming Study Committee Report (Sept. 3, 1993), reprinted in App. 76&#x96;84, 86.  Alternatively, they may have wanted to protect the reliance interests of riverboat operators, whose adjusted slot machine revenue had previously been taxed at the 20 percent rate.  All these objectives are rational ones, which lower riverboat tax rates could further and which suffice to uphold the different tax rates.  See
