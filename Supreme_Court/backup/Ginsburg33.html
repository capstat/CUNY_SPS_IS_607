        <p class="bodytext">
				

				    
				Under a rule adopted by the Commissioner of Social Security, in determining whether a claimant is entitled to Social Security disability benefits, special weight is accorded opinions of the claimant&#x92;s treating physician.  See 20 CFR &#xA7;&#xA7;404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2) (2002).
				  
				This case presents the question whether a similar &#x93;treating physician rule&#x94; applies to disability determinations under employee benefits plans covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA or Act), 
<a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">88</a>Stat.
832, as amended, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/1001.html" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. &#xA7;1001</a>
            <em>
					et seq
				</em>
				.  We hold that plan administrators are not obliged to accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				ERISA and the Secretary of Labor&#x92;s regulations under the Act require &#x93;full and fair&#x94; assessment of claims and clear communication to the claimant of the &#x93;specific reasons&#x94; for benefit denials.  See 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/1133.html" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. &#xA7;1133</a>; 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/2560" class="subref" title="subref">29 CFR &#xA7;2560.503</a>&#x96;1 (2002).  But these measures do not command plan administrators to credit the opinions of treating physicians over other evidence relevant to the claimant&#x92;s medical condition.  Because the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit erroneously applied a &#x93;treating physician rule&#x94; to a disability plan governed by ERISA, we vacate that court&#x92;s judgment and remand for further proceedings.

				Petitioner Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan (Plan), an ERISA-governed employee welfare benefit plan, covers employees of Black and Decker Corporation (Black &amp; Decker) and certain of its subsidiaries.  The Plan provides benefits for eligible employees with a &#x93;disability.&#x94;  As relevant here, the Plan defines &#x93;disability&#x94; to mean &#x93;the complete inability &#x2026; of a Participant to engage in his regular occupation with the Employer.&#x94;

Black &amp; Decker both funds the Plan and acts as plan administrator, but it has delegated authority to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) to render initial recommendations on benefit claims.  Disability determinations, the Black &amp; Decker Plan provides, &#x93;[are to] be made by the [plan administrator] based on suitable medical evidence and a review of the Participant&#x92;s employment history that the [plan administrator] deems satisfactory in its sole and absolute discretion.&#x94;

				In 1997, Nord consulted Dr. Leo Hartman about hip and back pain.  Dr. Hartman determined that Nord suffers from a mild degenerative disc disease, a diagnosis confirmed by a Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan.  After a week&#x92;s trial on pain medication prescribed by Dr. Hartman, Nord&#x92;s condition remained unimproved.  Dr. Hartman told Nord to cease work temporarily, and recommended that he consult an orthopedist while continuing to take the pain medication.

				Nord submitted a claim for disability benefits under the Plan, which MetLife denied in February 1998.  Nord next exercised his right to seek further consideration by MetLife&#x92;s &#x93;Group Claims Review.&#x94;  296 F. 3d, at 827.  At that stage, Nord submitted letters and supporting documentation from Dr. Hartman and a treating orthopedist to whom Hartman had referred Nord.  Nord also submitted a questionnaire form, drafted by Nord&#x92;s counsel, headed &#x93;Work Capacity Evaluation.&#x94;  Black &amp; Decker human resources representative Janmarie Forward answered the questions, as the form instructed, by the single word &#x93;yes&#x94; or &#x93;no.&#x94;  One of the six items composing the &#x93;Work Capacity Evaluation&#x94; directed Forward to &#x93;[a]ssume that Kenneth Nord would have a moderate pain that would interfere with his ability to perform intense interpersonal communications or to act appropriately under stress occasionally (up to one-third) during the day.&#x94;  Lodging for Pet. for Cert.

 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  The Act furthers these aims in part by regulating the manner in which plans process benefits claims.  Plans must &#x93;provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied, setting forth the specific reasons for such denial, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/1133.html#1" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. &#xA7;1133(1)</a>.  ERISA further requires that plan procedures &#x93;afford a reasonable opportunity &#x2026; for a full and fair review&#x94; of dispositions adverse to the claimant.  &#xA7;1133(2).  Nothing in the Act itself, however, suggests that plan administrators must accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians.  Nor does the Act impose a heightened burden of explanation on administrators when they reject a treating physician&#x92;s opinion.

				ERISA empowers the Secretary of Labor to &#x93;prescribe such regulations as he finds necessary or appropriate to carry out&#x94; the statutory provisions securing employee benefit rights.  &#xA7;1135; see &#xA7;1133 (plans shall process claims &#x93;[i]n accordance with regulations of the Secretary&#x94;).  The Secretary&#x92;s regulations do not instruct plan administrators to accord extra respect to treating physicians&#x92; opinions.  See

Notably, the most recent version of the Secretary&#x92;s regulations, which installs no treating physician rule, issued more than nine years after the Social Security Administration codified a treating physician rule in that agency&#x92;s regulations.  Compare 56 Fed. Reg. 36932, 36961 (1991), with 65 Fed. Reg. 70265 (2000).

				If the Secretary of Labor found it meet to adopt a treating physician rule by regulation, courts would examine that determination with appropriate deference.  See

				The question whether a treating physician rule would &#x93;increas[e] the accuracy of disability determinations&#x94; under ERISA plans, as the Ninth Circuit believed it would, 
				<em>
					Regula
				</em>
				, 266 F. 3d, at 1139, moreover, seems to us one the Legislature or superintending administrative agency is best positioned to address.  As compared to consultants retained by a plan, it may be true that treating physicians, as a rule, &#x93;ha[ve] a greater opportunity to know and observe the patient as an individual.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Nor do we question the Court of Appeals&#x92; concern that physicians repeatedly retained by benefits plans may have an &#x93;incentive to make a finding of &#x91;not disabled&#x92; in order to save their employers money and to preserve their own consulting arrangements.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 1143.  But the assumption that the opinions of a treating physician warrant greater credit than the opinions of plan consultants may make scant sense when, for example, the relationship between the claimant and the treating physician has been of short duration, or when a specialist engaged by the plan has expertise the treating physician lacks.  And if a consultant engaged by a plan may have an &#x93;incentive&#x94; to make a finding of &#x93;not disabled,&#x94; so a treating physician, in a close case, may favor a finding of &#x93;disabled.&#x94;  Intelligent resolution of the question whether routine deference to the opinion of a claimant&#x92;s treating physician would yield more accurate disability determinations, it thus appears, might be aided by empirical investigation of the kind courts are ill equipped to conduct.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, and of prime importance, critical differences between the Social Security disability program and ERISA benefit plans caution against importing a treating physician rule from the former area into the latter.  The Social Security Act creates a nationwide benefits program funded by Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/3101.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;3101(a)</a>, and superintended by the Commissioner of Social Security.  To cope with the &#x93;more than 2.5 million claims for disability benefits [filed] each year,&#x94;

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">803</a> (1999)
, the Commissioner has published detailed regulations governing benefits adjudications.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 803&#x96;804.  Presumptions employed in the Commissioner&#x92;s regulations &#x93;grow out of the need to administer a large benefits system efficiently.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 804.  By accepting and codifying a treating physician rule, the Commissioner sought to serve that need.  Along with other regulations, the treating physician rule works to foster uniformity and regularity in Social Security benefits determinations made in the first instance by a corps of administrative law judges.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In contrast to the obligatory, nationwide Social Security program, &#x93;[n]othing in ERISA requires employers to establish employee benefits plans.  Nor does ERISA mandate what kind of benefits employers must provide if they choose to have such a plan.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Lockheed Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Spink,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">887</a> (1996)
.  Rather, employers have large leeway to design disability and other welfare plans as they see fit.  In determining entitlement to Social Security benefits, the adjudicator measures the claimant&#x92;s condition against a uniform set of federal criteria.  &#x93;[T]he validity of a claim to benefits under an ERISA plan,&#x94; on the other hand, &#x93;is likely to turn,&#x94; in large part, &#x93;on the interpretation of terms in the plan at issue.&#x94;

				Plan administrators, of course, may not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant&#x92;s reliable evidence, including the opinions of a treating physician.  But, we hold, courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant&#x92;s physician; nor may courts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician&#x92;s evaluation.

Furthermore, there appears to be no uniform practice regarding application of a treating physician rule under state workers&#x92; compensation statutes.  See Conradt v. Mt. Carmel School, 197 Wis. 2d 60, 69, 539 N. W. 2d 713, 717 (Ct.

						 Nord asserts that there are two treating physician rules: a &#x93;procedural&#x94; rule, which requires a hearing officer to explain why she rejected the opinions of a treating physician, and a &#x93;substantive&#x94; rule, which requires that &#x93;more weight&#x94; be given to the medical opinions of a treating physician.

See 296 F. 3d, at 831 (faulting the Plan for, inter alia, having &#x93;[n]o evidence &#x2026; that Nord&#x92;s treating physicians considered inappropriate factors in making their diagnosis or that Nord&#x92;s physicians lacked the requisite expertise to draw their medical conclusions&#x94;).  At any rate, for the reasons explained in this opinion, we conclude that ERISA does not support judicial imposition of a treating physician rule, whether labeled &#x93;procedural&#x94; or &#x93;substantive.&#x94;

				Under a rule adopted by the Commissioner of Social Security, in determining whether a claimant is entitled to Social Security disability benefits, special weight is accorded opinions of the claimant&#x92;s treating physician.  See 20 CFR &#xA7;&#xA7;404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2) (2002).
				  
				This case presents the question whether a similar &#x93;treating physician rule&#x94; applies to disability determinations under employee benefits plans covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA or Act),

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				ERISA and the Secretary of Labor&#x92;s regulations under the Act require &#x93;full and fair&#x94; assessment of claims and clear communication to the claimant of the &#x93;specific reasons&#x94; for benefit denials.  See

But these measures do not command plan administrators to credit the opinions of treating physicians over other evidence relevant to the claimant&#x92;s medical condition.  Because the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit erroneously applied a &#x93;treating physician rule&#x94; to a disability plan governed by ERISA, we vacate that court&#x92;s judgment and remand for further proceedings.

				Petitioner Black &amp; Decker Disability Plan (Plan), an ERISA-governed employee welfare benefit plan, covers employees of Black and Decker Corporation (Black &amp; Decker) and certain of its subsidiaries.  The Plan provides benefits for eligible employees with a &#x93;disability.&#x94;  As relevant here, the Plan defines &#x93;disability&#x94; to mean &#x93;the complete inability &#x2026; of a Participant to engage in his regular occupation with the Employer.&#x94;

Black &amp; Decker both funds the Plan and acts as plan administrator, but it has delegated authority to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) to render initial recommendations on benefit claims.  Disability determinations, the Black &amp; Decker Plan provides, &#x93;[are to] be made by the [plan administrator] based on suitable medical evidence and a review of the Participant&#x92;s employment history that the [plan administrator] deems satisfactory in its sole and absolute discretion.&#x94;

				In 1997, Nord consulted Dr. Leo Hartman about hip and back pain.  Dr. Hartman determined that Nord suffers from a mild degenerative disc disease, a diagnosis confirmed by a Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan.  After a week&#x92;s trial on pain medication prescribed by Dr. Hartman, Nord&#x92;s condition remained unimproved.  Dr. Hartman told Nord to cease work temporarily, and recommended that he consult an orthopedist while continuing to take the pain medication.

				Nord submitted a claim for disability benefits under the Plan, which MetLife denied in February 1998.  Nord next exercised his right to seek further consideration by MetLife&#x92;s &#x93;Group Claims Review.&#x94;  296 F. 3d, at 827.  At that stage, Nord submitted letters and supporting documentation from Dr. Hartman and a treating orthopedist to whom Hartman had referred Nord.  Nord also submitted a questionnaire form, drafted by Nord&#x92;s counsel, headed &#x93;Work Capacity Evaluation.&#x94;  Black &amp; Decker human resources representative Janmarie Forward answered the questions, as the form instructed, by the single word &#x93;yes&#x94; or &#x93;no.&#x94;  One of the six items composing the &#x93;Work Capacity Evaluation&#x94; directed Forward to &#x93;[a]ssume that Kenneth Nord would have a moderate pain that would interfere with his ability to perform intense interpersonal communications or to act appropriately under stress occasionally (up to one-third) during the day.&#x94;  Lodging for Pet. for Cert.

 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  The Act furthers these aims in part by regulating the manner in which plans process benefits claims.  Plans must &#x93;provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied, setting forth the specific reasons for such denial, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant.&#x94;

ERISA further requires that plan procedures &#x93;afford a reasonable opportunity &#x2026; for a full and fair review&#x94; of dispositions adverse to the claimant.  &#xA7;1133(2).  Nothing in the Act itself, however, suggests that plan administrators must accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians.  Nor does the Act impose a heightened burden of explanation on administrators when they reject a treating physician&#x92;s opinion.

				ERISA empowers the Secretary of Labor to &#x93;prescribe such regulations as he finds necessary or appropriate to carry out&#x94; the statutory provisions securing employee benefit rights.  &#xA7;1135; see &#xA7;1133 (plans shall process claims &#x93;[i]n accordance with regulations of the Secretary&#x94;).

Notably, the most recent version of the Secretary&#x92;s regulations, which installs no treating physician rule, issued more than nine years after the Social Security Administration codified a treating physician rule in that agency&#x92;s regulations.  Compare 56 Fed. Reg. 36932, 36961 (1991), with 65 Fed. Reg. 70265 (2000).

				If the Secretary of Labor found it meet to adopt a treating physician rule by regulation, courts would examine that determination with appropriate deference.  See

				The question whether a treating physician rule would &#x93;increas[e] the accuracy of disability determinations&#x94; under ERISA plans, as the Ninth Circuit believed it would, 
				<em>
					Regula
				</em>
				, 266 F. 3d, at 1139, moreover, seems to us one the Legislature or superintending administrative agency is best positioned to address.  As compared to consultants retained by a plan, it may be true that treating physicians, as a rule, &#x93;ha[ve] a greater opportunity to know and observe the patient as an individual.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Nor do we question the Court of Appeals&#x92; concern that physicians repeatedly retained by benefits plans may have an &#x93;incentive to make a finding of &#x91;not disabled&#x92; in order to save their employers money and to preserve their own consulting arrangements.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 1143.  But the assumption that the opinions of a treating physician warrant greater credit than the opinions of plan consultants may make scant sense when, for example, the relationship between the claimant and the treating physician has been of short duration, or when a specialist engaged by the plan has expertise the treating physician lacks.  And if a consultant engaged by a plan may have an &#x93;incentive&#x94; to make a finding of &#x93;not disabled,&#x94; so a treating physician, in a close case, may favor a finding of &#x93;disabled.&#x94;  Intelligent resolution of the question whether routine deference to the opinion of a claimant&#x92;s treating physician would yield more accurate disability determinations, it thus appears, might be aided by empirical investigation of the kind courts are ill equipped to conduct.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, and of prime importance, critical differences between the Social Security disability program and ERISA benefit plans caution against importing a treating physician rule from the former area into the latter.  The Social Security Act creates a nationwide benefits program funded by Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/3101.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;3101(a)</a>, and superintended by the Commissioner of Social Security.  To cope with the &#x93;more than 2.5 million claims for disability benefits [filed] each year,&#x94;

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">803</a> (1999)
, the Commissioner has published detailed regulations governing benefits adjudications.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 803&#x96;804.  Presumptions employed in the Commissioner&#x92;s regulations &#x93;grow out of the need to administer a large benefits system efficiently.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 804.  By accepting and codifying a treating physician rule, the Commissioner sought to serve that need.  Along with other regulations, the treating physician rule works to foster uniformity and regularity in Social Security benefits determinations made in the first instance by a corps of administrative law judges.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In contrast to the obligatory, nationwide Social Security program, &#x93;[n]othing in ERISA requires employers to establish employee benefits plans.  Nor does ERISA mandate what kind of benefits employers must provide if they choose to have such a plan.&#x94;  
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">887</a> (1996)
.  Rather, employers have large leeway to design disability and other welfare plans as they see fit.  In determining entitlement to Social Security benefits, the adjudicator measures the claimant&#x92;s condition against a uniform set of federal criteria.  &#x93;[T]he validity of a claim to benefits under an ERISA plan,&#x94; on the other hand, &#x93;is likely to turn,&#x94; in large part, &#x93;on the interpretation of terms in the plan at issue.&#x94;

				Plan administrators, of course, may not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant&#x92;s reliable evidence, including the opinions of a treating physician.  But, we hold, courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant&#x92;s physician; nor may courts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician&#x92;s evaluation.

Because respondent Nord sought benefits &#x93;for up to 30 months,&#x94; 296 F. 3d 823, 826 (CA9 2002), the standard for longer term disability is not in play in this case.

						 The treating physician rule has not attracted universal adherence outside the Social Security context.  Some courts have approved a rule similar to the Social Security Commissioner&#x92;s for disability determinations under the Longshore and Harbor Workers&#x92; Compensation Act,

Director, Office of Workers&#x92; Compensation Programs, 119 F. 3d 1035, 1042 (CA2 1997), and the Secretary of Labor has adopted a version of the rule for benefit determinations under the Black Lung Benefits Act,

One Court of Appeals, however, has rejected a treating physician rule for the assessment of claims of entitlement to veterans&#x92; benefits for service-connected disabilities, see White v. Principi, 243 F. 3d 1378, 1381 (CAFed 2001), and another has rejected such a rule for disability determinations under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974,

Furthermore, there appears to be no uniform practice regarding application of a treating physician rule under state workers&#x92; compensation statutes.  See Conradt v. Mt. Carmel School, 197 Wis. 2d 60, 69, 539 N. W. 2d 713, 717 (Ct.

						 Nord asserts that there are two treating physician rules: a &#x93;procedural&#x94; rule, which requires a hearing officer to explain why she rejected the opinions of a treating physician, and a &#x93;substantive&#x94; rule, which requires that &#x93;more weight&#x94; be given to the medical opinions of a treating physician.  Brief for Respondent 12&#x96;13 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In this case, Nord contends, the Court of Appeals applied only the &#x93;procedural&#x94; version of the rule.  Id., at 13.  We are not certain that Nord&#x92;s reading of the Court of Appeals decision is correct.  See 296 F. 3d, at 831 (faulting the Plan for, inter alia, having &#x93;[n]o evidence &#x2026; that Nord&#x92;s treating physicians considered inappropriate factors in making their diagnosis or that Nord&#x92;s physicians lacked the requisite expertise to draw their medical conclusions&#x94;).  At any rate, for the reasons explained in this opinion, we conclude that ERISA does not support judicial imposition of a treating physician rule, whether labeled &#x93;procedural&#x94; or &#x93;substantive.&#x94;

				Under a rule adopted by the Commissioner of Social Security, in determining whether a claimant is entitled to Social Security disability benefits, special weight is accorded opinions of the claimant&#x92;s treating physician.  See 20 CFR &#xA7;&#xA7;404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2) (2002).

				ERISA and the Secretary of Labor&#x92;s regulations under the Act require &#x93;full and fair&#x94; assessment of claims and clear communication to the claimant of the &#x93;specific reasons&#x94; for benefit denials.  See

But these measures do not command plan administrators to credit the opinions of treating physicians over other evidence relevant to the claimant&#x92;s medical condition.  Because the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit erroneously applied a &#x93;treating physician rule&#x94; to a disability plan governed by ERISA, we vacate that court&#x92;s judgment and remand for further proceedings.

The Plan provides benefits for eligible employees with a &#x93;disability.&#x94;  As relevant here, the Plan defines &#x93;disability&#x94; to mean &#x93;the complete inability &#x2026; of a Participant to engage in his regular occupation with the Employer.&#x94;

Black &amp; Decker both funds the Plan and acts as plan administrator, but it has delegated authority to Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (MetLife) to render initial recommendations on benefit claims.

				In 1997, Nord consulted Dr. Leo Hartman about hip and back pain.  Dr. Hartman determined that Nord suffers from a mild degenerative disc disease, a diagnosis confirmed by a Magnetic Resonance Imaging scan.  After a week&#x92;s trial on pain medication prescribed by Dr. Hartman, Nord&#x92;s condition remained unimproved.  Dr. Hartman told Nord to cease work temporarily, and recommended that he consult an orthopedist while continuing to take the pain medication.

Nord next exercised his right to seek further consideration by MetLife&#x92;s &#x93;Group Claims Review.&#x94;  296 F. 3d, at 827.  At that stage, Nord submitted letters and supporting documentation from Dr. Hartman and a treating orthopedist to whom Hartman had referred Nord.  Nord also submitted a questionnaire form, drafted by Nord&#x92;s counsel, headed &#x93;Work Capacity Evaluation.&#x94;  Black &amp; Decker human resources representative Janmarie Forward answered the questions, as the form instructed, by the single word &#x93;yes&#x94; or &#x93;no.&#x94;  One of the six items composing the &#x93;Work Capacity Evaluation&#x94; directed Forward to &#x93;[a]ssume that Kenneth Nord would have a moderate pain that would interfere with his ability to perform intense interpersonal communications or to act appropriately under stress occasionally (up to one-third) during the day.&#x94;  Lodging for Pet. for Cert.

Plans must &#x93;provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied, setting forth the specific reasons for such denial, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant.&#x94;

				</em>
				, 266 F. 3d, at 1139, moreover, seems to us one the Legislature or superintending administrative agency is best positioned to address.

				 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Nor do we question the Court of Appeals&#x92; concern that physicians repeatedly retained by benefits plans may have an &#x93;incentive to make a finding of &#x91;not disabled&#x92; in order to save their employers money and to preserve their own consulting arrangements.&#x94;  
				<em>

				, at 1143.  But the assumption that the opinions of a treating physician warrant greater credit than the opinions of plan consultants may make scant sense when, for example, the relationship between the claimant and the treating physician has been of short duration, or when a specialist engaged by the plan has expertise the treating physician lacks.  And if a consultant engaged by a plan may have an &#x93;incentive&#x94; to make a finding of &#x93;not disabled,&#x94; so a treating physician, in a close case, may favor a finding of &#x93;disabled.&#x94;  Intelligent resolution of the question whether routine deference to the opinion of a claimant&#x92;s treating physician would yield more accurate disability determinations, it thus appears, might be aided by empirical investigation of the kind courts are ill equipped to conduct.

				Finally, and of prime importance, critical differences between the Social Security disability program and ERISA benefit plans caution against importing a treating physician rule from the former area into the latter.  The Social Security Act creates a nationwide benefits program funded by Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/3101.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;3101(a)</a>, and superintended by the Commissioner of Social Security.  To cope with the &#x93;more than 2.5 million claims for disability benefits [filed] each year,&#x94;

				<em>

				, at 804.  By accepting and codifying a treating physician rule, the Commissioner sought to serve that need.  Along with other regulations, the treating physician rule works to foster uniformity and regularity in Social Security benefits determinations made in the first instance by a corps of administrative law judges.

				In contrast to the obligatory, nationwide Social Security program, &#x93;[n]othing in ERISA requires employers to establish employee benefits plans.  Nor does ERISA mandate what kind of benefits employers must provide if they choose to have such a plan.&#x94;  
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">887</a> (1996)
.  Rather, employers have large leeway to design disability and other welfare plans as they see fit.  In determining entitlement to Social Security benefits, the adjudicator measures the claimant&#x92;s condition against a uniform set of federal criteria.  &#x93;[T]he validity of a claim to benefits under an ERISA plan,&#x94; on the other hand, &#x93;is likely to turn,&#x94; in large part, &#x93;on the interpretation of terms in the plan at issue.&#x94;

				Plan administrators, of course, may not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant&#x92;s reliable evidence, including the opinions of a treating physician.  But, we hold, courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant&#x92;s physician; nor may courts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician&#x92;s evaluation.

One Court of Appeals, however, has rejected a treating physician rule for the assessment of claims of entitlement to veterans&#x92; benefits for service-connected disabilities, see White v. Principi, 243 F. 3d 1378, 1381 (CAFed 2001), and another has rejected such a rule for disability determinations under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974,

Furthermore, there appears to be no uniform practice regarding application of a treating physician rule under state workers&#x92; compensation statutes.  See Conradt v. Mt. Carmel School, 197 Wis. 2d 60, 69, 539 N. W. 2d 713, 717 (Ct.

						 Nord asserts that there are two treating physician rules: a &#x93;procedural&#x94; rule, which requires a hearing officer to explain why she rejected the opinions of a treating physician, and a &#x93;substantive&#x94; rule, which requires that &#x93;more weight&#x94; be given to the medical opinions of a treating physician.  Brief for Respondent 12&#x96;13 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In this case, Nord contends, the Court of Appeals applied only the &#x93;procedural&#x94; version of the rule.  Id., at 13.  We are not certain that Nord&#x92;s reading of the Court of Appeals decision is correct.  See 296 F. 3d, at 831 (faulting the Plan for, inter alia, having &#x93;[n]o evidence &#x2026; that Nord&#x92;s treating physicians considered inappropriate factors in making their diagnosis or that Nord&#x92;s physicians lacked the requisite expertise to draw their medical conclusions&#x94;).  At any rate, for the reasons explained in this opinion, we conclude that ERISA does not support judicial imposition of a treating physician rule, whether labeled &#x93;procedural&#x94; or &#x93;substantive.&#x94;

				Under a rule adopted by the Commissioner of Social Security, in determining whether a claimant is entitled to Social Security disability benefits, special weight is accorded opinions of the claimant&#x92;s treating physician.  See 20 CFR &#xA7;&#xA7;404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2) (2002).

				ERISA and the Secretary of Labor&#x92;s regulations under the Act require &#x93;full and fair&#x94; assessment of claims and clear communication to the claimant of the &#x93;specific reasons&#x94; for benefit denials.  See

But these measures do not command plan administrators to credit the opinions of treating physicians over other evidence relevant to the claimant&#x92;s medical condition.  Because the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit erroneously applied a &#x93;treating physician rule&#x94; to a disability plan governed by ERISA, we vacate that court&#x92;s judgment and remand for further proceedings.

 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  The Act furthers these aims in part by regulating the manner in which plans process benefits claims.  Plans must &#x93;provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied, setting forth the specific reasons for such denial, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant.&#x94;

ERISA further requires that plan procedures &#x93;afford a reasonable opportunity &#x2026; for a full and fair review&#x94; of dispositions adverse to the claimant.  &#xA7;1133(2).  Nothing in the Act itself, however, suggests that plan administrators must accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians.

Notably, the most recent version of the Secretary&#x92;s regulations, which installs no treating physician rule, issued more than nine years after the Social Security Administration codified a treating physician rule in that agency&#x92;s regulations.

				The question whether a treating physician rule would &#x93;increas[e] the accuracy of disability determinations&#x94; under ERISA plans, as the Ninth Circuit believed it would, 
				<em>
					Regula
				</em>
				, 266 F. 3d, at 1139, moreover, seems to us one the Legislature or superintending administrative agency is best positioned to address.  As compared to consultants retained by a plan, it may be true that treating physicians, as a rule, &#x93;ha[ve] a greater opportunity to know and observe the patient as an individual.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Nor do we question the Court of Appeals&#x92; concern that physicians repeatedly retained by benefits plans may have an &#x93;incentive to make a finding of &#x91;not disabled&#x92; in order to save their employers money and to preserve their own consulting arrangements.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 1143.  But the assumption that the opinions of a treating physician warrant greater credit than the opinions of plan consultants may make scant sense when, for example, the relationship between the claimant and the treating physician has been of short duration, or when a specialist engaged by the plan has expertise the treating physician lacks.  And if a consultant engaged by a plan may have an &#x93;incentive&#x94; to make a finding of &#x93;not disabled,&#x94; so a treating physician, in a close case, may favor a finding of &#x93;disabled.&#x94;  Intelligent resolution of the question whether routine deference to the opinion of a claimant&#x92;s treating physician would yield more accurate disability determinations, it thus appears, might be aided by empirical investigation of the kind courts are ill equipped to conduct.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, and of prime importance, critical differences between the Social Security disability program and ERISA benefit plans caution against importing a treating physician rule from the former area into the latter.  The Social Security Act creates a nationwide benefits program funded by Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/3101.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;3101(a)</a>, and superintended by the Commissioner of Social Security.  To cope with the &#x93;more than 2.5 million claims for disability benefits [filed] each year,&#x94;

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">803</a> (1999)
, the Commissioner has published detailed regulations governing benefits adjudications.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>

				, at 803&#x96;804.  Presumptions employed in the Commissioner&#x92;s regulations &#x93;grow out of the need to administer a large benefits system efficiently.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 804.  By accepting and codifying a treating physician rule, the Commissioner sought to serve that need.  Along with other regulations, the treating physician rule works to foster uniformity and regularity in Social Security benefits determinations made in the first instance by a corps of administrative law judges.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In contrast to the obligatory, nationwide Social Security program, &#x93;[n]othing in ERISA requires employers to establish employee benefits plans.  Nor does ERISA mandate what kind of benefits employers must provide if they choose to have such a plan.&#x94;  
				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">887</a> (1996)
.  Rather, employers have large leeway to design disability and other welfare plans as they see fit.  In determining entitlement to Social Security benefits, the adjudicator measures the claimant&#x92;s condition against a uniform set of federal criteria.  &#x93;[T]he validity of a claim to benefits under an ERISA plan,&#x94; on the other hand, &#x93;is likely to turn,&#x94; in large part, &#x93;on the interpretation of terms in the plan at issue.&#x94;

				Plan administrators, of course, may not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant&#x92;s reliable evidence, including the opinions of a treating physician.  But, we hold, courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant&#x92;s physician; nor may courts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician&#x92;s evaluation.

One Court of Appeals, however, has rejected a treating physician rule for the assessment of claims of entitlement to veterans&#x92; benefits for service-connected disabilities, see White v. Principi, 243 F. 3d 1378, 1381 (CAFed 2001), and another has rejected such a rule for disability determinations under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974,

Furthermore, there appears to be no uniform practice regarding application of a treating physician rule under state workers&#x92; compensation statutes.  See Conradt v. Mt. Carmel School, 197 Wis. 2d 60, 69, 539 N. W. 2d 713, 717 (Ct.

						 Nord asserts that there are two treating physician rules: a &#x93;procedural&#x94; rule, which requires a hearing officer to explain why she rejected the opinions of a treating physician, and a &#x93;substantive&#x94; rule, which requires that &#x93;more weight&#x94; be given to the medical opinions of a treating physician.  Brief for Respondent 12&#x96;13 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In this case, Nord contends, the Court of Appeals applied only the &#x93;procedural&#x94; version of the rule.  Id., at 13.  We are not certain that Nord&#x92;s reading of the Court of Appeals decision is correct.  See 296 F. 3d, at 831 (faulting the Plan for, inter alia, having &#x93;[n]o evidence &#x2026; that Nord&#x92;s treating physicians considered inappropriate factors in making their diagnosis or that Nord&#x92;s physicians lacked the requisite expertise to draw their medical conclusions&#x94;).  At any rate, for the reasons explained in this opinion, we conclude that ERISA does not support judicial imposition of a treating physician rule, whether labeled &#x93;procedural&#x94; or &#x93;substantive.&#x94;

				Under a rule adopted by the Commissioner of Social Security, in determining whether a claimant is entitled to Social Security disability benefits, special weight is accorded opinions of the claimant&#x92;s treating physician.  See 20 CFR &#xA7;&#xA7;404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2) (2002).

				ERISA and the Secretary of Labor&#x92;s regulations under the Act require &#x93;full and fair&#x94; assessment of claims and clear communication to the claimant of the &#x93;specific reasons&#x94; for benefit denials.  See

But these measures do not command plan administrators to credit the opinions of treating physicians over other evidence relevant to the claimant&#x92;s medical condition.

 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  The Act furthers these aims in part by regulating the manner in which plans process benefits claims.  Plans must &#x93;provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied, setting forth the specific reasons for such denial, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant.&#x94;  
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/1133.html#1" class="subref" title="subref">29 U. S. C. &#xA7;1133(1)</a>.  ERISA further requires that plan procedures &#x93;afford a reasonable opportunity &#x2026; for a full and fair review&#x94; of dispositions adverse to the claimant.  &#xA7;1133(2).  Nothing in the Act itself, however, suggests that plan administrators must accord special deference to the opinions of treating physicians.  Nor does the Act impose a heightened burden of explanation on administrators when they reject a treating physician&#x92;s opinion.

        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				ERISA empowers the Secretary of Labor to &#x93;prescribe such regulations as he finds necessary or appropriate to carry out&#x94; the statutory provisions securing employee benefit rights.  &#xA7;1135; see &#xA7;1133 (plans shall process claims &#x93;[i]n accordance with regulations of the Secretary&#x94;).  The Secretary&#x92;s regulations do not instruct plan administrators to accord extra respect to treating physicians&#x92; opinions.  See

Notably, the most recent version of the Secretary&#x92;s regulations, which installs no treating physician rule, issued more than nine years after the Social Security Administration codified a treating physician rule in that agency&#x92;s regulations.  Compare 56 Fed. Reg. 36932, 36961 (1991), with 65 Fed. Reg. 70265 (2000).
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				If the Secretary of Labor found it meet to adopt a treating physician rule by regulation, courts would examine that determination with appropriate deference.  See 
				<em>

				 v. 
				<em>

.  The Secretary has not chosen that course, however, and an 
				<em>

				 brief reflecting the position of the Department of Labor opposes adoption of such a rule for disability determinations under plans covered by ERISA.  See Brief for United States as

				The question whether a treating physician rule would &#x93;increas[e] the accuracy of disability determinations&#x94; under ERISA plans, as the Ninth Circuit believed it would, 
				<em>
					Regula
				</em>
				, 266 F. 3d, at 1139, moreover, seems to us one the Legislature or superintending administrative agency is best positioned to address.  As compared to consultants retained by a plan, it may be true that treating physicians, as a rule, &#x93;ha[ve] a greater opportunity to know and observe the patient as an individual.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Ibid.
				</em>
				 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  Nor do we question the Court of Appeals&#x92; concern that physicians repeatedly retained by benefits plans may have an &#x93;incentive to make a finding of &#x91;not disabled&#x92; in order to save their employers money and to preserve their own consulting arrangements.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 1143.  But the assumption that the opinions of a treating physician warrant greater credit than the opinions of plan consultants may make scant sense when, for example, the relationship between the claimant and the treating physician has been of short duration, or when a specialist engaged by the plan has expertise the treating physician lacks.  And if a consultant engaged by a plan may have an &#x93;incentive&#x94; to make a finding of &#x93;not disabled,&#x94; so a treating physician, in a close case, may favor a finding of &#x93;disabled.&#x94;  Intelligent resolution of the question whether routine deference to the opinion of a claimant&#x92;s treating physician would yield more accurate disability determinations, it thus appears, might be aided by empirical investigation of the kind courts are ill equipped to conduct.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				Finally, and of prime importance, critical differences between the Social Security disability program and ERISA benefit plans caution against importing a treating physician rule from the former area into the latter.  The Social Security Act creates a nationwide benefits program funded by Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments, see 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/3101.html#a" class="subref" title="subref">26 U. S. C. &#xA7;&#xA7;3101(a)</a>, and superintended by the Commissioner of Social Security.  To cope with the &#x93;more than 2.5 million claims for disability benefits [filed] each year,&#x94; 
				<em>
					Cleveland
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Policy Management Systems Corp.,

 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">803</a> (1999)
, the Commissioner has published detailed regulations governing benefits adjudications.  See, 
				<em>
					e.g.,
				</em>
            <em>
					id.
				</em>
				, at 803&#x96;804.  Presumptions employed in the Commissioner&#x92;s regulations &#x93;grow out of the need to administer a large benefits system efficiently.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Id.
				</em>
				, at 804.  By accepting and codifying a treating physician rule, the Commissioner sought to serve that need.  Along with other regulations, the treating physician rule works to foster uniformity and regularity in Social Security benefits determinations made in the first instance by a corps of administrative law judges.
			</p>
        <p class="bodytext">
				


				    
				In contrast to the obligatory, nationwide Social Security program, &#x93;[n]othing in ERISA requires employers to establish employee benefits plans.  Nor does ERISA mandate what kind of benefits employers must provide if they choose to have such a plan.&#x94;  
				<em>
					Lockheed Corp.
				</em>
				 v. 
				<em>
					Spink,
				</em>
            <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/517/882" class="subref" title="subref">517 U. S. 882</a>, 
 <a title="sorry, not yet linked" class="">887</a> (1996)
.  Rather, employers have large leeway to design disability and other welfare plans as they see fit.  In determining entitlement to Social Security benefits, the adjudicator measures the claimant&#x92;s condition against a uniform set of federal criteria.  &#x93;[T]he validity of a claim to benefits under an ERISA plan,&#x94; on the other hand, &#x93;is likely to turn,&#x94; in large part, &#x93;on the interpretation of terms in the plan at issue.&#x94;

				Plan administrators, of course, may not arbitrarily refuse to credit a claimant&#x92;s reliable evidence, including the opinions of a treating physician.  But, we hold, courts have no warrant to require administrators automatically to accord special weight to the opinions of a claimant&#x92;s physician; nor may courts impose on plan administrators a discrete burden of explanation when they credit reliable evidence that conflicts with a treating physician&#x92;s evaluation.

						 The treating physician rule has not attracted universal adherence outside the Social Security context.  Some courts have approved a rule similar to the Social Security Commissioner&#x92;s for disability determinations under the Longshore and Harbor Workers&#x92; Compensation Act, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/33/901.html" class="subref" title="subref">33 U. S. C. &#xA7;901</a> et seq., see, e.g., Pietrunti v. Director, Office of Workers&#x92; Compensation Programs, 119 F. 3d 1035, 1042 (CA2 1997), and the Secretary of Labor has adopted a version of the rule for benefit determinations under the Black Lung Benefits Act,

One Court of Appeals, however, has rejected a treating physician rule for the assessment of claims of entitlement to veterans&#x92; benefits for service-connected disabilities, see White v. Principi, 243 F. 3d 1378, 1381 (CAFed 2001), and another has rejected such a rule for disability determinations under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974,

Furthermore, there appears to be no uniform practice regarding application of a treating physician rule under state workers&#x92; compensation statutes.  See Conradt v. Mt. Carmel School, 197 Wis. 2d 60, 69, 539 N. W. 2d 713, 717 (Ct. App. 1995) (&#x93;Conradt misrepresents the state of the law when she claims that a majority of states have adopted the &#x91;treating physician rule.&#x92; &#x94;).

						 Nord asserts that there are two treating physician rules: a &#x93;procedural&#x94; rule, which requires a hearing officer to explain why she rejected the opinions of a treating physician, and a &#x93;substantive&#x94; rule, which requires that &#x93;more weight&#x94; be given to the medical opinions of a treating physician.  Brief for Respondent 12&#x96;13 (internal quotation marks omitted).  In this case, Nord contends, the Court of Appeals applied only the &#x93;procedural&#x94; version of the rule.  Id., at 13.  We are not certain that Nord&#x92;s reading of the Court of Appeals decision is correct.  See 296 F. 3d, at 831 (faulting the Plan for, inter alia, having &#x93;[n]o evidence &#x2026; that Nord&#x92;s treating physicians considered inappropriate factors in making their diagnosis or that Nord&#x92;s physicians lacked the requisite expertise to draw their medical conclusions&#x94;).  At any rate, for the reasons explained in this opinion, we conclude that ERISA does not support judicial imposition of a treating physician rule, whether labeled &#x93;procedural&#x94; or &#x93;substantive.&#x94;
