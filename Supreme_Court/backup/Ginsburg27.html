    <p class="pro-indent">During the years at issue in these consolidated cases, California used a "worldwide combined reporting" method to determine the corporate franchise tax owed by unitary multinational corporate group members doing business in California. California's method first looked to the worldwide income of the unitary business, and then taxed a percentage of that income equal to the average of the proportions of worldwide payroll, property, and sales located within California. In contrast, the Federal Government employs a "separate accounting" method, which treats each corporate entity discretely for the purpose of determining income tax liability. In Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/463/159" class="subref" title="463 U.S. 159, 103 S.Ct. 2933, 77 L.Ed.2d 545">463 U.S. 159, 103 S.Ct. 2933, 77 L.Ed.2d 545</a> this Court upheld the California scheme as applied to domestic-based multinationals, but did not address the constitutionality of the scheme as applied to domestic corporations with foreign parents or to foreign corporations with foreign parents or foreign subsidiaries. Both petitioner Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays) &#x97; a foreign multinational &#x97; and petitioner Colgate-Palmolive Co. (Colgate) &#x97; a domestic multinational &#x97; have operations in California. In separate cases, two members of the Barclays group and Colgate were denied refunds by the California authorities.</p>

California's tax easily meets all but the third of the Complete Auto criteria. As to the third, Barclays has not shown that the system in fact operates to impose inordinate compliance burdens on foreign enterprises, and its claim of unconstitutional discrimination against foreign commerce thus fails. Pp. ____.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">(b) Nor has Barclays shown that California's "reasonable approximations" method of reducing the compliance burden is incompatible with due process. Barclays argues that California employs no standard to determine what approximations will be accepted, but Barclays has presented no example of an approximation California rejected as unreasonable. Furthermore, the state judiciary has construed California law to curtail the discretion of state tax officials, and the State has afforded Barclays the opportunity to seek clarification of the meaning of the relevant regulations. Rules governing international multijurisdictional income allocation have an inescapable imprecision given the subject matter's complexity, and rules against vagueness are not mechanically applied; rather, their application is tied to the nature of the enactment. Pp. ____.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">(c) California's system does not expose foreign multinationals, such as Barclays, to constitutionally intolerable multiple taxation. In the face of a similar challenge, Container Corp. approved this very tax when applied to a domestic-based multinational. The considerations that informed the Container Corp. decision are not dispositively diminished when the tax is applied to a foreign-based enterprise. Multiple taxation is not the inevitable result of California's tax, and the alternative reasonably available to the State &#x97; separate accounting &#x97; cannot eliminate, and in some cases may even enhance, the risk of double taxation. Pp. ____.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">(d) California's scheme also does not prevent the Federal Government from speaking with "one voice" in international trade. Congress holds the control rein in this area. In the 11 years since Container Corp., Congress has not barred States from using the worldwide combined reporting method. In the past three decades, aware that foreign governments deplored use of the method, Congress nevertheless failed to enact any of numerous bills, or to ratify a treaty provision, that would have prohibited the practice. Executive Branch actions, statements, and amicus filings do not supply the requisite federal directive proscribing States' use of worldwide combined reporting, for the regulatory authority is Congress' to wield. Executive Branch communications that express federal policy but lack the force of law cannot render unconstitutional California's otherwise valid, congressionally condoned scheme. Pp. ____.</p>

    <p class="pro-indent">Justice GINSBURG delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Eleven years ago, in Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Bd., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/463/159" class="subref" title="463 U.S. 159, 103 S.Ct. 2933, 77 L.Ed.2d 545 (1983)">463 U.S. 159, 103 S.Ct. 2933, 77 L.Ed.2d 545 (1983)</a>, this Court upheld California's income-based corporate franchise tax, as applied to a multinational enterprise, against a comprehensive challenge made under the Due Process and Commerce Clauses of the Federal Constitution. Container Corp. involved a corporate taxpayer domiciled and headquartered in the United States; in addition to its stateside components, the taxpayer had a number of overseas subsidiaries incorporated in the countries in which they operated. The Court's decision in Container Corp. did not address the constitutionality of California's taxing scheme as applied to "domestic corporations with foreign parents or to foreign corporations with either foreign parents or foreign subsidiaries." 
Id., at 189, n. 26, 103 S.Ct., at 2952 n. 26. In the consolidated cases before us, we return to the taxing scheme earlier considered in Container Corp. and resolve matters left open in that case.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">The petitioner in No. 92-1384, Barclays Bank PLC (Barclays), is a United Kingdom corporation in the Barclays Group, a multinational banking enterprise. The petitioner in No. 92-1839, Colgate-Palmolive Co. (Colgate), is the United States-based parent of a multinational manufacturing and sales enterprise. Each enterprise has operations in California. During the years here at issue, California determined the state corporate franchise tax due for these operations under a method known as "worldwide combined reporting." California's scheme first looked to the worldwide income of the multinational enterprise, and then attributed a portion of that income (equal to the average of the proportions of worldwide payroll, property, and sales located in California) to the California operations. The State imposed its tax on the income thus attributed to Barclays' and Colgate's California business.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Barclays urges that California's tax system distinctively burdens foreign-based multinationals and results in double international taxation, in violation of the Commerce and Due Process Clauses. Both Barclays and Colgate contend that the scheme offends the Commerce Clause by frustrating the Federal Government's ability to "speak with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments." Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/441/434" class="subref" title="441 U.S. 434, 449, 99 S.Ct. 1813, 1822, 60 L.Ed.2d 336 (1979)">441 U.S. 434, 449, 99 S.Ct. 1813, 1822, 60 L.Ed.2d 336 (1979)</a> (internal quotation marks omitted). We reject these arguments, and hold that the Constitution does not impede application of California's corporate franchise tax to Barclays and Colgate. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the California Court of Appeal.</p>

    <p class="pro-indent">One means of deriving locally taxable income, generally used by States that collect corporate income-based taxes, is the "unitary business" method. As explained in Container Corp., unitary taxation "rejects geographical or transactional accounting," which is "subject to manipulation" and does not fully capture "the many subtle and largely unquantifiable transfers of value that take place among the components of a single enterprise." 
Id., at 164-165, 103 S.Ct., at 2940. The "unitary business/formula apportionment" method</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">"calculates the local tax base by first defining the scope of the 'unitary business' of which the taxed enterprise's activities in the taxing jurisdiction form one part, and then apportioning the total income of that 'unitary business' between the taxing jurisdiction and the rest of the world on the basis of a formula taking into account objective measures of the corporation's activities within and without the jurisdiction."

    <p class="pro-indent">During the income years at issue in these cases &#x97; 1977 for Barclays, 1970-1973 for Colgate &#x97; California assessed its corporate franchise tax by employing a "worldwide combined reporting" method. California's scheme required the taxpayer to aggregate the income of all corporate entities composing the unitary business enterprise, including in the aggregation both affiliates operating abroad and those operating within the United States. Having defined the scope of the "unitary business" thus broadly, California used a long-accepted method of apportionment, commonly called the "three-factor" formula, to arrive at the amount of income attributable to the operations of the enterprise in California. Under the three-factor formula, California taxed a percentage of worldwide income equal to the arithmetic average of the proportions of worldwide payroll, property, and sales located inside the State. Cal.Rev. &amp; Tax.Code Ann. &#xA7; 25128 (West 1992). Thus, if a unitary business had 8% of its payroll, 3% of its property, and 4% of its sales in California, the State took the average &#x97; 5% &#x97; and imposed its tax on that percentage of the business' total income.<a name="fn2_ref" href="#fn2" class="">

    <p class="pro-indent">The corporate income tax imposed by the United States employs a "separate accounting" method, a means of apportioning income among taxing sovereigns used by all major developed nations. In contrast to combined reporting, separate accounting treats each corporate entity discretely for the purpose of determining income tax liability.<a name="fn3_ref" href="#fn3" class="">

    <p class="pro-indent">Separate accounting poses the risk that a conglomerate will manipulate transfers of value among its components to minimize its total tax liability. To guard against such manipulation, transactions between affiliated corporations must be scrutinized to ensure that they are reported on an "arm's length" basis, i.e., at a price reflecting their true market value.

    <p class="pro-indent">At one time, a number of States used worldwide combined reporting, as California did during the years at issue. In recent years, such States, including California, have modified their systems at least to allow corporate election of some variant of an approach that confines combined reporting to the United States' "water's edge." See 1 Hellerstein &amp; Hellerstein, supra n. 1, &#xB6; 8.16, pp. 8-185 to 8-187. California's 1986 modification of its corporate franchise tax, effective in 1988, 1986 Cal.Stats., ch. 660, &#xA7; 6, made it nearly the last State to give way. 1 Hellerstein &amp; Hellerstein, supra n. 1, &#xB6; 8.16, p. 8-187.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">California corporate taxpayers, under the State's water's edge alternative, may elect to limit their combined reporting group to corporations in the unitary business whose individual presence in the United States surpasses a certain threshold. Cal.Rev. &amp; Tax.Code Ann. &#xA7; 25110 (West 1992); see Leegstra, Eager, &amp; Stolte, The California Water's-Edge Election, 6 J. of St. Tax. 195 (1987) (explaining operation of California's water's edge system). The 1986 amendment conditioned a corporate group's water's edge election on payment of a substantial fee, and allowed the California Franchise Tax Board (Tax Board) to disregard a water's edge election under certain circumstances. In 1993, California again modified its corporate franchise tax statute, this time to allow domestic and foreign enterprises to elect water's edge treatment without payment of a fee and without the threat of disregard. 1993 Cal.Stats., ch. 31, &#xA7; 53; 1993 Cal.Stats., ch. 881, &#xA7; 22. See Cal.Rev. &amp; Tax.Code Ann. &#xA7; 25110 (West Supp.1994). The new amendments became effective in January 1994.</p>

    <p class="pro-indent">The first of these consolidated cases, No. 92-1384, is a tax refund suit brought by two members of the Barclays Group, a multinational banking enterprise. Based in the United Kingdom, the Barclays Group includes more than 220 corporations doing business in some 60 nations. The two refund-seeking members of the Barclays corporate family did business in California and were therefore subject to California's franchise tax. Barclays Bank of California (Barcal), one of the two taxpayers, was a California banking corporation wholly owned by Barclays Bank International Limited (BBI), the second taxpayer. BBI, a United Kingdom corporation, did business in the United Kingdom and in more than 33 other nations and territories.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">In computing its California franchise tax based on 1977 income, Barcal reported only the income from its own operations. BBI reported income on the assumption that it participated in a unitary business composed of itself and its subsidiaries, but not its parent corporation and the parent's other subsidiaries. After auditing BBI's and Barcal's 1977 income year franchise tax returns, the Tax Board, respondent here, determined that both were part of a worldwide unitary business, the Barclays Group. Ultimately, the Board assessed additional tax liability of $1,678 for BBI and $152,420 for Barcal.<a name="fn6_ref" href="#fn6" class="">

    <p class="pro-indent">Barcal and BBI paid the assessments and sued for refunds. They prevailed in California's lower courts, but were unsuccessful in California's Supreme Court. The California Supreme Court held that the tax did not impair the Federal Government's ability to "speak with one voice" in regulating foreign commerce, see Japan Line, Ltd. v.

Having so concluded, the California Supreme Court remanded the case to the Court of Appeal for further development of Barclays' claim that the compliance burden on foreign-based multinationals imposed by California's tax violated both the Due Process Clause and the nondiscrimination requirement of the Commerce Clause.

When Colgate filed California franchise tax returns based on 1970-1973 income, it reported the income earned from its foreign operations on a separate accounting basis. Essentially, Colgate maintained that the Constitution compelled California to limit the reach of its unitary principle to the United States' water's edge. See supra, at ____.

    <p class="pro-indent">California's worldwide combined reporting system easily meets three of the four Complete Auto criteria. The nexus requirement is met by the business all three taxpayers &#x97; Barcal, BBI, and Colgate &#x97; did in California during the years in question. See Mobil Oil Corp. v.

        </a> The "fair apportionment" standard is also satisfied. Neither Barclays nor Colgate has demonstrated the lack of a "rational relationship between the income attributed to the State and the intrastate values of the enterprise," Container Corp., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/463/0" class="subref" title="463 U.S., at 180-181, 103 S.Ct., at 2948">463 U.S., at 180-181, 103 S.Ct., at 2948</a> (internal quotation marks omitted); nor have the petitioners shown that the income attributed to California is "out of all appropriate proportion to the business transacted by the taxpayers in that State."

Id., at 169, 103 S.Ct., at 2942. And surely California has afforded Colgate and the Barclays taxpayers "protection, opportunities and benefits" for which the State can exact a return. Wisconsin v. J.C. Penney Co.,

    <p class="pro-indent">Barclays (but not Colgate) vigorously contends, however, that California's worldwide combined reporting scheme violates the antidiscrimination component of the Complete Auto test. Barclays maintains that a foreign-owner of a taxpayer filing a California tax return "is forced to convert its diverse financial and accounting records from around the world into the language, currency, and accounting principles of the United States" at "prohibitive" expense. Brief for Petitioner in No. 92-1384, p. 44.<a name="fn11_ref" href="#fn11" class="">

                <b>11</b>
            </sup>
        </a> Domestic-owned taxpayers, by contrast, need not incur such expense because they "already keep most of their records in English, in United States currency, and in accord with United States accounting principles." Id., at 45. Barclays urges that imposing this "prohibitive administrative burden," 
id., at 43, on foreign-owned enterprises gives a competitive advantage to their U.S.-owned counterparts and constitutes "economic protectionism" of the kind this Court has often condemned. Id., at 43-46.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Compliance burdens, if disproportionately imposed on out-of-jurisdiction enterprises, may indeed be inconsonant with the Commerce Clause. See, e.g., Hunt v. Washington State Apple Advertising Comm'n, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/432/333" class="subref" title="432 U.S. 333, 350-351, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2445, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977)">432 U.S. 333, 350-351, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2445, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977)</a> (increased costs imposed by North Carolina statute on out-of-state apple producers "would tend to shield the local apple industry from the competition of Washington apple growers," thereby discriminating against those growers). The factual predicate of Barclays' discrimination claim, however, is infirm.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Barclays points to provisions of California's implementing regulations setting out three discrete means for a taxpayer to fulfill its franchise tax reporting requirements. Each of these modes of compliance would require Barclays to gather and present much information not maintained by the unitary group in the ordinary course of business.<a name="fn12_ref" href="#fn12" class="">
            <sup>
                <b>12</b>
            </sup>
        </a> California's regulations, however, also provide that the Tax Board "shall consider the effort and expense required to obtain the necessary information" and, in "appropriate cases, such as when the necessary data cannot be developed from financial records maintained in the regular course of business," may accept "reasonable approximations." Cal.Code of Regs., Title 18, &#xA7; 25137-6(e)(1) (1985). As the Court of Appeal comprehended, in determining Barclays' 1977 worldwide income, Barclays and the Tax Board "used these latter provisions and made computations based on reasonable approximations," 10 Cal.App.4th 1742, 1756, 14 Cal.Rptr.2d 537, 545 (3d Dist.1992), thus allowing Barclays to avoid the large compliance costs of which it complains.<a name="fn13_ref" href="#fn13" class="">
            <sup>
                <b>13</b>
            </sup>
        </a> Barclays has not shown that California's provision for "reasonable approximations" systematically "overtaxes" foreign corporations generally or BBI or Barcal in particular.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">In sum, Barclays has not demonstrated that California's tax system in fact operates to impose inordinate compliance burdens on foreign enterprises. Barclays' claim of unconstitutional discrimination against foreign commerce therefore fails.</p>
    <p class="pro-para">III</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Barclays additionally argues that California's "reasonable approximations" method of reducing the compliance burden is incompatible with due process. "Foreign multinationals," Barclays maintains, "remain at peril in filing their tax returns because there is no standard to determine what 'approximations' will be accepted." Brief for Petitioner in No. 92-1384, p. 49. Barclays presents no substantive grievance concerning the treatment it has received, i.e., no example of an approximation rejected by the Tax Board as unreasonable. Barclays instead complains that "the grant of standardless discretion itself violates due process," so that the taxpayer need not show "actual harm from arbitrary application." Ibid.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">We note, initially, that "reasonableness" is a guide admitting effective judicial review in myriad settings, from encounters between the police and the citizenry, see Terry v. Ohio,

    <p class="pro-indent">We next observe that California's judiciary has construed the California law to curtail the discretion of California tax officials. See 10 Cal.App.4th, at 1762, 14 Cal.Rptr.2d, at 549 (the Tax Board must consider "regularly-maintained or other readily-accessibly corporate documents" in deciding whether the "cost and effort of producing worldwide combined reporting information" justifies submission of "reasonable approximations"). We note, furthermore, that California has afforded Barclays the opportunity "to clarify the meaning of the regulations by its own inquiry, or by resort to an administrative process." See Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.,

    <p class="pro-indent">In Container Corp., we upheld application of California's combined reporting obligation to "foreign subsidiaries of domestic corporations,"

        </a> Barclays contends that its situation compels a different outcome, because application of the combined reporting obligation to foreign multinationals creates a " 'more aggravated' risk . . . of double taxation." Brief for Petitioner in No. 92-1384, p. 32, quoting Nos. 325059 and 325061 (Super.Ct. Sacramento County, Aug. 20, 1987) (reprinted in App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 92-1384, p. A-26). Barclays rests its argument on the observation that "foreign multinationals typically have more of their operations and entities outside of the United States compared to domestic multinationals, which typically have a smaller share of their operations and entities outside of the United States." Id., at 33.<a name="fn16_ref" href="#fn16" class="">

                <b>16</b>
            </sup>
        </a> As a result, a higher proportion of the income of a foreign multinational is subject to taxation by foreign sovereigns. This reality, Barclays concludes, means that for the foreign multinational, which must include all its foreign operations in the California combined reporting group, "the breadth of double taxation and the degree of burden on foreign commerce are greater than in the case of domestic multinationals." Ibid.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">We do not question Barclays' assertion that multinational enterprises with a high proportion of income taxed by jurisdictions with wage rates, property values, and sales prices lower than California's face a correspondingly high risk of multiple international taxation. See Container Corp., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/463/0" class="subref" title="463 U.S., at 187, 103 S.Ct., at 2951-2952">463 U.S., at 187, 103 S.Ct., at 2951-2952</a>; cf. 
id., at 199-200, 103 S.Ct., at 2958 (Powell, J., dissenting) (describing how formulary apportionment leads to multiple taxation). Nor do we question that foreign-based multinationals have a higher proportion of such income, on average, than do their United States counterparts. But Container Corp.'s approval of this very tax, in the face of a multiple taxation challenge, did not rest on any insufficiency in the evidence that multiple taxation might occur; indeed, we accepted in that case the taxpayer's assertion that multiple taxation in fact had occurred. Id., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/463/0" class="subref" title="463 U.S., at 187, 103 S.Ct., at 2951">463 U.S., at 187, 103 S.Ct., at 2951</a> ("The tax imposed here, like the tax in Japan Line, has resulted in actual double taxation, in the sense that some of the income taxed without apportionment by foreign nations as attributable to appellant's foreign subsidiaries was also taxed by California as attributable to the State's share of the total income of the unitary business of which those subsidiaries are a part."); see also 
id., at 187, n. 22, 103 S.Ct., at 2951, n. 22.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Container Corp.'s holding on multiple taxation relied on two considerations: first, that multiple taxation was not the "inevitable result" of the California tax;<a name="fn17_ref" href="#fn17" class="">
            <sup>
                <b>17</b>
            </sup>
        </a> and, second, that the "alternative reasonably available to the taxing State" (i.e., some version of the separate accounting/"arm's length" approach), 
id., at 188-189, 103 S.Ct., at 2952, "could not eliminate the risk of double taxation" and might in some cases enhance that risk. 
Id., at 191, 103 S.Ct. at 2954.<a name="fn18_ref" href="#fn18" class="">
            <sup>
                <b>18</b>
            </sup>
        </a> We underscored that "even though most nations have adopted the arm's-length approach in its general outlines, the precise rules under which they reallocate income among affiliated corporations often differ substantially, and whenever that difference exists, the possibility of double taxation also exists." Ibid. (emphasis added); see also 
id., at 192, 103 S.Ct. at 2954 ("California would have trouble avoiding multiple taxation even if it adopted the 'arm's-length' approach. . . .").</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">These considerations are not dispositively diminished when California's tax is applied to the components of foreign, as opposed to domestic, multinationals. Multiple taxation of such entities because of California's scheme is not "inevitable"; the existence vel non of actual multiple taxation of income remains, as in Container Corp., dependent "on the facts of the individual case." 
Id., at 188, 103 S.Ct., at 2952. And if, as we have held, adoption of a separate accounting system does not dispositively lessen the risk of multiple taxation of the income earned by foreign affiliates of domestic-owned corporations, we see no reason why it would do so in respect of the income earned by foreign affiliates of foreign-owned corporations. We refused in Container Corp. "to require California to give up one allocation method that sometimes results in double taxation in favor of another allocation method that also sometimes results in double taxation." 
Id., at 193, 103 S.Ct., at 2955. The foreign domicile of the taxpayer (or the taxpayer's parent) is a factor inadequate to warrant retraction of that position.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Recognizing that multiple taxation of international enterprise may occur whatever taxing scheme the State adopts, the dissent finds impermissible under "the dormant Foreign Commerce Clause" only double taxation that (1) burdens a foreign corporation, in need of protection for lack of access to the political process, and (2) occurs "because the State does not conform to international practice." Post, at ____. But the image of a politically impotent foreign transactor is surely belied by the battalion of foreign governments that has marched to Barclays' aid, deploring worldwide combined reporting in diplomatic notes, amicus briefs, and even retaliatory legislation. See infra, at ____, n. 22; post, at ____. Indeed, California responded to this impressive political activity when it eliminated mandatory worldwide combined reporting. See supra, at ____. In view of this activity, and the control rein Congress holds, see infra, at ____, we cannot agree that "international practice" has such force as to dictate this Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence. We therefore adhere to the precedent set in Container Corp.</p>
    <p class="pro-para">B</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">We turn, finally, to the question ultimately and most energetically presented: Did California's worldwide combined reporting requirement, as applied to Barcal, BBI, and Colgate, "impair federal uniformity in an area where federal uniformity is essential," Japan Line,

    <p class="pro-indent">"First, there is no claim here that the federal tax statutes themselves provide the necessary pre-emptive force. Second, although the United States is a party to a great number of tax treaties that require the Federal Government to adopt some form of 'arm's-length' analysis in taxing the domestic income of multinational enterprises, that requirement is generally waived with respect to the taxes imposed by each of the contracting nations on its own domestic corporations. . . . Third, the tax treaties into which the United States has entered do not generally cover the taxing activities of subnational governmental units such as States, and in none of the treaties does the restriction on 'non-arm's-length' methods of taxation apply to the States. Moreover, the Senate has on at least one occasion, in considering a proposed treaty, attached a reservation declining to give its consent to a provision in the treaty that would have extended that restriction to the States. Finally, . . . Congress has long debated, but has not enacted, legislation designed to regulate state taxation of income."

    <p class="pro-indent">The Court again confronted a "one voice" argument in Wardair Canada, Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Revenue, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/477/1" class="subref" title="477 U.S. 1, 106 S.Ct. 2369, 91 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986)">477 U.S. 1, 106 S.Ct. 2369, 91 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986)</a>, and there rejected a Commerce Clause challenge to Florida's tax on the sale of fuel to common carriers, including airlines. Air carriers were taxed on all aviation fuel purchased in Florida, without regard to the amount the carrier consumed within the State or the amount of its in-state business. The carrier in Wardair, a Canadian airline that operated charter flights to and from the United States, conceded that the challenged tax satisfied the Complete Auto criteria and entailed no threat of multiple international taxation. Joined by the United States as amicus curiae, however, the carrier urged that Florida's tax "threatened the ability of the Federal Government to 'speak with one voice.' " 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/477/0" class="subref" title="477 U.S., at 9, 106 S.Ct., at 2373">477 U.S., at 9, 106 S.Ct., at 2373</a>. There is "a federal policy," the carrier asserted, "of reciprocal tax exemptions for aircraft, equipment, and supplies, including aviation fuel, that constitute the instrumentalities of international air traffic"; this policy, the carrier argued, "represents the statement that the 'one voice' of the Federal Government wishes to make," a statement "threatened by Florida's tax." Ibid.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">This Court disagreed, observing that the proffered evidence disclosed no federal policy of the kind described and indeed demonstrated that the Federal Government intended to permit the States to impose sales taxes on aviation fuel. The international convention and resolution and more than 70 bilateral treaties on which the carrier relied to show a United States policy of tax exemption for the instrumentalities of international air traffic, the Court explained, in fact indicated far less: "While there appears to be an international aspiration on the one hand to eliminate all impediments to foreign air travel &#x97; including taxation of fuel &#x97; the law as it presently stands acquiesces in taxation of the sale of that fuel by political subdivisions of countries." 
Id., at 10, 106 S.Ct., at 2374 (emphasis in original). Most of the bilateral agreements prohibited the Federal Government from imposing national taxes on aviation fuel used by foreign carriers, but none prohibited the States or their subdivisions from taxing the sale of fuel to foreign airlines. The Court concluded that "by negative implication arising out of these international accords, the United States has at least acquiesced in state taxation of fuel used by foreign carriers in international travel," and therefore upheld Florida's tax.

But because the State and private parties have justifiably relied on the constitutionality of taxing such corporations, and Congress has not seen fit to override our decision, I agree with the Court that Container Corp. should not be overruled, cf. Quill Corp. v. North Dakota ex rel. Heitkamp, 504 U.S. ----, ----, 
112 S.Ct. 1904, 1916, 119 L.Ed.2d 91 (1992) (slip op., at 18-19), and that it resolves the constitutional challenge raised by Colgate-Palmolive. I therefore concur in the judgment in No. 92-1839. Barclays Bank, on the other hand, is a foreign-based parent company of a multinational corporate group, and our holding in Container Corp. expressly does not extend to this situation. See

    <p class="pro-indent">A state tax on interstate commerce must meet four requirements under our negative Commerce Clause precedents: the tax must be on an activity with a substantial nexus to the taxing State, it must be fairly apportioned, it must not discriminate against interstate commerce, and it must be fairly related to the services provided by the State.

Substantially for the reasons explained by the Court, see ante, at ____, I agree that imposition of the California tax complies with the four Complete Auto factors. (I also agree that California's practice of accepting "reasonable approximations" of the statutorily required financial data does not violate due process. See ante, at ____.) A state tax on foreign commerce, however, must satisfy two additional inquiries: "first, whether the tax, notwithstanding apportionment, creates a substantial risk of international multiple taxation, and, second, whether the tax prevents the Federal Government from 'speaking with one voice when regulating commercial relations with foreign governments.' If a state tax contravenes either of these precepts, it is unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause." Japan Line, Ltd. v. County of Los Angeles, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/441/434" class="subref" title="441 U.S. 434, 451, 99 S.Ct. 1813, 1823, 60 L.Ed.2d 336 (1979)">441 U.S. 434, 451, 99 S.Ct. 1813, 1823, 60 L.Ed.2d 336 (1979)</a> (emphasis added).</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">I am in general agreement with the Court, see ante, at ____, that the second Japan Line factor &#x97; the purported need for federal uniformity &#x97; does not prevent the use of worldwide combined reporting in taxing foreign corporations. The Congress, not the Executive or the Judiciary, has been given the power to regulate commerce. U.S. Const., Art. I, &#xA7; 8, cl. 3. The Legislature has neither approved nor disapproved the California tax. Although in such circumstances courts have the power to scrutinize taxes for consistency with our negative Commerce Clause jurisprudence, this determination should be made on the basis of the objective factors outlined in Complete Auto (and, in the foreign commerce context, the multiple taxation analysis discussed in Japan Line), not statements made and briefs filed by officials in the Executive Branch. Cf. Itel Containers Int'l Corp. v. Huddleston, 507 U.S. ----, ----, 
113 S.Ct. 1095, 1107, 122 L.Ed.2d 421 (1993) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment). Indeed, the inconsistent positions taken by the Solicitor General in the course of Barclays' challenge to the California tax illustrate the perils of resting constitutional determinations on such "evidence." Compare Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 21-24 (arguing that the California tax was constitutionally applied to Barclays during the tax years in question), with Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae in Barclays Bank v. Franchise Tax Board, O.T.1992, No. 92-212, pp. 9-16 (arguing that the imposition of the California tax on Barclays was unconstitutional).</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">But I cannot agree with the Court's resolution of the other Japan Line factor &#x97; the need to avoid international multiple taxation. See ante, at ____. Barclays does 98% of its business in countries other than the United States. California, through application of worldwide combined reporting, taxes some of that income. The trial court found as a fact that "there is a definite risk of, as well as actual double taxation here." App. to Pet. for Cert. A-25. This double taxation occurs because California has adopted a taxing system that is inconsistent with the taxing method used by foreign taxing authorities. California's formula assigns a higher proportion of income to jurisdictions where wage rates, property values, and sales prices are higher; to the extent that California is such a jurisdiction (and it usually will be) the formula inherently leads to double taxation. And whenever the three factors are higher in California, the State will tax income under its formula that already has been taxed by another country under accepted international practice.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">In Container Corp., we recognized that the California tax "had resulted in actual double taxation . . . stemming from a serious divergence in the taxing schemes adopted by California and the foreign taxing authorities," and that "the taxing method adopted by those foreign taxing authorities is consistent with accepted international practice."

We nevertheless held that the tax did not violate the Japan Line principle. Two of the factors on which we relied &#x97; that the tax was on income rather than property, and that the multiple taxation was not "inevitable" &#x97; carry no more force today than they did 11 Terms ago, see

    <p class="pro-indent">We also relied on a third ground to distinguish the tax upheld in Container Corp. from the tax invalidated in Japan Line: "The tax here falls, not on the foreign owners of an instrumentality of foreign commerce, but on a corporation domiciled and headquartered in the United States. We specifically left open in Japan Line the application of that case to 'domestically owned instrumentalities engaged in foreign commerce,' and . . . this case falls clearly within that reservation."

As the Court recognizes, ante, at ____, and n. 15, Barclays' challenge to the California tax therefore presents the question we expressly left open in Container Corp.: does it make a constitutional difference that the multiple taxation resulting from California's use of worldwide combined reporting falls on a foreign corporation rather than a domestic one? In my view, the answer is yes.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Japan Line teaches that where the instrumentality of commerce and analogously, the corporate domicile &#x97; is foreign, the multiple taxation resulting from a state taxing scheme may violate the Commerce Clause even though the same tax would be constitutional as applied to a domestic corporation. 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/441/0" class="subref" title="441 U.S., at 447-448, 99 S.Ct., at 1820-1821">441 U.S., at 447-448, 99 S.Ct., at 1820-1821</a>. When worldwide combined reporting is applied to American corporate groups with foreign affiliates, as in Container Corp., income attributable to those foreign companies will be taxed by California, even though they are also subject to tax in foreign countries. But in such cases the incidence of the tax falls on the domestic parent corporation &#x97; a corporation subject to full taxation in the United States notwithstanding the source of its income. When the California tax is applied to a foreign corporate group with both domestic and foreign affiliates, some of the income of the foreign companies will also be taxed by California. The incidence of the tax in such cases falls on a foreign corporation, even though the United States (and its subnational governments) is entitled to tax only the income earned domestically.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">In my view, the States are prohibited (absent express congressional authorization) by the Foreign Commerce Clause from adopting a system of taxation that, because it does not conform to international practice, results in multiple taxation of foreign corporations. It may be that such a rule "leaves California free to discriminate against a Delaware corporation in favor of an overseas corporation," Container Corp., supra, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/463/0" class="subref" title="463 U.S., at 203, 103 S.Ct., at 2960">463 U.S., at 203, 103 S.Ct., at 2960</a> (Powell, J., dissenting), but the reason for this differential treatment is obvious. Domestic taxpayers have access to the political process, at both the state and national levels, that foreign taxpayers simply do not enjoy. If California's tax results in intolerable double taxation of domestic corporations, those companies can seek redress through the normal channels. Cf. Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery Co., 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/449/456" class="subref" title="449 U.S. 456, 473, n. 17, 101 S.Ct. 715, 728, n. 17, 66 L.Ed.2d 659 (1981)">449 U.S. 456, 473, n. 17, 101 S.Ct. 715, 728, n. 17, 66 L.Ed.2d 659 (1981)</a>; Raymond Motor Transportation, Inc. v. Rice,

It is all too easy, however, for the state legislature to fill the State's coffers at the expense of outsiders.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Most of the United States' trading partners have objected to California's use of worldwide combined reporting. See Demarche from Danish Embassy, on behalf of Governments of European Community (Mar. 26, 1993) ("The views of the EC Member States on worldwide unitary taxation are well known to the United States Government. All Member States have expressed their strong opposition to the California tax in a number of diplomatic communiques to the United States Government from 1980 to the present date"); Demarche from Belgian Embassy, on behalf of Governments of Member States of European Community and of Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland (Sept. 23, 1993). At least one country has already enacted retaliatory legislation. See Brief of Government of United Kingdom as Amicus Curiae 19-23. Moreover, the possibility of multiple taxation undoubtedly deters foreign investment in this country. See Brief of Member States of the European Communities et al. as Amici Curiae 14-16. These adverse consequences, which affect the Nation as a whole, result solely from California's refusal to conform its taxing practices to the internationally accepted standard.</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">Unlike the Court, see ante, at ____, I would not dismiss these difficulties solely by relying on our observation in Container Corp. that "it would be perverse, simply for the sake of avoiding double taxation, to require California to give up one allocation method that sometimes results in double taxation in favor of another allocation method that also sometimes results in double taxation." 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/463/0" class="subref" title="463 U.S., at 193, 103 S.Ct., at 2955">463 U.S., at 193, 103 S.Ct., at 2955</a>. In addition to being factually incorrect, see 
id., at 199, n. 1, 103 S.Ct., at 2957-2958, n. 1 (Powell, J., dissenting), our discussion of alternatives in Container Corp. proceeded from the well-established proposition that States need not conform their taxing practices to those of their neighbors, at least so far as domestic commerce is concerned. See, e.g., Moorman Mfg. Co. v. Bair, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/437/267" class="subref" title="437 U.S. 267, 277-281, 98 S.Ct. 2340, 2346-2349, 57 L.Ed.2d 197 (1978)">437 U.S. 267, 277-281, 98 S.Ct. 2340, 2346-2349, 57 L.Ed.2d 197 (1978)</a>. Multiple taxation of domestic companies is avoided, to the extent necessary, by the fair apportionment requirement. See Container Corp., supra, 
<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt//text/463/0" class="subref" title="463 U.S., at 185, 103 S.Ct., at 2950-2951">463 U.S., at 185, 103 S.Ct., at 2950-2951</a>; General Motors Corp. v. Washington,

    <p class="pro-indent">But in Japan Line we squarely rejected the argument that the same principle applies to taxes imposed on foreign-owned instrumentalities:</p>
    <p class="pro-indent">"Neither this Court nor this Nation can ensure full apportionment when one of the taxing entities is a foreign sovereign. If an instrumentality of commerce is domiciled abroad, the country of domicile may have the right, consistently with the custom of nations, to impose a tax on its full value. If a State should seek to tax the same instrumentality on an apportioned basis, multiple taxation inevitably results. . . . Due to the absence of an authoritative tribunal capable of ensuring that the aggregation of taxes is computed on no more than one full value, a state tax, even though 'fairly apportioned' to reflect an instrumentality's presence within the State, may subject foreign commerce to the risk of a double tax burden to which domestic commerce is not exposed, and which the commerce clause forbids."

    <p class="pro-indent">In my view, the risk of multiple taxation created by California's use of worldwide combined reporting &#x97; a risk that has materialized with respect to Barclays &#x97; is sufficient to render the California tax constitutionally infirm. I therefore respectfully dissent from the Court's conclusion to the contrary.</p>

    <p class="footnote">The trial court, however, did not reach the conclusion the United Kingdom suggests it did, nor was there cause for it so to do.

Id., at 26.  Formulary apportionment of the income of a multijurisdictional (but unitary) business enterprise, if fairly done, taxes only the "income generated within a State." Allied-Signal, Inc. v.

Quill held that the Commerce Clause requires a taxpayer's "physical presence" in the taxing jurisdiction before that jurisdiction can constitutionally impose a use tax.  The California presence of the taxpayers before us is undisputed, and we find nothing in Quill to suggest that California may not reference the income of corporations worldwide with whom those taxpayers are closely intertwined in order to approximate the taxpayers' California income.</p>

[W]e are faced with two distinct methods of allocating the income of a multinational enterprise.  The 'arm's-length' approach divides the pie on the basis of formal accounting principles.  The formula apportionment method divides the same pie on the basis of a mathematical generalization. Whether the combination of the two methods results in the same income being taxed twice or in some portion of income not being taxed at all is dependent solely on the facts of the individual case."

    <p class="footnote"> The governments of many of our trading partners have expressed their strong disapproval of California's method of taxation, as demonstrated by the amici briefs in support of Barclays from the Government of the United Kingdom, and from the Member States of the European Communities (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain) and the Governments of Australia, Austria, Canada, Finland, Japan, Norway, Sweden, and Switzerland.  Barclays has also directed our attention to a series of diplomatic notes similarly protesting the tax.  See, e.g., App. in No. 92-1384, pp. A-92 to A-123, A-127 to A-128, A-131 to A-138; see also p.

The British Parliament has gone further, enacting retaliatory legislation that would, if implemented, tax United States corporations on dividends they receive from their United Kingdom subsidiaries.

    <p class="footnote"> Pursuant to &#xA7; 201 of 
Pub.L. 86-272, 
73 Stat. 556, in which Congress undertook to "make full and complete studies of all matters pertaining to the taxation . . . of interstate commerce . . . by the States," the House Committee on the Judiciary held extensive hearings on the (primarily domestic) implications of alternative tax apportionment schemes.  See State Income Taxation of Mercantile and Manufacturing Corporations:  Hearings before the Special Subcommittee on State Taxation of Interstate Commerce of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 87th Cong., 1st Sess. (1961).

No. 952, 89th Cong., 1st Sess. 1144 (1965), and that States be required to refrain from taxing any foreign income exempt from federal taxation.  Id., at 1135.

    <p class="footnote"> The Solicitor General suggests that when a court analyzes "whether a state tax impairs the federal government's ability to speak with one voice . . . the statements of executive branch officials are entitled to substantial evidentiary weight," Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae, p. 19, but he argues that the constitutionality of a State's taxing practice must be assessed according to the federal policy, if any, in effect at the time the challenged taxes were assessed.  He asserts that federal officials had not articulated a policy opposing use by the States of worldwide combined reporting prior to the mid-1980's, and urges the Court to affirm the judgments below on the ground that California's use of worldwide combined reporting was not unconstitutional during the years here at issue, even if it became unconstitutional in later years (a question on which he takes no position, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 38-41).  Colgate, on the other hand, suggests that the relevant time frame is "when the tax is definitively enforced by the state taxing authority, through judicial proceedings if necessary, not when the tax technically accrues under state law," Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 92-1839, p. 7, and argues in the alternative that a federal policy opposing combined worldwide reporting had been established as of 1970-1973, id., at 9.  We need not resolve this dispute, because we have concluded that the Executive statements criticizing States' use of worldwide combined reporting do not, in light of Congress' acquiescence in the States' actions, authorize judicial intervention here.</p>
